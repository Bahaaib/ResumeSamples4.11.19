        Welcome!<br>
        <br>
        This app contains a superb, easy to use Cover Letter Builder as
        well as valuable information about writing your Cover Letter.
        You are welcome to use as much or as little of it as you like.<br>
        <br>
        Go through the information about Cover Letters, first. This
        gives you valuable help about how to write your Cover Letter.<br>
        <br>
        Click on the menu item called Cover Letter Builder to start
        creating your Cover Letter. It is simple to use. Remember, you
        can download the finished letter to your device or you can email
        it to yourself or anyone else.&nbsp; The Cover Letter should
        save to your Download folder. Files can sometimes be difficult
        to find on mobile devices so just email it to yourself if you
        cannot find it after downloading.<br>
        <br>
        The Cover Letter will save as a Word file (.docx) so that you
        can use your desktop computer or mobile device to make it even
        better, if you wish. Remember to save it as a PDF when you have
        finished editing it to send to employers.<br>
        <br>
        There is a selection of Cover Letter Templates in this app for
        you to use. We will be adding more - so please keep this app on
        your device and check back for updates.<br>
        <br>
        BONUS - You can now download the Cover Letter Templates used in
        the Cover Letter Builder as blank documents for free. See the
        app's Home Screen for details.<br>
        <br>
        This app is in Beta mode which means we have completely
        redeveloped it and you are one of the first people to use it.
        Please send us your feedback if you get any problems so we can
        fix things. We'd love to hear from you :) There's a Contact
        Developer page lower down the app.<br>
        <br>
