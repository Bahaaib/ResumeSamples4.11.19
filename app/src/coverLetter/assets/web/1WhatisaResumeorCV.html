1 - What is a Resume or CV (curriculum vitae)?</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The resume is a
selling tool that outlines your skills and experiences so an employer
can see, at a glance, how you can contribute to the employer's
workplace. Your resume has to sell you in short order. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While you may
have all the requirements for a particular position, your resume is a
failure if the employer does not instantly come to the conclusion that
you "have what it takes." The first hurdle your resume has to
pass--whether it ends up in the "consider file" or the "reject
file"--may take less than thirty seconds. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The most
effective resumes are clearly focused on a specific job title and
address the employer's stated requirements for the position. The more
you know about the duties and skills required for the job--and organize
your resume around these points--the more effective the resume. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You will need
information to write a good resume. Not just information about jobs
you've held in the past but also information to select the most
relevant accomplishments, skills and experience for THIS position. The
more you know about the employer and the position, the more you can
tailor your resume to fit the job.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Some people
think of a resume as their "life on a page," but how could anyone put
everything important about herself on a single piece of paper (or two)?
Actually, resumes are much more specific, including only relevant
information about you for specific employers. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Like a life,
however, a resume is always growing and changing. As your career goals
shift or the job market changes--as you grow personally and
professionally--chances are you will need to re-write your resume or at
least create new versions. Writing a resume is a lifelong process.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How do you know
what in your life--past, present, and future--is most relevant to
prospective employers? How do you select which information to include?
The quick answer to both these questions is "it depends." It depends on
your individual career goals as well as on the professional goals of
the companies hiring in your area or field of interest. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In the end, only
you, through research, planning, questioning and self-reflection, can
determine the shape and content of your resume, but the strategies
below along with those on the job search can help you ask the right
questions and begin exploring your options. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Depending on
whom you ask, a resume may be viewed as the single most important
vehicle to securing your next job, or it may be viewed as an
unnecessary nuisance. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In both cases,
this is incorrect. A resume is a professional introduction meant to
encourage a one-on-one interview situation - the opportunity for
communication that can lead to a job offer.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is a rare
candidate who is hired by his or her resume alone. It is just as rare
to be offered an interview without one.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A resume is
often the first line of contact. It establishes a first impression of a
potential job candidate's skills, background and hiring value. If
written well, this impression can be a positive one, offering the
reader a sense of the candidate's "fit" for the position and company
being targeted. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If written
really well, it may convince the reader that the job candidate is
ideally suited for the job. When coupled with an effective cover
letter, the resume can be a very strong marketing tool. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Preparing a
resume may be seen as a nuisance, but having a well-constructed,
well-designed resume is an important part of your job search. Consider
that for each available job opening there may be as many as 100 to 1000
resumes submitted. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If your resume
fails to adequately and accurately convey your hiring value (for the
specific position), fails to establish your hiring value over competing
candidates, or is difficult to follow, your ability to compete against
those 100 to 1000 professionals vying for the same position your are
will be greatly diminished. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If your resume
secures an interview, it has done its job. If it sets you ahead of the
competition in the mind of your interviewer, then it has given you a
distinct advantage, and has gone beyond its job.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A great resume
does what all good marketing pieces do: it sells the "consumer" (the
potential employer or hiring manager) on the "product" (you).</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Like it or not,
the job of looking for employment is a job in sales and marketing. The
product you are "selling" is you, and the "customer," who has unique
needs and interests, needs to be sold on the fact that you have what it
takes to get the job done and to meet the needs of the position. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">He or she is
going to want to know how you are going to solve his or her problems,
and he or she is going to give your resume about 15 seconds, or less,
to sell this. 15 seconds is the average time a hiring manager will
allot to a new resume - before giving it a potential "yes" or "no"
response.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The resume will
not get you the job (well, it has happened, but it is extremely rare),
but it can certainly secure your chances of being seen and interviewed,
just as it can cause you to be passed over in favor of a candidate who
offers a better presentation. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As with any type
of marketing campaign, use your resume as one tool in your search.
Continue to network, improve your interviewing skills, and use every
avenue available to you to better your chances and opportunities. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">And, after you
have secured that next position, do this all over again. Always be
prepared for the next opportunity. Keep your resume up-to-date and stay
career fit.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So, essentially,
a resume is you in short form on paper.&nbsp; That is why having a good
looking, easy to read resume is so important.&nbsp; Let's look at a few
suggestions about your resume from the professionals.</span><br
