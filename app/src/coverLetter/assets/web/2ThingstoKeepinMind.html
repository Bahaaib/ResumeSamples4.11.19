2 - Things to Keep in Mind</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In preparing
your resume, the more you know about the position you are targeting,
the better. If you know the company's missions and goals, if you
understand the needs of the position, if you recognize the company's
"concerns," and if you know who comprises the company's competition,
you will be prepared.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">AND you (and
your unique skills and experience) can meet the needs of all the above
(you have accurately assessed your own value to those who have employed
you in the past), you will have the material necessary to create an
effective marketing piece. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As in any type
of marketing material, it is important to present the information so
that it captures your customer's interest quickly. Your goal is to
encourage the reader to stay with your document as long as possible.
Your chance for a more detailed reading increases when you give the
reader that information which he or she most wants to secure, early in
the document. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One of the best
ways to accomplish this is to create a Summary Section at the beginning
of your resume. A Summary Section highlights for your reader those
personal and professional skills you possess that allow you to excel in
your chosen field and position. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Items and skills
of greatest importance (from your readers' viewpoint) should be listed
in priority, supporting an impression of both "fit" and potential
success. In addition, these should be aspects of your background that
set you apart from your competing candidates, particularly candidates
with skill sets similar to your own. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You are, in
effect, showing your reader how you will solve their problems - better
than the competition - and why interviewing you will be a worthwhile
expenditure of their time.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You are not
writing your resume in order to put your career autobiography out there
for posterity. This is not about you - seriously. It is about how you
can meet the needs of your reader - in this particular position at this
particular company. It is all about them. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">During the
interview is when your first opportunity for negotiation takes place
and you get to discuss what you get out of the deal. But right now, the
only person who matters is your reader. They hold all the marbles.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When writing
your resume, keep in mind your specific reader. Listing information
that will be of no value to the position or company being targeted is
just a waste of time. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Check for
redundancy in your statements. If the positions you have held are
similar, then repeating the same functions in detail throughout your
document is unnecessary (heard it, got it). However, do not
short-change yourself on your accomplishments. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your potential
employer is most interested in seeing how hiring you will benefit
him/her and the company. If you are dealing with a hiring manager or
human resource director, you can bet he or she has a lot resting on the
fact that, if you are hired, they found the right person for the job. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is expensive
to hire, train, and let someone go - and it is their job to make sure
this does not happen. All parties involved want to know they are making
the right decision, and it is your job to assure them that they are.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The most
effective way to do this is by identifying how you have benefited
employers in the past. Take credit for your participation and
accomplishments. While looking at the aspects of your background may
seem minor or of little value to you, they may be seen as a valuable
asset to those looking to fill a need.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The layout of
your resume is extremely important. Your resume needs to maintain a
"clean" and professional appearance (remember, it is representing
you!). It should allow the reader to access the information quickly.
Neat margins, adequate "white space" between groupings, and indenting
to highlight text, aid the ease of reference and retention of the
material. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Use "bolding"
and italics sparingly. Overuse of these features actually diminishes
their effectiveness of promoting the material they are intended
highlight. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your contact
information (how the reader can reach you) is essentially the most
important information in the entire document. Make certain your name,
address, phone number, and e-mail address (if included) are clearly
visible and at the top of your document (from habit, this is where your
reader will look for this information - do not make them search for
it). </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
including additional pages, be certain that your name is on these
secondary pages.&nbsp; Consider including your phone number here, too,
in case your sheets become separated.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The standards
for resume length have changed. It used to be typical for resumes to be
one-page in length, and no longer. For candidates with years of
experience, having held multiple positions, or with outstanding
achievements, this one-page constraint often results in a document that
is unreadable, looks "squashed," or utilizes a font size so small that
the reader is required to squint (no, they won't actually bother). The
one-page standard no longer holds true. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Use as much
space as you need to concisely, accurately, and effectively communicate
your skills, history, achievements, and accomplishments - as these
relate to the position and company being targeted. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A two-page
document, if presented well, will not diminish the effectiveness of
your marketing strategy - as long as the information you provide is
relevant and valuable to your reader's goals and interests. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A three-page
resume is requiring much of your reader's time (and patience), and may
not be as effective as a more concise presentation. In academic fields
and European markets, it may be necessary to go over two pages in
length, but only provide this much information if you absolutely can
not present your history and achievements in less.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
certain your reader will agree with you, they will not mind reading a
resume over three pages. An overly long presentation may leave your
reader wondering if you can be concise in anything you do. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Document in
detail your most recent 10-15 years of employment and/or experience.
Longer if the most recent position extended 10 years or more. Be
certain to document growth in a company where multiple positions have
been held, including identification of promotions and increased
responsibilities. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">List positions
held prior to this in decreasing detail, unless a previous position
more effectively documents relevant skills for the position you are
currently targeting.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You want to
entice you reader into wanting to meet you (the interview) to learn
more. Current history and recently utilized skills will hold the most
value.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Remember, you
will have an opportunity to expand on the information in your resume
during the interview. So, entice your reader to want to learn more, but
don't forget to leave something to tell. </span><br
