5 - The Cover Letter</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The purpose of a
cover letter is to introduce you and your resume as well as give some
additional information about yourself to potential employers.&nbsp; You
may also want to point out some parts of your resume you want the
employer to pay special attention to.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">An individually
typed cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send
out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your cover letter may make the difference between
obtaining a job interview and having your resume ignored. It makes
sense to devote the necessary time and effort to write effective cover
letters. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A cover letter
should complement, not duplicate your resume. Its purpose is to
interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch. A
cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential
employer, creating a critical first impression.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are three
different kinds of cover letters:</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The application letter responds to a specific job opening you have seen
advertised</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The prospecting letter inquires about any job openings</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your
job search</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
sending out a resume, your application cover letter should always
include a line in your cover letter that says where you found the
advertisement for the job you are applying for.&nbsp; If you saw it in
a newspaper, be sure to underline the name of the newspaper (grammar
rules count!)</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You should
always tailor your cover letter to the specific job you are applying
for.&nbsp; It's certainly easier to write generic or blanket cover
letters than it is to write a cover letter specifically targeted to
each position you apply for. However, if you don't invest the time in
writing cover letters you're probably not going to get the interview,
regardless of your qualifications.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Our first tip in
writing a cover letter that works is to make a match between your
qualifications and education with the job.&nbsp; This takes some time
and effort and it's not always easy, but, it's important. Take the job
posting and list the criteria the employer is looking for. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Then list the
skills and experience you have. Either address to how your skills match
the job in paragraph form or list the criteria and your qualifications.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do not design a
form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you
do with junk mail!). </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Effective cover
letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific
organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences
(remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).
They should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the
position. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To be effective,
your cover letter should follow the basic format of a typical business
letter and should address three general issues:</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First Paragraph - Why you are writing </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Middle Paragraphs - What you have to offer </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Concluding Paragraph - How you will follow-up</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In some cases,
you may have been referred to a potential employer by a friend or
acquaintance. Be sure to mention this mutual contact, by name, up front
since it is likely to encourage your reader to keep reading! </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
writing in response to a job posting, indicate where you learned of the
position and the title of the position. More importantly, express your
enthusiasm and the likely match between your credentials and the
position's qualifications.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
writing a prospecting letter a letter in which you inquire about
possible job openings - state your specific job objective. Since this
type of letter is unsolicited, it is even more important to capture the
reader's attention.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
writing a networking letter to approach an individual for information,
make your request clear.&nbsp; The advantage to writing a letter like
this and including your resume is that you will be making contacts in
the business world and when a job opening comes up, they may still have
your resume on file.&nbsp; It never hurts to be pro-active when looking
for a job!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In responding to
an advertisement, refer specifically to the qualifications listed and
illustrate how your particular abilities and experiences relate to the
position for which you are applying. In a prospecting letter express
your potential to fulfill the employer's needs rather than focus on
what the employer can offer you. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You can do this
by giving evidence that you have researched the organization thoroughly
and that you possess skills used within that organization. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Emphasize your
achievements and problem-solving skills. Show how your education and
work skills are transferable, and thus relevant, to the position for
which you are applying.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Close by
reiterating your interest in the job and letting the employer know how
they can reach you and include your phone number and/or email address.
If you want, you can make a bid directly for the job interview or
informational interview and indicate that you will follow-up with a
telephone call to set up an appointment at a mutually convenient time.
Be sure to make the call within the time frame indicated. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In some
instances, an employer may explicitly prohibit phone calls or you may
be responding to a *blind want-ad* which precludes you from this
follow-up. Unless this is the case, make your best effort to reach the
organization. At the very least, you should confirm that your materials
were received and that your application is complete. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
applying from outside the employer's geographic area you may want to
indicate if you'll be in town during a certain time frame (this makes
it easier for the employer to agree to meet with you). </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In conclusion,
you may indicate that your references are available on request. Also,
if you have a portfolio or writing samples to support your
qualifications, state their availability.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So, we've
covered the three most important documents you need in a job
search:&nbsp; the resume, the cover letter, and the reference
sheet.&nbsp; Before you get excited and start mailing out your
creations, there are some things that you need to do prior to that.</span><br
