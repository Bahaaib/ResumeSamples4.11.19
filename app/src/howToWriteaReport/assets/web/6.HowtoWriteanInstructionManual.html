    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Have you been
            assigned the job of creating an instruction manual or
            employee handbook? Are you wondering how to go about
            accomplishing this
            task?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Don't panic.
            You probably already know all the information you need
            to include, or at least you know where to find it. Now all
            you need to
            learn is the process and the structure.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">To start,
            write a description of the audience your manual or
            handbook is intended for. What do they know already? What do
            they need
            to learn? What are their goals? What are the goals of the
            manual or
            handbook? You may want to discuss this audience description
            and goals
            with colleagues or your boss to make sure you're including
            everyone and
            planning to meet the needs of the organization.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Next, make a
            list of all the topics you need to include. Do these
            topics need to be in a specific sequence to be understood or
            learned?
            In other words, does one section build on information
            learned in the
            previous section? Or do topics / procedures need to be
            grouped by
            category, such as "Employee Benefits" or "Troubleshooting
            Procedures"?
            If so, order your topics accordingly. Then share your
            outline with
            others and request their input to make sure you've thought
            of
            everything. Get approval if needed. This outline will become
            the basis
            for the table of contents in your manual. Now you're ready
            to get
            started writing the body of your manual or handbook.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Although you
            could write in any sequence to fill in your outline,
            we'll start at the beginning. First you'll need a Title Page
            with a
            descriptive name, like "How to Use the ZYX Printer" or
            "Smith
            Corporation Employee Handbook." Next should be a copyright
            page, which
            should contain the date of printing and information about
            ownership by
            the author, company, or publisher. This page sometimes
            includes
            disclaimers, such as a statement saying the publisher and
            author are
            not responsible for misinformation that might be included or
            for any
            information that was left out. If you find you have a lot of
            disclaimers or a lengthy legal explanation, you should put
            that on a
            separate Disclaimers page.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Next will be
            your Table of Contents, but the odds are that you will
            need to create and insert that after you have completed
            writing your
            manual, so for now, just keep in mind that it belongs here.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The first
            page you will probably want in the body of your manual is
            an Introduction, where you'll explain the purpose and goals
            of the
            document. You can also include here any assumptions you are
            making,
            such as that all your readers are using a specific operating
            system or
            that they are familiar with standard medical devices, for
            example. If
            you need to list a lot of Assumptions, include them on a
            separate page.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now you're
            ready to write the main content of your manual or
            handbook, with all the procedures or topics your readers
            need to know.
            After you've written all your topics, you may want to end
            with a
            Conclusions or Summary page, and perhaps include an Index to
            help
            readers find easily find topics.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Does that
            sound like too much work? Keep in mind that you don't need
            to start off with a blank word processing screen to do all
            this. Using
            a pre-designed kit can help tremendously. The templates in a
            kit can
            give you a big jump start on creating your manual, and help
            you at each
            step along the way. Each template contains suggestions and
            examples of
            information to include on that page. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">There are
            more than a thousand topic templates, including templates
            for all those pages mentioned above in a kit. You can
            probably find
            precisely the topic you're looking for, but if by chance you
            don't, a
            well-designed document building kit contains templates that
            you can
            adapt for any purpose. For employee manuals, there are many
            company-oriented topics like Mission Statement,
            Organizational
            Structure, and Ethics, just to name a few. The templates are
            Word
            documents, so you can easily adapt them for your use, and
            you can
            insert graphics like charts, illustrations, and photos.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Any manual or
            handbook is likely to be read by a large audience, so
            you want to be sure that the grammar and spelling are
            perfect. It's
            always best to use a professional editor if you can, but if
            that's not
            in the budget, then enlist someone who is not familiar with
            your
            manual's content to proofread it. Testing is an essential
            component of
            finalizing any "how-to" or informational booklet, too. You
            want to be
            sure that your instructions are clear, complete, and useful
            for your
            intended readers. You might also need to get the approval of
            your
            company's legal department before publication,
            too--corporate attorneys
            and personnel departments are often concerned about
            employment issues,
            trademarks, and all sorts of consumer information that may
            cause legal
            issues in the future.</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">A business
            document writing kit is perfect for assembling any kind
            of Word document. Using the included Wizard software, you
            simply pick
            the templates you want and fill them in, and then let the
            assembly
            software do the page numbering and create a table of
            contents for you,
            as well as take care of the cover page and any appendices. A
            pre-designed document writing kit handles the layout and
            design of your
            manual, so getting started with a kit not only helps you
            write like a
            professional, but also makes your finished work look
            professional, too.</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Your final
            manual or handbook can easily be printed and bound, or
            transformed into a PDF file to send via email or read on any
            electronic
            device. You can even use various tools available on the
            Internet to
            translate your masterpiece into an e-book for use with
            Kindle or other
            electronic devices.</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You'll find
            that using a pre-designed document writing kit is great
            for producing and organizing any kind of document. It's a
