          Writing business letters is a forgotten art. The Internet has
          made us
          lazy writers. With a few keystrokes, we can kick off a short
          e-mail
          without thinking much about content, much less formatting.
          Have you
          ever reviewed your own e-mails and discovered misspellings,
          incomplete
          sentences, formatting mistakes, and grammatical errors?
          Usually we
          think nothing about how our lazy writing negatively affects
          our
          e-mails; other people e-mail us the same type of junk all the
          time.
          But, still, writing lousy e-mails should not give us the
          excuse to be
          lazy writers all the time, online or offline.<br>
          <br>
          Writing business letters may be one of the best skills a
          business
          person can possess, especially during these times when few
          people
          possess it. The following tips will help you to construct
          better
          business letters. You can also adapt these principles to write
          better
          business e-mails, in terms of both format, style and tone.<br>
          <br>
          COMPONENTS AND FORMATTING<br>
          <br>
          All business letters are comprised of the following elements,
          in this
          order:<br>
          <br>
          Date<br>
          Recipient’s name and address<br>
          Salutation<br>
          Opening paragraph<br>
          Body<br>
          Closing paragraph<br>
          Closing<br>
          Your name and address<br>
          <br>
          The style of formatting will dictate how these elements are
          situated on
          the page. The three most common formatting styles are:<br>
          <br>
          BLOCK: Each part of the letter is left-justified, and the text
          is
          single-spaced, except double-spaced paragraph breaks.<br>
          <br>
          MODIFIED BLOCK: The opening, body and closing paragraphs are
          left-justified and single-spaced, but the date, closing and
          salutation
          are center-aligned.<br>
          <br>
          SEMI-BLOCK: Exactly like modified block, except each paragraph
          is
          indented, not left-justified.<br>
          <br>
          Regardless of which style you choose, you’ll also need to
          consider the font; your choice is important, as fancy fonts
          are
          sometimes&nbsp; unreadable. The most commonly used and widely
          accepted
          font is Times New Roman, size 12. It’s readable, professional,
          and universally used for business letters. It’s not outside
          the
          realm of possibility, however, to take liberties here; you can
          really
          use any readable font (Arial, Verdana, Helvetica), but always
          consider
          what your recipient would like to see.<br>
          <br>
          OPENING PARAGRAPH<br>
          <br>
          Since the principle point of your business letter is to grab
          and keep
          the reader’s attention, you’ll need to focus on the
          opening, the first (and sometimes only) opportunity you have
          to grab
          the recipient’s attention. The opening also sets the tone for
          the
          entire letter, so it must be as strong and characteristic as
          possible.<br>
          <br>
          DO get straight to the point. Your recipient doesn’t need a
          bunch
          of unnecessary info., especially not right up front. If it
          doesn’t pertain to or bores them, they’ll just stop reading.<br>
          <br>
          DON’T start with cliché phrases like “I am writing
          because...” or “With regards to...”. This simply
          appears that you don’t know where to start. The real message
          won’t start until after those phrases, so why not eliminate
          the
          unnecessary and uncreative words?<br>
          <br>
          DO use strong, active verbs. This keeps the focus on the
          reader and
          makes the letter far more interesting. For instance, instead
          of writing
          “this offer is being extended to you for a brief period of
          time,” try “we’re briefly extending this offer to
          you.” See how much easier that is?<br>
          <br>
          DON’T get longwinded. Keep the opening short and to-the-point,
          use the best words possible, and never make the reader work
          for the
          point of the letter.<br>
          <br>
          BODY<br>
          <br>
          This is the meat of the letter, where you’ll fully explain the
          ideas introduced in the opening. It’s easy to lose momentum
          here,
          but this part must be every bit as strong as the opening.<br>
          <br>
          DO write like talk. This doesn’t mean using informal slang or
          profanity, but why lapse into business speak when it’s trite
          and
          boring? Chances are, you aren’t a 19th century British
          gentleman,
          so don’t write like one! Use a conversation, yet respectful,
          tone
          and try to phrase things similarly to how you’d actually say
          them.<br>
          <br>
          DON’T lose the point. Save the digressions for a face-to-face
          chat. You’ve got a short time to hold the reader’s interest
          here and off-point sentences will simply give your reader time
          to yawn
          and put the letter down. List the points you need to make
          prior to
          writing, and stick to them.<br>
          <br>
          DO keep related information together. Don’t move on to another
          point until you’ve finished the last, and resist the urge to
          scatter topics haphazardly. Anything less and you’ll appear to
          be
          rambling with no sense of focus.<br>
          <br>
          DON’T get pedantic. Sure, it’s nice to show off our
          vocabularies, but that big word has little point if a smaller
          word
          would be more effective and readable. Put the thesaurus away
          and use
          familiar language.<br>
          <br>
          CLOSING PARAGRAPH<br>
          <br>
          This paragraph is the last string of sentences your reader
          will see, so
          it needs to be as strong as the rest of the letter.<br>
          <br>
          DO keep it short. The closing paragraph can be the briefest
          part of the
          letter as you’re simply restating, in simple language, what
          you’ve already written. Restate your point and sign off.<br>
          <br>
          DON’T fizzle out. It’s tempting to let the closing
          paragraph sort of die quickly or be an exact replica of other
          sentences
          simply because you’ve already worked so hard on the rest.
          Resist
          that urge -- keep the ending strong, and hold your
          conversational tone.<br>
          <br>
          DO be clear about your intentions. If you’re looking for an
          email
          response or a business meeting, make that clear. The point of
          your
          letter will be lost if the reader has little idea what you
          want from
          them or how to proceed from here.<br>
          <br>
          DON’T get trite. Avoid typical cliché endings like
          “Thank you in advance...” or “Please do not hesitate
          to call...”; this ends the business letter on a weak note. Be
          as
          direct and creative as possible without falling prey to
          typical
          business language.<br>
