    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Have you been
            assigned the job of creating a report for your
            organization? Does that task seem completely daunting? It
            doesn't have
            to be. First of all, you or various people or departments
            within your
            organization have all the information you need to include.
            Second, you
            have plenty of examples and formatting help available to
            help you
            produce the report.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">There are
            many types and lengths of reports. Some might be one-page
            summaries, and others could be hundreds of pages long. The
            most common
            report you are likely to need to produce is a project
            report, where you
            summarize what the project was intended to accomplish and
            how well it
            met its goals. But there are also meeting reports, status
            reports,
            monthly and quarterly reports, all kinds of studies and
            research
            reports, and annual reports.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It's
            important to consider the audience for each type of report.
            Who
            will your readers be? Are they your colleagues who already
            know all
            about your organization and your field, or do the readers
            include
            people like shareholders and interested members of the
            general public
            for whom you will need to include background information and
            more
            in-depth explanations? </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Also consider
            the goals of the report itself. Are they to analyze
            and compare results in a scientific fashion, or does the
            report have a
            marketing element, too? For example, annual reports
            summarize an
            organization's activities and financial status, but annual
            reports also
            generally include sections that list the organization's
            products or
            services and emphasize their successes, because annual
            reports are used
            by shareholders and potential partners and investors to
            determine
            whether investing in the organization is worthwhile.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Although each
            report will include information specific to that
            organization and its activities, all good reports follow a
            basic
            structure and include many of the same types of information.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Each report
            should include these sections within the body of the
            report:</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Goal(s) of
            the project, meeting, or study you are reporting on. For
            example, were you meeting to determine a new marketing
            strategy for the
            next year? Did your organization recently migrate from one
            software
            system to another? Did your organization make an effort to
            improve
            safety or other conditions on the job? Is your objective to
            compare the
            latest results of a process or the most recent sales of
            products or
            services to past results?</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Analysis of
            the decisions made or the project results. This section
            may include statistical summaries and patterns found in the
            data.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Conclusions.
            Did the project, meeting, or study achieve its goals?
            What are the implications for the future?</font></big></big></p>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The pages
            that go into each section will vary with each
            organization, project, and type of report. If you are
            writing a report
            on a short meeting, you may only have one or two pages that
            include the
            information listed above. For now, let's assume you're
            writing a longer
            report and explore the structure you'll need.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As with any
            lengthy business document, you'll start off with a Title
            Page and a Table of Contents. Next, you may want to include
            a summary
            of the important summary points for the high-level readers
            who will
            only skim your report--this is typically called an Executive
            Summary.
            In an annual report from an organization, this summary is
            usually
            included in a Letter to Shareholders written by the head of
            the
            organization.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you need
            to include a Background section, this is where you'll
            explain the history leading up to the project, meeting, or
            study. Often
            this includes the reasons a project or study was undertaken.
            Including
            background will help readers understand what happened and
            help them to
            judge the results. You may want to include Needs Assessment
            and
            Entities Affected pages here as well.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the Goals
            section, you will summarize the Goals and Objectives of
            the project, meeting, or study. In other words, what results
            was the
            project, meeting, or study intended to achieve? Be as
            specific as
            possible. You might need pages with titles like Client
            Expectations or
            Expected Results, and don't forget to include any original
            Budget and
            Schedule goals, as well as any Limitations that were placed
            on the
            project.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the
            Summary or Project Description section, you will describe
            what happened during the course of the project, meeting, or
            study. If
            you are writing a progress report during the course of a
            project, you
            will describe what has happened from the beginning up to the
            report
            date. If you are writing a monthly, quarterly, or annual
            report, you
            will summarize events in that specific time period. If you
            are writing
            a summary report after a project or study has concluded,
            you'll write a
            description of the entire project.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Depending on
            the type of report you are writing, you may need pages
            such as Accounting, Acquisitions, Advertising, Awards and
            Achievements,
            Fieldwork, Cross-Promotion, Data Collection, Diagnostics,
            Testing,
            Expenses, Experiments, Exploration, Investigation,
            Monitoring,
            Observations, Operating Costs, Schedule of Events, Training,
            Profit and
            Loss Statement--this list of potential topics is endless,
            because the
            information you include in this section all depend on the
            events you
            are reporting on. Use all the topics you need to thoroughly
            explain
            what happened.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you are
            writing an annual report for an organization or a report
            of a very complex project, this Summary section may need to
            be divided
            into subsections with descriptions of what took place in
            different
            departments within the organization, or what happened during
            different
            phases of the project. In these cases, you'll need to
            collect that
            information from a variety of leaders who were in charge of
            different
            activities.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the
            Analysis section, you'll report on how well expectations and
            goals were met. You may need to explain how you collected
            the data
            behind statistical measurements, and how you determined
            whether goals
            were met. In this section, you might include pages with
            titles like
            Measurements, Findings, Accuracy, Benchmark Results,
            Challenges,
            Calculations, Customer Satisfaction, Discoveries, Failures,
            Successes,
            Present Situation, and Performance. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Reports that
            include a lot of detailed financial information, such
            as an annual report, often include detailed explanations
            that accompany
            the financial figures, as well as an independent auditor's
            report
            stating that the financial information is accurate.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The final
            section of a report should be a Conclusions section. In
            this section, you may include topics like Consequences,
            Significance,
            Income Projection, Lessons Learned, and Next Steps--whatever
            suits your
            purpose to wrap up your report. In the case of a report that
            has a
            marketing or public relations purpose, topics such as Growth
            Areas,
            Successes, and Future Potential are usually emphasized.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">After the
            body of a complex financial or scientific report, you may
            need to include Appendices, too - lists of statistics,
            diagrams,
            charts, a bibliography or list of sources, and so forth.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You want your
            report to sound professional, so be sure to proofread
            every page. If possible, get someone who is unfamiliar with
            the
            information to read and comment on your work. It's always a
            good idea
            to choose a reviewer with a similar background to your
            readers so that
            he or she can ask appropriate questions and provide useful
            comments to
            improve your report.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">After you
            have all the information written and edited, work on
            making your report visually appealing. You can add color and
            graphics
            by incorporating your company logo, using colored borders,
            and
            selecting custom bullet points and fonts. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Do you feel
            less intimidated now that you understand what is
            involved in writing a report? You should also know that you
            don't need
            to start your report writing project by staring at a blank
            page. You
            can find quite a few types of reports on the internet to see
            what
            others have done. For annual reports, you can request
            several from
            organizations similar to yours to see what they've
            published. </font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Starting with
            a pre-designed template package such as a proposal kit
            can give you a big boost with samples and with all the
            contents of your
            report. Content librarys such as those in a proposal kit
            contain sample
            reports, as well as hundreds of topic templates for all the
            sections
            you'll want to include in your report, including financial
            data. </font></big></big></p>

            suggestions about the types of information to include on
            each page.
            Kits contain not only all the templates you'll need for your
