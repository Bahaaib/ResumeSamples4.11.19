    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Having
            written all of these kinds of reports, and quite a few
            others, for multifarious clients, I know as you do that
            there is a big difference between most of them. I also know
            that - thankfully - there are templates of a sort for
            putting together, say, an annual report giving the financial
            and corporate results of a company, as against a written
            report supporting board decision-making about the advantages
            of buying one chain of restaurants over another.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So are there
            principles that all reports share?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Yes and no.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Yes, in that
            all reports require a lot of clear thinking about content
            and structure; the first to ensure clarity, the second to
            ensure ease of reference.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">No, in that
            the content, structure, style of writing and purpose can
            differ so wildly between types of report that they may as
            well be different animals, or hail from different planets.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I would like
            to look at the 'yes' side of the above answer and offer some
            observations on how we should think about content and
            structure.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So how do I
            assemble ideas about content?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The answer is
            to marshal your thoughts. And the way you do this is to
            start with a question. The question is "What do I want to
            achieve?" The more complex the nature of the thing you are
            writing, the more levels there will be to the answer.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So, take a
            piece of paper and write down all the answers you can think
            of - and if you are working with colleagues, so much the
            better, they will definitely help by adding more answers.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Sometimes the
            answer is simple - or there is one dominant answer, for
            example:</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <br>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">To provide
          information to enable decision-making <br>
          <br>
          To show company results <br>
          <br>
          To influence the board to go ahead with this project <br>
          <br>
          To sell more products or services to this or that target
          audience <br>
          <br>
          To explain implications of this or that strategy to the main
          board <br>
          <br>
          To show how to clear a path through these obstacles <br>
          To explain how we can make more profit while reducing <br>
          costs, increasing customer numbers and maintaining levels of
          employment for the next year.</font></big></big><br>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You notice
            that the last one just started to get a little more than
            simple because there were a number of layers to it. Never
            mind, what is important here is that your report effectively
            hangs upon one or more propositions about what you want to
            achieve. It's your report and you are clear about the
            desired outcome - so this is the peg upon which you hang
            your content.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Sometimes the
            answer is more complicated. Part of the reason for this is
            that you don't really know what the priorities are. You have
            been asked to do something which is causing you a headache
            and even with the help of colleagues you are a little
            unsettled about what the real objective of your report is.
            In this case:</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you are in
            a position to get further clarification from someone who
            seriously does know, or appears to know the answer, do so
            now. Choose three or four of the main reasons why you think
            the report is being asked of you and then ask the question:
            "Can you identify the biggest priority - or have I not
            covered the field?"</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you are
            not in this position but you have to 'wing it' - a position
            occupied by many otherwise over-busy people in all kinds of
            organisation - set out to write the shortest possible report
            covering the most obvious reasons for writing it.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">For the time
            being, at least, stick to your guns and put your objective
            or objectives for writing the report clearly at the top of
            the piece of A4 paper. Do not - please do not - at this
            stage think you have enough to get you started directly on
            the computer.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This is just
            a mapping exercise. You might not look at this bit of paper
            more than once when you do actually put your report
            together, but believe me this bit of scribbling will set the
            right direction of travel and save you some frustrating
            hours tangling yourself in niceties you don't need to think
            about.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Of vital
            importance, realise that the thing that you've just written
            down about what you want to achieve by writing this report
            is seldom the same as the bit in so many reports that calls
            itself 'Objectives of this report'. I'll unfold this a
            little. The thing you want to achieve may be "to influence
            the board to go ahead with this project" but your
            'Objectives of this report' will certainly not explicitly
            state your desire to influence the board to do anything.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The report's
            'objectives' are, let's say, to lay out and to explain
            aspects of the projects costs, feasibility, implications on
            company strategy, perceived obstacles and ways of overcoming
            them... and other stuff, so that the board can make a
            decision. If you write an intelligently constructed report,
            the Board will not only make the decision you want but will
            congratulate itself for doing so - and probably ignore you
            for stating the obvious so clearly. Never mind that. You
            never wrote 'I want to impress the board and be recognised
            for doing this so brilliantly' as your foremost objective.
            On the other hand, one person or two on the main board might
            just notice the clarity of the report and how the right
            pieces seemed to have assembled themselves with distinction.
            This may do you some good.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">What comes
            next? Yes, of course, the content itself.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">We are still
            on the mapping exercise so scribble down some of the subject
            areas you wish to cover - all of which support your
            objective as written down at the top of the paper. Don't go
            into details about each section yet - see if you can do this
            with just a few headings and some doodles. If you are doing
            this in a group, you'll quickly fill the page and make clear
            what the key areas are.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now you can
            assemble your priorities. What comes first? What's most
            important? You'll realise that some sections of content are
            actually subsets of others so you can group those
            accordingly. You'll also notice - depending on the nature of
            the report - that you have more detail than you require, for
            example supporting data and metrics, or other reports or
            letters that have informed your thinking or that you wish
            the audience to take into account. These will probably be
            best placed in the appendices - more on that later.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As you
            assemble outline content you may find that the list of
            content - once tidied up a little - is almost looking like a
            structure for the report. But be careful here. You do not
            necessarily want to put your most important content first
            because it might require supporting arguments which can only
            be set out by including some of the other content
            beforehand. Imagine you are telling a story, a narrative, in
            a way that not only holds the audience but which enables
            them to judge where you are going. But you are not aiming to
            thrill your audience, diving and weaving between plot and
            character to make them second guess you. You want them close
            all the time - your job is clear explanation. So look for a
            logical sequence. This is normally a three-stage process
            depending on each area of content: scene-setting; current
            position including options, pitfalls and opportunities; and
            solutions or indications of the most appropriate way
            forward.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As a pointer
            about content - if you are using the report to persuade or
            influence be very careful about assumptions. If you make
            them and don't qualify them, they'll be spotted quickly and
            this often discounts the base of genuine evidence you are
            building up in the report to support your argument or to
            provide an explanation of a circumstance or situation. If
            you are looking at something a little nebulous like market
            trends and forecasts, do state clearly that these are
            assumptions and be very careful, if at all possible, to
            qualify and explain where and how you obtained these types
            of information - and choose credible sources. Do not base
            your argument half on assumptions and half on reasonably
            ascertainable fact - you want as much of the latter as
            possible and as little of the former.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">A good rule
            is that assumptions and forecasts are generally wrong. But
            don't follow that rule too closely otherwise you'll decide
            that nothing is ever worth doing because, who knows, we may
            all be dead from a cataclysmic event tomorrow or next month.
            If we are making and selling energy efficient cars, we have
            to assume that there are people out there who want to drive
            them and will continue to do so. But if we are basing our
            reformed business model on the assumption that China will
            have at least 8 per cent growth per year for the next
            fifteen years, or that we will live in an entirely bookless
            world within a decade, we are unlikely to achieve our aim of
            influencing the board's decision.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So focus your
            content on the doable and the knowable and leave aside the
            distractions from these arguments. On the other hand if your
            report is entirely about possible future trends affecting
            local, regional and global markets, you can have a field
            day... but put your best-shot assumptions in a line of
            priority.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">As an
            ancillary point of the same kind, do not write what you
            perceive your intended audience already believe or what you
            think they want to hear. That will be your perception and
            you may not have the wisdom or experience of your audience,
            or you may not be as stupid as them. Trying to gauge
            people's emotional response to your ideas is not a good way
            of creating, prioritising or embellishing the content of a
            report. <br>
          </font></big></big></p>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Write what
            you know.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">What about
            structure?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You have a
            list of prioritised content on your paper, and you have
            subset information. The task now is to get the ducks in
            order - you need a series of headings that do justice to the
            main sections of content you have decided upon.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">So think very
            carefully about the content headings you have written down
            and make sure the headings don't overlap. For example, you
            might have written down 'sales teams' and also 'recruitment
            needs'; and you may have written down sales overseas' and
            also 'leading product lines'. Let's say you are looking at
            the current progress of the sales of five product lines in
            12 different countries. Is it best to look at this progress
            country by country or product by product? Which way will
            lead us to the telling information most quickly and
            effectively? Which is going to involve the least amount of
            duplication? If the trading situation affecting sales in
            each country is the main thing of interest then you will
            probably need 12 sub-headings under 'sales progress', one
            for each country. If it is purely about product line
            popularity and demand for each line, it is probably easiest
            to lead with five sub-headings representing the product
            lines.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Once you've
            sorted that out, you might want to think about whether you
            place your information on sales teams and recruitment needs
            as one section heading and then you might wonder whether you
            place this before or after the section on product
            lines/countries... and so on. The point is, do the thinking
            now rather than allowing yourself to be tied into knots when
            you commit to writing on screen.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Gradually the
            scribble becomes a road map. Make a slightly neater written
            copy as a guide taking only two-thirds of the page from the
            left margin. In the right margin area make notes about your
            sources. You may need information from a letter, a
            colleague, other reports or another document. Write down
            what you need next to the proposed subject headings.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now you can
            move to the computer... and you will be ready to start
