          Report writing is a time consuming business so it is a great
          shame if, having devoted all that time to writing your report,
          the quality is such that hardly anyone can be bothered to read
          it. Quite frankly, most report readers do not actually read
          all the report; they are too short of time. You might as well
          know it and accept it -- that is normal. They only read the
          parts that interest them. Frequently these are the summary,
          the conclusions and recommendations.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, some readers do need all the details you so
          carefully included, they are specialists, but most do not.
          Most readers just need two things: that the information they
          want is where they expect it to be so they can find it, and
          that it is written clearly so that they can understand it. <br>
          <br>
          It is similar to reading a newspaper. You expect the news
          headlines to be on the front page; the sports coverage to be
          at the back; the TV listings on page whatever and the
          editorial comment in the middle. If what you want is not in
          its usual place then you have to hunt for it and you may get
          irritated. So it is with a report. <br>
          <br>
          There is a convention as to what goes where. Stick with the
          convention and please your readers. Break the convention and
          people may get slightly irritated - and bin your report.<br>
          <br>
          So what is that convention, the standard format?<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Standard Sections</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b><br>
          </b><b>Title Section.</b> In a short report this may simply be
          the front cover. In a long one it could also include Terms of
          Reference, Table of Contents and so on.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Summary.</b> Give a clear and very concise account of the
          main points, main conclusions and main recommendations. Keep
          it very short, a few percent of the total length. Some people,
          especially senior managers, may not read anything else so
          write as if it were a stand-alone document. It isn't but for
          some people it might as well be. Keep it brief and free from
          jargon so that anyone can understand it and get the main
          points. Write it last, but do not copy and paste from the
          report itself; that rarely works well.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Introduction.</b> This is the first part of the report
          proper. Use it to paint the background to 'the problem' and to
          show the reader why the report is important to them. Give your
          terms of reference (if not in the Title Section) and explain
          how the details that follow are arranged. Write it in plain
          English.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Main Body. </b>This is the heart of your report, the
          facts. It will probably have several sections or sub-sections
          each with its own subtitle. It is unique to your report and
          will describe what you discovered about 'the problem'. <br>
          <br>
          These sections are most likely to be read by experts so you
          can use some appropriate jargon but explain it as you
          introduce it. Arrange the information logically, normally
          putting things in order of priority -- most important first.
          In fact, follow that advice in every section of your report.<br>
          <br>
          You may choose to include a Discussion in which you explain
          the significance of your findings.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Conclusions.</b> Present the logical conclusions of
          your investigation of 'the problem'. Bring it all together and
          maybe offer options for the way forward. Many people will read
          this section. Write it in plain English. If you have included
          a discussion then this section may be quite short.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Recommendations. </b>What do you suggest should be done?
          Don't be shy; you did the work so state your recommendations
          in order of priority, and in plain English. <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Appendices. </b>Put the heavy details here, the
          information that only specialists are likely to want to see.
          As a guide, if some detail is essential to your argument then
          include it in the main body, if it merely supports the
          argument then it could go in an appendix.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Conclusions and Recommendations</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          In conclusion, remember that readers expect certain
          information to be in certain places. They do not expect to
          hunt for what they want and the harder you make it for them
          the more likely they are to toss you report to one side and
          ignore it. So what should you do?<br>
          <br>
          1. Follow the generally accepted format for a report: Summary,
          Introduction, Main Body, Conclusions, Recommendations and
          Appendices. <br>
          <br>
          2. Organise your information in each section in a logical
          fashion with the reader in mind, usually putting things in
          order of priority - most important first.<br>
          <br>
          Good luck with your report writing!<br>
