<body><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Chapter 3</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Healthy Nutrition And Its Benefits </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
would have heard lots of people saying that healthy nutrition is
important for a healthy body but you need to know what is the actual
meaning of healthy nutrition and why it is so important. Let&#8217;s define
nutrition. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;Nutrition
is the process of giving your body all the important and necessary
elements which can help it to grow in a proper and balanced way.&#8221; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
is the simplest definition of nutrition which tells you that you need
to eat proper food with good basic nutrients. Healthy nutrition can
make your body strong and healthy also it can help it to grow and
repair itself while an unhealthy nutrition plan can make your body
weaker and can make you ill and you will not be able to fight against
certain minor diseases. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Calories In - Calories Out</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Everyone
who wants to lose weight has probably tried multiple diets, supplements
and/or plans.&nbsp; There are hundreds of weight loss methods available
to buy.&nbsp; All of them making wild promises.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Here
is the hard truth - there are no magical pills, diets or exercise
gadgets that will make weight instantly disappear.&nbsp; It comes down
to eating right, staying healthy and burning more calories than you
take in. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">That
is where the saying &#8220;calories in - calories out&#8221; comes from.&nbsp; You
want to make sure you burn more calories (out) than you consume (in).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Clearly,
this is a simplistic view and a proper diet consists of taking more
than calories into consideration.&nbsp; We will look at that in other
chapters, but right now we want to talk about creating a calorie
deficit.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
order to track this you need some basic information.&nbsp; First off
you need to figure out how many calories you burn per day naturally.
This comes down to factors such as age and weight. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Calculating the Number of Calories You Burn Daily</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR calculation for men (kg)</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR = 66.5 + ( 13.75 x weight in kg ) + ( 5.003 x height in cm ) &#8211; ( 6.755 x age in years )</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR calculation for men (pounds)</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR = 66 + ( 6.23 x weight in pounds ) + ( 12.7 x height in inches ) &#8211; ( 6.76 x age in years )</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR calculation for women (kg)</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR = 655.1 + ( 9.563 x weight in kg ) + ( 1.850 x height in cm ) &#8211; ( 4.676 x age in years )</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR ca lculation for women (pounds)</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BMR = 655 + ( 4.35 x weight in pounds ) + ( 4.7 x height in inches ) &#8211; ( 4.7 x age in years )</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
formula will give you the basic calories you burn daily, just by
breathing, heart pumping and etc...&nbsp; These are how many calories
you burn if you didn&#8217;t move all day (basal metabolic rate).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Once
you have that number, you need to start tracking the calories you burn
and the calories you consume.&nbsp; This can be tricky because it is a
lot of information to keep track of. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are websites that can help though:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a href="http://caloriecount.about.com/"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">http://caloriecount.about.com/</span></a><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
is one of the more popular calorie counters out there since it is
free.&nbsp; It will help you track what you eat, and what you
expend.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
just have to enter the foods and activity you had for the day.&nbsp; It
will even allow you to input your basal metabolic rate.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It
is ideal if you can keep a daily caloric deficit, but that isn&#8217;t always
possible.&nbsp; Sometimes we slip and sometimes we indulge.&nbsp; If
you can get a weekly caloric deficit that will still have you losing
weight.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
isn&#8217;t about starving yourself, or exercising until you are dead.&nbsp;
It is all about being aware what you put in your body, and what you
exert.&nbsp; Weight loss can be a struggle, but if you can manage your
calories in and calories out - you can overcome! </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Clean Eating</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">We
have talked about calories in calories out - the basic weight loss
guideline.&nbsp; It is a basic tip because you still want to make sure
you are getting those calories from good sources.&nbsp; Keeping your
calories down by eating two corn-dogs a day probably isn&#8217;t your best
choice.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Eating clean is a term that doesn&#8217;t have an official term but in general it means:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;Eating healthy whole foods while avoiding processed foods and refined sugars&#8221;.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">That
is a general goal to strive for, it isn&#8217;t always possible to eat
completely &#8220;clean&#8221; but if you are getting the majority of your calories
from clean sources then you are doing great.&nbsp; When you eat clean
you avoid processed foods so automatically things like fast food and
junk food are eliminated from your diet.&nbsp; If you do eat some
processed food don&#8217;t fret over it, the idea is to eat leanly as much as
possible.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Here are some general clean eating tips:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8226;&nbsp; Learn to read labels!&nbsp; Read the nutritional information
and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ingredients of everything you buy. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8226;&nbsp; Choose while grains when possible.&nbsp; Whole wheat
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't necessarily mean &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole
grain either!&nbsp; Look for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bread, pasta and etc...
that are made with 100% &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
grains</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp; Eat lots of fruits and vegetables.&nbsp; They are great whole &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sources of clean calories</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8226;&nbsp; Prepare more of your own meals, don&#8217;t eat out as much
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or buy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; microwaveable type
meals.&nbsp; These meals even &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when &#8220;healthy&#8221;, can be
loaded &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with things like sodium.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8226;&nbsp; Choose lean meats when cooking.&nbsp; Eating meat is fine
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the protein will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help build
muscle and make you feel full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chicken and fish are
great meat &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; choices.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp; Avoid processed meats like bologna or hot dogs.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp; Replace junk food with unsalted or lightly salted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whole nuts.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226;&nbsp; Check out the internet for great clean recipes.&nbsp; Keep a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; list!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8226;&nbsp; Don&#8217;t fret over falling off the wagon, even grat yourself
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cheat day now and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8226;&nbsp; Eating clean while out can be tough but more &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
restaurants are offering clean &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; menu items.&nbsp; A
Salad &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can be a good choice, but if you are really
hungry you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; need to add some
protein!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8226; Start as soon as possible!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Eating
clean is a great way to make sure you not only lose weight but you are
overall healthy.&nbsp; It isn&#8217;t necessarily an easy transition and you
don&#8217;t have to try and turn on a switch and do it overnight.&nbsp; If
you are committed to losing weight and being healthy, you should choose
to clean up your diet.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Reducing Your Portions!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Anyone
who is trying to lose weight needs to consider their portion
control.&nbsp; Just talk to anyone who has actually lost weight (and
sustained it).&nbsp; They will almost assuredly bring up portion
control as one of the keys for their success.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What is Portion Control?</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Portion control is understanding how much a serving size is and how many calories a serving contains.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One
of the biggest problems overweight people face is realizing what
constitutes a proper portion of food.&nbsp; When you eat a meal you
need to realize what constitutes a serving size of your foods.&nbsp;
While not scientific, the following list gives you an idea of some
recommended portion sizes.&nbsp; If you struggle with weight loss,
these portions might seem smaller than you thought:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;&nbsp; Vegetables or fruit is about the size of your fist.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;&nbsp; Pasta is about the size of one scoop of ice cream.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;&nbsp; Meat, fish, or poultry is the size of a deck of cards or the size &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of your palm (minus the fingers).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;&nbsp; Snacks such as pretzels and nuts are about the size of a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cupped handful.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;&nbsp; Potato is the size of a computer mouse.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;&nbsp; Steamed rice is the size of a cupcake wrapper.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;&nbsp; Cheese is the size of a pair of dice or the size of your whole &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thumb (from the tip to the base).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I
know personally that the cheese serving size surprised me when I first
saw it.&nbsp; You can find portion information online.&nbsp; You can
find much more specific portion control guides online as well.&nbsp;
Some sites will break it down by food weight, so you may need to weight
your food for exact portions.&nbsp; The above list though is good
enough to give you a rough idea. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you eat a meal, control your portions!&nbsp; Learning how much food you
actually need is one of the biggest steps you will take on your weight
loss journey. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Spreading
out meals into smaller portions as opposed to eating enormous meals at
any one time is a major factor in losing weight. It's been proven that
rationing your meals not only reduces your caloric intake throughout
the day but it also helps to steady your metabolism. If you're in the
habit of eating 2-3 massive meals daily, consider eating 6-7 smaller
meals which are spread out throughout your day.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One
thing people enjoy doing is eating right from the packet as opposed to
taking out what they need and putting the packet away. Such an example
is eating out of a mega-sized packet of potato chips. Not only do you
have no idea how much you are consuming, but typically you're
satisfying a craving by eating more than you really need until you are
completely satisfied when instead you could pour a small portion into a
bowl and add a piece of fruit to get the amount of food you actually
need.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Super-sized
packets are more commonplace now than before. More items are sold in
bulk and more foods are served at restaurants with the option to
supersize for a few extra cents. Increased portions are a factor in the
rising statistics for obesity. There is always a cause but people put
enjoyment ahead of anything else which naturally leads to a health
risk. This is why rationing meals are a handy way to take control of
your bad habits. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It
takes discipline to make adjustments and there's really no reason why
people must feel they should eat until they're full. As always, tiny
servings are fine and if still peckish, add a tiny bit more as opposed
to loading your plate and trying to finish it all. Rather than sit
around feeling stuffed and undoing your belt buckle, leaving some room
so that you can have another small meal a few hours later while still
feeling good enough to mix in a little bit of exercise is a good
balance which leads to improved results.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Doing
this helps control the weight and slowly it begins to come down which
is a marvellous feeling when you experience it, motivating you to work
a little harder as you become confident in your ability to take control
of your own body as opposed to allowing your cravings to take control
for you.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Water Is Your Best Friend</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It's
been suggested by research that you require at least 8 glasses of water
daily, but it can depend on your weight regarding how much you actually
require. You would need to divide your weight by 2 so as an example, a
man weighing 180lbs would need 60 ounces of water in a day.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So why do experts suggest that we drink lots of water and why is it considered so essential to a healthy life? </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Well
first off it helps to avoid dehydration and it keeps the kidneys
functioning well by assisting in the elimination of waste products plus
it helps to increase your metabolism which helps you to lose weight.
But aside from listening to what experts tell you, you should make it a
priority to listen to your body first and foremost. When you are
thirsty, then naturally you will drink water to replenish yourself. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Depending
on the kind of work that you do, you should try to get into the habit
of drinking water regularly or even better, keeping</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">a
water bottle handy, especially on really hot days since the heat causes
you to sweat and your body loses water and thus you will need to
replenish yourself.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
is why water is so important in our lives. Not only is it zero
calories, it is the best source for quenching your thirst AND the
healthiest. You may consider adding water to all of your meals over
time and doing away with fruit drinks and sodas ultimately as it will
help reduce your caloric intake and you'll also feel much better
without the added sugar that comes with the other drinks</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></body></html>
