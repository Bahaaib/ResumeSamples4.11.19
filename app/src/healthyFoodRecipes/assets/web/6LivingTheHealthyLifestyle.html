<body><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Chapter 5</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Living The Healthy Lifestyle</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Once
you have reached your target weight, you&#8217;ll want to know how to
maintain it so you don&#8217;t put all that hard work to waste! Educating
yourself ahead of time will help you when you are at the point where
you have attained your weight loss goal. You wouldn&#8217;t want to ruin the
celebration you will want to have, and you of course want to continue
on with your newfound healthy lifestyle. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Don&#8217;t skip any meals! Remember, your body&#8217;s metabolism will take this
as a signal that your body is starving and will begin to store fat for
reserves. Make sure you keep up with eating your meals, scheduled out
as you have been. Besides, if you skip a meal at one point in the day,
it could mean you overeat later on when you are just so hungry. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Keep eating a variety of foods. This will help you to keep getting all
the nutrients and vitamins your body needs to stay working properly. It
will keep you feeling healthy, energized and protect your body by
keeping it healthy. You can include choices from whole grains, fruits,
vegetables and lean proteins. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Keep up the exercising! Don&#8217;t get lazy and slack off on your exercise
routine now. You have gained the knowledge of what kind of a workout is
right for you, and probably how to change it up every once in a while
as well if you had instruction from a personal trainer. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Changing
up your routine is a great idea to keep you from getting bored, and to
keep your body guessing. As long as you are always combining your
cardio and strength training, you will continue to stay fit and feel
strong and healthy, all while protecting yourself further from
illnesses coupled with your healthy diet. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Adjust your daily caloric intake. Many people wonder if they should
increase their daily caloric intake right away. It is probably
advisable to do so, but do so gradually. Try starting with just 250
calories more a day. After a week, weigh yourself. You&#8217;ll probably
still have lost some more weight. If this is the case, add another 250
calories, then weight yourself a week after that. Repeat these steps
until you see that your weight has remained the same when you weigh
yourself for the week. If you gained a bit, take away some calories,
100 at a time, until your weight evens out and remains the same from
week to week. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Keep drinking that water! Don&#8217;t forget to have at least eight glasses
of water a day to keep your body working well. Water aides in
digestion, increases your energy and helps rid your body of toxins
naturally. Plus, you will stay hydrated and healthy. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Keep eating frequently. Eating five to six small meals a day as you
have probably already learned to do is a good thing to continue doing,
as this keeps your metabolism up, and keeps you feeling satisfied. It
is important to continue this as well because you don&#8217;t want to fall
into the trap of increasing your portion sizes again if this was a
problem before. You will throw yourself all the way back to square one
eventually. In the very least, you will gain a bunch of the weight back
you worked so hard to shed. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Don&#8217;t let the junk food back in. Now that you&#8217;ve developed your healthy
habits, why ruin it by going back to your old ways and eating junk
food? You have discovered plenty of delicious tastes to satisfy all
your cravings with healthy foods. Keep your intake of fruits and
vegetables up to several servings a day, preferably 6-8. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Take your daily vitamins. Remember to keep taking your daily vitamins
as well. Doing this will help assure that you acquire all the vitamins
you need each day and it will help you to maintain your healthy weight
as well. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">The Secrets of Staying Healthy </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Everybody
wants to live long and healthy lives; nobody wants to count on getting
any severe diseases. Although we can&#8217;t predict or prevent every
situation, there are ways to help protect ourselves that can make our
lives more full and healthy overall. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Prevention and early detection is the first thing you should consider.
Most people dread going for a yearly physical, or even the dentist
cleaning every six months, but having good doctors and keeping these
appointments in your life will help you to stay healthy because you
doctor can detect things that you can&#8217;t on your own. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Knowing
your family history is also important because if there is any history
of heart disease or cancers in your family your doctor can keep any eye
out for symptoms and do testing on you regularly. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Love the people you are with. Make sure and spend time with the ones
who surround you daily such as your spouse, children, other family
members, friends and coworkers. Enjoy the time you spend with other
people, plus maintain healthy friendships. These relationships are
needed to make you feel fulfilled in life. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Get eight hours of sleep. Although many people find this one difficult
to do because of how busy we can get in our lives, it really is very
important to leading a happy and healthy life. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Find something you are good at. All of us have times where we need to
be doing something we really enjoy, and most of these are things that
we excel at. This is usually something that makes us feel good inside
as well, and can even be soothing and stress relieving. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Manage your stress &#8211; don&#8217;t ignore it! Everyone has stressors of some
kind, and it is important that we handle our stress so that it does not
get out of hand and consume us. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you are riddled with worry and stress it can literally make you sick in
many different ways. Daily walks can help clear your head, and make
sure that you arenot over-filling your agenda for each day or letting
other&#8217;s schedules dictate your day. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Find balance in your life. Don&#8217;t try to take on too many projects at
work or let work consume you. Find a balance so you are still able to
enjoy all the other things around you like your hobbies and your
friends and family. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Although
financial times can be tough, it is still so very important to find
time to spend at least with your family, the ones you are working so
hard to keep safe and provided for. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">The Advantages of Staying Healthy </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
benefits of staying healthy are boundless. It doesn&#8217;t just mean that
you are happy with the way you look and can fit into that new outfit.
Being healthy has to do with your whole physical, mental and social
well-being. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Your Physical Health: Keeping yourself physically healthy can help you
all around. Not only can it help you to take part in daily activities
such as being able to walk, move and bend, but it allows you to be
physically able to take care of your loved ones around you who depend
on you. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It can be financially beneficial if you avoid diseases that were preventable and that would be very costly. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Your Mental Health: If you do not have a good mental health, your
physical health will also be affected. Many people don&#8217;t realize just
how important their mental health is to their overall well-being. If
you allow yourself to be over-stressed or for that stress to rule your
life, it can make you sick. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Stress
can raise your blood pressure which increases your risk of a heart
attack or stroke. You need to deal with your stress in positive ways
like through exercise, meditation or therapy. Don&#8217;t deal with stress by
things that can damage your overall health like smoking, drinking or
eating unhealthy foods. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Disease Prevention: Making sure you are eating a healthy diet is vital
to your overall health and staying healthy. The foods you choose to eat
can have a direct impact on your health. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Phytochemicals
are important for your health and could prevent things like heart
disease, specific types of cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure.
They are found only found in certain foods like berries, spinach,
olives and kale. Eat a low-fat diet full of lots of fruits and
vegetables plus whole grains to help protect your cardiovascular
health. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Long Life: Striving to live a healthy lifestyle can be a big factor of
you being able to live a long and healthy life. Although you can&#8217;t
prevent all health </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">problems and some of them are out of your control, a lot of the most significant ones you can help to avoid by living healthy. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">With
the leading causes of death being chronic diseases such as diabetes,
heart disease, stroke and cancer, having lifestyle choices that include
controlling the foods you eat, keeping your weight at a healthy level,
how much you exercise and how you deal with the stressors in your life
can have a huge impact on keeping these diseases at bay. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Living
a healthy lifestyle can also improve your mood and give you greater
self-esteem and mental focus. You will be stronger, have a higher
stamina and you will be able to get a better night&#8217;s sleep. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Other
benefits of a healthy lifestyle include improved digestion and a lower
blood pressure. Keeping yourself healthy can also help ease or
eliminate back problems and back pain plus improve your posture,
enhance coordination and balance, and lower your resting heart rate. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Conclusion</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Ready&#8230;Set&#8230;Go!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now
that we've learnt how to change your lifestlye and lose weight now,
everybody knows what to do. They read the material, they realize they
need to take action and put in the effort but the truth of the matter
is, people seldom do. Unless you discipline yourself to resist the
temptation of eating unhealthy foods and motivate yourself to eat
healthy foods, you will find it difficult to get on the road to a
healthy life.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">No
amount of reading or saying "Yes, I can do it" will help you unless you
take that first step. It takes a strong commitment to get on track and
it takes an equally strong commitment to keep at it. Most people give
up after a short time because they're not satisfied with their results.
If you can commit and keep yourself motivated and continue to aspire to
eat well and train well, you will achieve your goal. No matter what the
goal is, be it to lose weight or increase your endurance or become a
better athlete in a specific sport, you just need to go out there and
make the effort and do the work required.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Over
the course of time, not only will you mentally adjust to your training
regiment but you will develop a great amount of discipline and
self-confidence and you will naturally maintain a positive attitude
which means easily being able to resist any kind of temptation.
Everybody needs to start from somewhere. Setting your goals little by
little as opposed to attempting to go all-out and trying to sweat out
10 pounds on the treadmill in the course of a week will do more harm
than good. Starting the process slowly is key which means going for a
brisk walk to help acclimate your body to the more rigorous runs you
plan to do in the later weeks.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One
mistake people make when starting out is going all out which leads to
injury and soon they decide that training is just too painful and
taxing. As before, set a schedule and if necessary, consult with a
personal trainer about what might be good for you if you feel
uncomfortable coming up with a schedule. Although you do not need to
make the process so difficult. If your desire is to lose weight, all
you really require is a small daily window allotted to your exercise
and keeping an eye on what you put in your body.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Simply
be confident and work towards your goals. Be positive and you will get
the results you want. Now is a good time to begin developing that plan
and taking a course of action so you can get on the road to the super
healthy lifestyle you deserve.</span> <br><br><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So, go do it!</span><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></body></html>
