the rush of our everyday lives, the advancement of technology, along
with the conveniences of fast food, it sure is hard to stay active and
eat a healthy, balanced diet. But if you know how to do it, it can be
done, even with a busy lifestyle. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In this first section of the book we are going to look at:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">All the reasons why we gain weight, </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The people we need to talk to when we decide we are ready to lose the weight, </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Why keeping yourself on a schedule actually helps you to lose the weight, </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Weight loss secrets, </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Plus many other subjects that will help you to learn how to finally take the weight off and keep it off once and for all </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The Major Causes Of Weight Gain</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">We
eat more calories than our body needs in a day, so the excess gets
stored as fat. Our human bodies are designed in such a way that when in
times it was harder to get food, our bodies could be prepared by having
stored extra calories in times of plenty in the form of fat. Now, with
the ease with which we get food, a lot of people tend to overeat, and
this is a severe problem that causes a huge number of people to become
overweight or obese. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Genetics play a factor as well by setting basic parameters on the
metabolic efficiency of your body. People who are overweight many times
have very efficient metabolisms, meaning their body needs less calories
per day than others to operate, and they store the excess calories as
fat. Also you have a greater risk of being obese if one of your parents
are and an even greater risk if both parents are.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Your metabolic rate. Besides genetics, your metabolic rate depends on
how active you are. It is said that every ten years past our
mid-twenties we lose about 10% of our metabolic rate. This probably
does not have to do completely with age, however, but instead with how
active we are. The more active we are, the more muscle mass we can
retain, or even build, and in turn the more fit we are because muscle
tissue is metabolically active whereas fat is not. On the other hand,
if we lead a basically sedentary life, we are much more likely to be
able to gain weight as we lose muscle mass.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Eating patterns. People&#8217;s eating habits make a huge difference in
determining their weight. When foods high in fat or sugars are favored,
this of course can cause much weight gain. Also, how you serve the
food, i.e. do you put the portions on everyone&#8217;s plate or do you bring
it all to the table and serve it the food family style where everyone
can take as much as they want? Portion size is one of the main reasons
people eat too much. Also, how have you learned to eat? If you are a
fast eater, you may not even realize the cues your stomach gives you
that it is full.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Larger portion sizes. Over time, larger portions of food have become
the norm, especially at many restaurants. Weight has also gone up
because of this. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Exercise or the lack thereof. Exercise is essential to a healthy
lifestyle and to maintaining a healthy weight. When you exercise,
especially when you include strength training in your workouts, you
gain muscle mass and raise your metabolism and in turn the muscle helps
to burn more fat. In turn, you will weigh less and you will look leaner
and firmer because muscle takes up less space than fat. Plus, strength
training helps reduce the risk of accidental injury, improves your bone
density, helps with digestion and helps in lowering your blood
pressure, cholesterol and triglyceride levels. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As
you can see, even if your genes make it easier to gain weight than
other people, diet and exercise are the two main factors that affect
your health and weight. Regular exercise is essential to getting to and
maintaining a healthy weight &#8211; and so is what you eat, how you eat and
how much you eat. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Learn
portion control. This is usually a huge factor for most people, and
they do not realize how much they are actually eating. A portion of
food the size of your fist is generally all that should be eaten at one
time, because that is the size of your stomach as well. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Eating
several small meals a day, rather than two or three big ones, will help
you to be able to eat less and also not be hungry in the early days of
forming this habit. Another vitally important thing is to never skip
breakfast, as this sets up your metabolism for the day. If you don&#8217;t
eat breakfast, your body will go into defense mode and store more fat
because it will think you are starving. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Try
slowing down your eating as well if you have the habit of eating fast.
This way you can feel the signals from your stomach when you have had
enough, before you stuff yourself full. When you have done that, you
know for sure you have eaten too much. In reality, on a scale of 1-10
of fullness, we should feel right in the middle, around a 5, when we
are done eating. It takes some practice, but you can learn this trick
and you will feel so much better knowing you did not stuff yourself to
the maximum capacity. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Another
thing to watch of course is your intake of fatty and sugary foods. We
all need nutrients, including healthy fats, to keep us balanced, but
eating a lot of junk food and sugary drinks will attribute greatly to
us gaining more weight. Processed foods don&#8217;t generally have a lot of
nutrients in them, or any at all, and they are high in salt, sugar, and
unhealthy fats. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
today&#8217;s busy lifestyles, we may not realize how often we are eating
these foods. If you are one who is always ordering out for work, or
going out to dinner as well, this is not going to keep you healthy
because you do not have the control as to what is being put in your
food (except special ordering at a restaurant) and it is much harder to
make sure you are eating the right kinds of things and getting all of
your nutrients. Going out to eat is fine every once in a while, but be
sensible in what you are choosing, and you don&#8217;t have to clear your
plate of the large servings you will most likely be given. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Should I Go On A Diet? </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
most people think of losing weight, they think of going on a diet. Many
times, this means finding some fad diet that is probably popular at the
current time, and trying to follow all of its crazy rules and recipes,
like lemon juice, cayenne pepper and maple syrup. But honestly, who
enjoys these things? Do you like cutting out entire food groups such as
carbohydrates or drinking crazy concoctions that simply do not taste
very good and do not fill you up? </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It
is doubtful that anyone does. Yes, there are other diet plans out there
that have a lot of merit to them, and if a diet is the way you want to
go, then researching the different ones out there is very advisable so
that you can find a reasonable, sensible diet plan that is not going to
harm you or make you go crazy with hunger, causing you to fail in the
end anyway. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Choosing the Right Diet Plan </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you are ready to choose your diet or eating plan, there are certain
things that you must take into consideration to make sure that you are
picking one that will help you to attain the weight loss goals you have
and to make sure you are staying healthy. Some diets, as we mentioned,
do not contain the right balance of nutrition that your body's needs,
and can therefore make you sick, and won&#8217;t help you to lose weight
properly. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Here are som important things to keep in mind when choosing the right diet plan:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Realistic Expectations: You must realize that losing weight is a
process and takes time.The length of time to achieve your goals depends
on how much you have to lose to bet to your goal weight. You do not
want to take on a crash diet plan that promises you to lose a lot of
weight in a short amount of time, as that will most likely be a very
unhealthy and an unsafe option for you. After the initial two or three
weeks when weight loss is rapid because of water loss, after that you
should be losing around 1-2 pounds a week to maintain healthy weight
loss.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
The Right Nutrition: Make sure you look over any diet plans you are
considering thoroughly and see what they allow or suggest for you to
eat. If it has a balanced-looking diet to it with the right amounts of
foods from the main food groups, you are probably looking at a plan
that is safe. Any of the fad diets that cut out whole food groups, or
make you starve yourself or drink strange concoctions are not safe. You
also want the right amount of protein, carbohydrates, fiber and make
sure you are getting no more than 30 percent of your calories from fat
per day.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
The Right Fit For You&#8230;or Not? While you are researching different diet
plans, make sure it is something that you think would suit you and your
lifestyle. If you are a very busy person who is not home a lot, look
for a plan that has convenience as well as healthy choices. If you wind
up choosing a plan that you don&#8217;t stick to for whatever reason, you
will wind up failing and you will then most likely go back to your old
ways, but now feeling worse than when you started out. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Calorie Level: Make sure that the plan you choose has you eating enough
calories. You essentially want to cut out enough calories so that you
can lose those 1-2 pounds a week. You have to weigh this all against
you and your activity levels, as how many calories you need each day
will vary from person to person depending on how active they are and
their weight. You might want to work with a trained health professional
to help you decide which is best for you. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How Diets Work</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Losing weight is simple; lose more calories than you can eat. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">We
eat because it is a necessity. The food we consume will be processed by
our body, breaking them down and only keeping what is needed while
throwing out the rest. As we do our normal daily tasks our body uses
calories and nutrients from our food as fuel for your body to complete
all the tasks. However our body only needs a certain amount of calories
to do this and this leads to all the unused calories being stored in
our body as fat. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
problem with our body is there is no way to tell it to stop storing
calories. All excess calories will be converted into fat no matter how
much fat you have in your body already. Most of us would always eat
more than we need to, taking in all those extra calories to lead us
into being overweight. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;So in essence a diet is supposed to help you lose those extra calories&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A
diet is an eating plan where you would control the amount of calories
eaten. Eating less is not the only way to diet. Since the goal is to
eat fewer calories, you can have constant food but it is low on
calories. So food like fruit or vegetables are low on calories if you
compare same amount with other food like meat.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you are dieting, you will be eating less than normal. So you would feel
hungrier throughout the day and feel more unsatisfied when you finish
your meal. It cannot be avoided since you are after all trying to lower
your calorie intake. Do not be mistaken with skipping meals or starving
yourself. Those will only worsen your diet conditions. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What
a good diet would include is help in suppressing the hunger, may it be
psychologically or physically. Diet will always prepare you
psychologically first before starting it. This is to ensure that you
will be able to keep on the diet plan for the whole duration and reach
your goal. Diet plans will also give you alternatives snacks that you
can eat to suppress your cravings.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you are on a diet, don't think that you will be having water and
vegetables to last for the whole day. Diet actually promotes eating a
balanced meal. You only want to have a lower calorie count but the rest
of the nutrients shouldn't be ignored.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So
when you are avoiding certain kind of foods, you would also be avoiding
their nutrients. So the diet plan will show you alternative food you
can take to replace the missing nutrients. Usually these foods are
avoided and not forbidden completely. So you can still eat them in
small portion once a while.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A
good diet also contributes to your natural metabolism. Each person has
his own rate of metabolism. A person with higher rate of metabolism
will be able to burn more calories a day. A proper diet plan can help
people with low metabolism to fully utilize them. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Like
having a proper breakfast to jump start the metabolism, lunch to keep
the energy going and eating less for dinner since you do not burn as
much calories at night. This is to ensure that you have enough calories
for the day.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Rule of Thumb</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you want to keep a diet plan, discipline is one of the most important
factors. Weight loss through proper diet will take from months to years
to achieve your proper weight. Diet that is extreme and promote speedy
result can turn into a form of yo-yo dieting. Yo-yo dieting is a term
where a person following a diet and manage to lose his weight but
eventually will eat and gain more than he lose. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
happens because the diet he followed was too extreme; limiting his food
intake and forbidding a lot of food category. So he cannot take all
these diet thus giving in and eating more. Or it can be due to the lack
of discipline after the targeted weight is achieved. This is usually
the cause when you go for extreme hyper caloric diet. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So
to avoid that, dieters are advised to go slow in their dieting where it
will take months to see big result and where majority will quit
halfway. It is not easy to change a habit you built up for years. So
that is why you need a lot of discipline, willpower and determination
to be able to stay on a diet.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Changing
a habit is hard at first. You must stick to your diet plan daily for
the first month. This will set the foundation. After 30 days it is said
you have formed a new habit</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">No
one has to diet alone. I truly encourage you to get a friend to help or
even diet with you. By having someone beside you for encouragement, you
can also slowly see the result in each other. It also helps to have
someone to confide in when you think that the diet is not working out
for you.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
you pick a diet to follow, you should consider a few diet plans that
might be similar to the one that you are already doing. This is to
diversify the diet. Following the same diet that you hate over and over
again will have a negative effect on your willpower later on. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
might even cause you to abandon your diet. So by diversifying your
diet, you will find a diet plan that you'll like and won't feel bored
watching what you eat. You can cycle diet plan by weekly or monthly,
making the diet eating plan fresh.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Just
remember if you have broken one of your diet meals, this does not mean
your whole day is ruined and you should not continue to follow your
diet plan for the rest of the day. Just continue your day as if you
never broken your diet in the first place. Over time this is what leads
to long term weight loss/management </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Industry Secrets </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There
are several things that the weight loss industry is not telling you &#8211;
nor do they want you to know. Their business is booming thanks to all
the fads, gadgets and pills out there that they are selling to people
desperate to lose weight. Unfortunately, the only thing in most cases
that is getting lighter is peoples&#8217; wallets. Many of these things do
not work, and only a small percentage of people buying into one of them
manage to lose the weight and keep it off. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Some of These Industry Secrets Include: </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Most weight loss product ads deceive the buyer. A majority of the
weight loss products you hear about on the radio and see on
infomercials don&#8217;t even do what they claim to. Even so, consumers are
lured into buying these products with promises like &#8220;Lose the weight
and keep it off&#8221;, &#8220;Eat whatever you want&#8221; and &#8220;no diet or exercise
required&#8221;. Basically, if it sounds too good to be true, it most likely
is. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Just because they say it&#8217;s &#8220;scientifically proven&#8221; or &#8220;doctor-endorsed&#8221;
doesn&#8217;t mean it works. These claims are typical as well, but they never
tell you anything about where the studies were made or by who so that
you can check out the validity for yourself. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">And
what does it really mean anyway? Often these so-called health
professionals have a financial interest in the product, and probably
did not review the scientific evidence. If it was reviewed, they may
not have even used acceptable review standards. Why would you want to
risk your health on such a thing? </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Just because the government allows a product to be on the market does
not mean it is safe for consumers or that it does what it claims. There
is a huge misconception that the government would not allow a product
on the market if it could potentially be harmful to you. People tend to
think that the government has to pre-approve them first, but many times
that is not the case. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Products toted as &#8216;natural&#8217; or &#8216;herbal&#8217; are not guaranteed safe. People
also assume that just because a product is made of natural ingredients
means it must be safe as well. But until the FDA receives evidence that
a product is harmful, the companies are free to put their products on
the market. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Not
everything you hear is true, and you shouldn&#8217;t believe it. There are
plenty of products that claim to do things that they just do not, and
you should steer away from products making high and lofty claims. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Don&#8217;t
buy into the claims of fad diets, either. Anything that requires sudden
and radical changes to your eating patterns is very difficult to
sustain over time. They will send you into a quick cycle of weight loss
which is always followed by a rebound period where you gain the weight
back and then some in certain instances once you&#8217;re normal eating
resumes. Plus, the next time you try to take the weight off, it makes
it all that much more difficult. There are no health benefits to these
diets, and if any one of them worked, do you really think there would
be the need for new ones? </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
also can not count on the money back guarantee. You have about as good
of a chance on getting your money back as having the product actually
do what it claims to. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There
is also no quick fix or magic pill that will help you to finally lose
weight. If the product is making such claims, you can just about
guarantee that they won&#8217;t work.. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></body></html>
