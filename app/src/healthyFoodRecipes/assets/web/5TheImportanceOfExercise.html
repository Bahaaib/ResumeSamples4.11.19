<body><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Chapter 4</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The Importance Of Exercise</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
this chapter, I will tell you about different types of exercises and
their effects on different aspects of your life and health. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Exercise to improve bone and muscle strength </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Flexibility increasing exercises </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Cardiovascular exercise </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Aerobics</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight: bold;">Exercising</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Exercising
and dieting are two things that go hand in hand. If you just diet
without exercising, you may not see any result at all because you are
not losing calories fast enough in your diet. Also if you do manage to
lose weight without dieting, you would look thin and frail as you lose
your fat. So it is better to exercise to keep your body fit while you
diet. There are also other reasons to exercise.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;A
recent survey showed that seven out of ten adults do not exercise
regularly and close to four out of ten are not physically active. If
you do not exercise, then you will risk getting stroke, diabetes and
heart disease. This has lead to death for about 300 000 people.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Before
you start exercising, you should consult a physician. This is to know
your current body condition and see if you would risk injuries if you
perform tiring exercise activities. When you first start out
exercising, do it slowly. First start off with only 10 minutes which
then is increase to 20 minutes then to 30 minutes and so on and so
forth over the period of months. This will help avoid your body to feel
very sore after each work out and decrease any injury risk.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
should at least do 30 minutes or more of moderate cardiovascular
activities each day. You do not have to do all 30 minutes together; it
can be even short bouts of intermittent activities. Then twice a week,
do exercise that would train your muscles. You can incorporate this
physical exercise into your daily life. For example, take the stairs to
the office instead of the elevator; go for a jog during your lunch time
or park further away from your work place. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If
you feel this is a too much of a chore, why not try to make your
leisure time more active. Instead of sitting at home only, ask your
family out for a bicycle ride, join a rock climbing club or just stroll
the park every evening.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Pick
out exercising activities that you would enjoy to do, find it
satisfying and gives you a feeling of accomplishment. A successful run
will motivate you more to be physically active. Make it easy for you to
be active by picking exercise that is easier accessible so you will not
be unmotivated every time you want to perform your exercise. Lastly,
pick out exercise that is compatible with your body and current age.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The 3 Main Types Of Exercise </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">First
of all, you need to know that there are three kinds of exercise plans
which are available and all four of them have different advantages for
your physical health. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Exercise To Improve Bone and Muscle Strength&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These
exercises are also called strength and resistance training. Most of the
people take body building as strength and resistance increasing
exercise but you need to know that body building is another category of
exercise in which the primary goal of the person is to enhance muscle
growth. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
can add some weight lifting and body building in your fat burning and
weight control plan but you should do it to an extent where your body
can bear it without any problem. If you over tried this exercise then,
your whole body can be a mess. I have seen people joining gyms and
doing hard exercise just by watching other people doing it. This is not
the way to go instead consult your trainer personally and ask him about
appropriate exercises which can fit in your needs. If your weight is
under control and you need just light exercise to keep your healthy
system going then, you do not need to lift heavy weights. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Flexibility Increasing Exercises </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Second
type of exercise plan can be to increase your flexibility and in more
common terms you can say that if you used to have pain in your arms,
legs, lower back, neck and other similar areas of your body then, you
need to make your body more flexible. Flexibility will increase
resistance and you will be able to cope with more difficult positions
and postures easily. You have to go through different postures in daily
life for example if you work in an office then, you can be given an
uncomfortable chair at times or you may be given some work in which you
have to concentrate hard on computer screen and you cannot rest your
back with chair. In these situations, if you do not have any
flexibility in your body then, it will create problems but regular
flexibility exercises which will not take more than 10-15 minutes of
your time, will increase this flexibility and will make you feel better
and active. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Cardiovascular Exercise </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Cardio
means heart and vascular means the vessels of blood and this whole
phrase means that these exercises improve the functionality of your
lungs and make the use of oxygen more effective and rectify any heart
problems which you can have. These exercises are little time consuming
and should be properly learned from your doctor or trainer. Most of the
times, people who already have got some heart problem perform these
kinds of exercises to avoid any future problems. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Finding Exercises To Be Done At Home</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A
major change has been observed in the tendency of workout freaks, which
is changing their exercise locale from gyms to home. Reason being, the
soaring membership prices and binding contracts. As a result, they have
started to opt for home fitness programs. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Finding
exercises to be done at home is not a complex job, rather a much more
convenient option. There are many great cardio exercises which can be
done without much cost to the users. The main money spent is in a good
pair of walking, jogging or aerobic shoe, depending on the kind of
activity desired. Besides, a jumping rope is also a great addition for
skipping at home because it provides users added alternatives of
aerobic workouts that can include rapid work interval training. One can
do it while watching TV or may be by playing music alongside. One
should jump for a duration of thirty seconds to a minute as fast as
possible and rest in between for sometime before starting again. You
can always perform it during ad commercials and watch the rest of your
show calming your body. Today, video and DVD market is flooded with</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">exercise, aerobics and yoga CDs and DVDs which can be purchased for a favorable fitness exercise regime to start at home.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
gives more alternatives to people in case jogging or walking becomes
mundane or if the weather does not allow you to go outside and run.
Running and walking can actually become all the more interesting if
done with a partner, provided no chit-chat and gossip hours begin and
win over your fitness schedule. '</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Varying
the ground of the running or walking area can also add change to the
daily workout process. Remember, it is very essential that you enjoy
what you do to keep yourself fit if you actually want to feel the
change in your health and body. Besides, age does matter while
selecting the kind of workout that you do. An adult person may be
capable of losing weight using particular equipments and build muscles
as well, but an elderly may not just get the</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">same
results from the same regimen. It is simply because of the quality of
performance and not the utilization the expensive and similar machines.
Thu, it&#8217;s advisable that you always choose a kind of fitness regimen
that goes well with your body, age and needs keeping the various health
constraints that age brings along. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Exercises that you can perform at home</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Leaving
you with no excuses of not finding the right type of exercises that you
can do at home, here is a list of the appropriate home fitness based
program exercises for you-</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">? These exercises can be performed by using easy drills at home and employing minimal</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">equipments which you can get from around your house.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">? For upper body you can do chair dips, lateral raises, push-ups, chin ups and bent</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">over row. For core exercises you can do dead lift, sit ups and Side Bridge.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">? For lower body you can opt for step ups, wall squat, bucket squats and lunges.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Prior
to starting these exercises you must warm up yourself for minimum of
five minutes by jogging or brisk walk around the block or by skipping
on the spot. You must perform multiple sets of the exercises mentioned
above depending upon your endurance level and requirement. Also, taking
intervals in between is equally essential. You can combine two
exercises that use diverse muscle groups alternating between two things
that provide each muscle group some rest while you perform another. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To
get the best results, perform these workouts at least three times a
week, with no less than a day between exercises for sufficient
recovery. You must always strive to increase the intensity or load and
to increase your fitness growth. Once your fitness improves, you can
undergo this routine without bothering much and start with a more
superior program. Use your creativity and find more things to use for
working out at home.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Using buckets, filled with the amount of water you want can be employed for squats and stepups.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Filling up milk bottles with 2 liter water makes it equivalent to a 2 kg weight to be used</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">for overhead triceps extension, bicep curls and bent over rows. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Shopping
bags and backpack filled with items can be used for lunges, stepups and
squats. Utilizing bricks by breaking them in half in case of lower
weight is appropriate for pushups, bench press, lateral raises and
front raise. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Then
comes the age old forms of exercises that come under the practice of
yoga asana. A lot of people not just perform these exercises for the
sole aim of relieving mental stress but to get and stay fit as well. If
you look at the fitness regimens of every famous celebrity today
including the big names like Jennifer Aniston, Drew Barrymore, it is
yoga that has worked wonders on their body to get the envious figure
every girl wants. Not only women, even men have also started
incorporating this form of fitness to build up muscles using their own
body weight. This is the most natural way of dealing with your body and
respecting it as well.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></body></html>
