make any diet a successful one, you need to be committed to it. Only
with a right mind set can you reach success. To prepare yourself, you
need to know what stage you are in before you can move on the next
stage of your diet. It might not be obvious but it is there.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
First stage is pre-contemplation. You do not see yourself as being over
weight. You do not feel like changing yourself. Only strong pressure
will lead you to seek help. But then you would resist and just be
demoralized as you see your own situation as hopeless.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Second
is contemplation. This is where you acknowledge that you have an over
weight problem and start to think of a solution. But you are not
willing to perform that solution. You would just brood over it, knowing
what actions to take to make a change but never ready to do so. You
will procrastinate about performing the solution.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Third
is preparation. You've finally decided to do something about your
overweight problem. You move on from brooding about your problem to
realizing your solution. You would also start to think about the future
where you are slimmer and feeling much healthier. But at this stage you
are not fully resolved yet. You would still have second thoughts about
the solution as it requires you to change your lifestyle.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Fourth
is action. You start to take action in losing weight. You would start
choosing the food you eat and do some form of exercise every day. It is
the first step in achieving your targeted goal.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
should always set goals when losing weight. If you don't set your
goals, then it's very possible that your whole dieting plan might not
go the way you imagine it.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;If you fail to plan, you plan to fail&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">List the following:</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What
is your current situation right now? List all your eating habits, food
preferences, everything that could affect your weight loss. Working
out, etc</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What
is the reason you want to lose weight? This could be an upcoming event,
summer, or even for a certain special someone. List the single BIGGEST
reason you can think of.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What
are the benefits you get from your weight loss? List AS MANY as you
can. It can be health, better energy, admired by partner, etc. This
should be your main motivator.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your
Goal. &#8220;I want to lose XX lbs of weight in XX days&#8221; - Write this in bold
and make it really sink in. I would personally say that setting a goal
of more than 10 lbs per 2 weeks is not realistic, especially if this is
your first attempt at a goal like this. Be realistic. You must write &#8220;I
want&#8221; not &#8220;I wish&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Write
everything down and look at that paper every day. Put it in a place
where you can see it. Once you see it every day, you will constantly be
reminded of WHY you do this and what the benefits are.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">BE PERSISTENT ONCE YOU TAKE ACTION BECAUSE IT&#8217;S NOT GOING TO BE EASY</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">STEPPING OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If
you see yourself making excuses rather than STARTING a diet that is
effective, you should think about why you don't really want to lose
weight. You must be able to step out of your comfort zone and as Nike's
famous slogan goes JUST DO IT!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
final step would be maintenance. You need to keep the momentum going
that you have in the action stage. If at anytime you lose your
commitment or support, then you would fall back to any of the previous
stages.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So
the final stage is the most important stage in your diet plan as you
need to keep your commitment going for a long period of time. There are
several methods you can use to keep being committed. First is to make a
list about the reason why are you doing this in the first place. Look
at the list daily to remind you of your goals. Do not have negative
thoughts in your mind. Words like "never" or "depriving" should not be
in your vocabulary. Rather than saying "never", you are just having
desserts "occasionally and in moderation". And so the word "deprived"
can be replaced with the word "choosing" as you choose to skip
chocolate cakes.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Visualize
in your mind your future slim self doing all the things that you always
wanted to do. This visualization will strengthen your motivation to
commit to this plan and be the desire to succeed. Do this visualization
daily, every time you wake up and anytime of the day you feel your
commitment is weakening.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Who to Approach When You Want to Lose Weight </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now
that you&#8217;ve decided you want to lose weight, you should include some
other people in your weight loss journey. These people can help you
with many aspects, including choosing your diet plan, setting your
goals and encouraging you along the way. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
A Therapist: Some people know they overeat, and how unhealthy it is for
them as well, yet can&#8217;t seem to stop their overeating no matter how
hard they try. Many of these people eat for emotional reasons like
loneliness or unhappiness and will try to hide their hurt and other
feelings with food. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">People
that do this should seek the council of a therapist or other
professionals trained in this specific matter so they can get the
proper support. In some severe cases, it will take checking themselves
into a specialized clinic designed for this purpose so that their&nbsp;
nutrition and exercise can be closely monitored.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
A Dietician: A dietician will have a wide range of knowledge that can
help you to understand your body and to help prepare a food plan that
will fit your particular needs, because in most states and countries it
is required to get a medical license before they can become a
dietician. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Their
goal is to help you eat healthier, and in turn you can lose weight.
Because of this, dieticians are set apart from anyone who promotes a
fad diet because they are not necessarily nutritionally sound for you.
A dietician will also help you to figure out how many calories you need
to consume in a day and to balance your intake of all the various food
groups that you should be eating from. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
A Physical Trainer: The majority of people have never learned to
exercise properly. A physical trainer will ensure that you do, and will
push you to attain your goals, and can also help in the process of
setting your goals. They will oversee your exercise routine in a gym,
giving you both cardio and strength based exercises to follow. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
main goal of a personal trainer is to see to it that you get fit, and
they also educate you on how to do that properly for yourself. Each
person is different in their needs, and a personal trainer can adjust
your training program to fit you just right. Over the course of the
weight loss process, both the physical trainer and the dietician may
give you advice in changing up your diet and your workout routine as
you begin to gain more muscle tone to help support your new muscles. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Friends and Family: When starting your weight loss journey, you may
want to let friends and family know what you are doing so that they can
be supportive of you. It always helps to have people you know and trust
that stand by your side in any endeavor. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
can even have a friend, or your spouse, keep you accountable to them
and stop you&nbsp; from sneaking any extra snacks or sweets, or to
motivate you to keep on your exercise regimen. You will likely be more
successful in the end if you have someone alongside you (even over the
phone if they are long distance) who will help encourage you when you
are reaching your goals and to help push you when you start to
struggle. Then, when you do reach your final goal (or even mini goals
throughout) you can celebrate your achievements with the ones you love.
</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Persisting Through Failure</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If
you want to commit to losing weight, then you need to be able to
persist through failure.&nbsp; Everyone who has accomplished something
of note has struggled with failure at one or more points in their
ascent.&nbsp; The difference is they didn't quit when it got tough,
persisted through it and learned a lesson.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;When the going gets tough, the tough get going&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Those are the two keys in dealing with failure.&nbsp; You must persist and learn.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If
you slip on your diet, or miss a day of exercise, don&#8217;t fret about
it.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t let it derail you.&nbsp; Push it from your mind.&nbsp;
Focus on all your positive days, not the one slip up.&nbsp; Remember it
is all about living a healthy lifestyle, the more good days add up and
before you know it bad days become few and far between. But the trick
is to keep going and push through the bad days. Treat it as a cheat day
and move on.&nbsp; This is how you persist, failing for a day is OK,
just don&#8217;t let that day stretch into a week and then a month. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You have to accept failures as natural and develop a tough mental state to deal with them. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
second step is to learn from your mistakes.&nbsp; Quite often learning
from your mistakes will be more efficient than learning from your
successes.&nbsp; When you fail, treat it as a lesson learned.&nbsp; it
is just like in business, when you fail at something, you learn the
things that don&#8217;t work.&nbsp; This is the same with weight loss.&nbsp;
If you have slipped off your new diet every time you drink, then maybe
you avoid drinking.&nbsp; If you realize that every Friday you miss out
on exercise because of a late work meeting then reschedule your workout.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8220;I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.&#8221;</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">?Thomas A Edison</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Failure
is&nbsp; natural part of life, along with death and taxes.&nbsp; You
can&#8217;t avoid it, and even if you could you wouldn&#8217;t want to.&nbsp; Your
life&#8217;s lessons are learned through your failures along with your
successes.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t fear failure, persist through and learn from it.
</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Buddy System</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One
of the best things you can do when you are tying to lose weight is to
add some accountability to your routine.&nbsp; How do you do
that?&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The buddy system.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Having
a buddy to try and lose weight with is a great motivator.&nbsp; You
will feel more accountable to reach your weight loss goals when you are
actually sharing them with someone.&nbsp; They can also be helpful
because the person is someone that can relate to you about struggling
to lose weight.&nbsp; You can share your triumphs in joy, and your
setbacks in support.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If
you are working out regularly a buddy is invaluable.&nbsp; They can
change a boring walk or jog into an exercise slash therapy
session.&nbsp; A hike in the wilderness is always more fun with a
friend along!&nbsp; If you are into weight lifting it is also nice to
have a buddy.&nbsp; You guys can challenge each other while at the same
time providing encouragement and practical help like spots on heavy
lifts.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It
is sad to say but in this day and age, you can probably find yourself a
weight loss buddy in your group of friends.&nbsp; if you can&#8217;t, don&#8217;t
panic you can always do it virtually online as well.&nbsp; You could
find a friend on Facebook that is losing weight and work with
them.&nbsp; Having Facebook chats and sharing progress pictures on
Facebook.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are also many web forums and sites dedicated to linking weight loss partners up virtually.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
bottom line is this - if you want to lose weight working with a friend
can provide motivation, support as well as the always important
accountability.&nbsp; Find your weight loss buddy now!</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Why Maintaining a Daily Schedule is Critical </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
next step in planning your weight loss goals is to set up a daily
schedule for yourself. You need to decide when the best time for you to
exercise is. For instance, if you are not a morning person, getting up
two hours earlier than you are used to is probably not a good plan
because you are likely to miss many mornings. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">At
the same time, if your job causes you to work late into the evenings
frequently, scheduling your workouts for after work is not a wise idea
either. You can also schedule out your meals, including the times you
eat each day, and schedule out what your meals will be. The best thing
to do is to schedule them out for a week at a time, and make a list and
stick to it, so when you go shopping you will not be as tempted to
impulse buy or stray off of your diet. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Keeping Yourself in Check: If you have a specific schedule to follow,
you are more likely to stick to your goals by writing everything down
in a journal or other recording device like a smartphone. But, if you
do miss a scheduled workout, or have an extra snack, you can keep note
of it and vow to do better the next time. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Knowing What You Are Doing Each Day: Having what time you are supposed
to be doing your workouts or eating your meals written down can keep
you in the know ahead of time, and in this way you can schedule things
around your workout times, rather than scheduling over them and just
missing workouts altogether. This can be easy to do, and if you start
doing this, it will eventually snowball into increased times where you
are missing your workouts, until you are thrown off track completely. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&#8226;
Lose More Weight: By keeping yourself on a schedule, you will tend to
lose more weight in the end because you will be likely to not miss any
workouts (or very, very few in the long run). If you keep going back
and forth and missing your workouts, or skipping a meal and confusing
your body&#8217;s metabolism, you will have a much harder time maintaining a
steady rate of weight loss. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></body></html>
