          Every year 20+ billion dollars goes unclaimed in the United
          States.&nbsp; Millions of Americans are owed this money but
          either don't know it exists or don't know how to find it.
          &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Here are 7 things everyone needs to know about unclaimed
          money:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1 - ANYONE can have money owed to him or her!</b><br>
          <br>
          Money that ends up in the unclaimed databases can come from
          many places including old bank accounts, savings bonds,
          inheritance, payroll checks, the list goes on and on.&nbsp;
          There are approximately 200 million people who are owed
          unclaimed money.&nbsp; Oprah stated 8 out of 9 families are
          owed unclaimed money.<br>
          <br>
          The money may be from a source you were never even aware
          existed like a savings bond from when you were a child or an
          inheritance. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          The government will not look for the owners of unclaimed
          money.&nbsp; They will happily keep the money and borrow from
          it or earn interest on it for as long as they can.&nbsp; This
          is apparent from the fact that Microsoft, Ryan Seacrest, Reese
          Witherspoon, Julia Roberts, Kate Hudson and Benicio Del Toro
          are all owed money. <br>
          <br>
          Unless you do a search, don't assume you don't have unclaimed
          money.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2 - Your money may be under a different name</b><br>
          <br>
          When you do an unclaimed money search the money may be listed
          under a variation of your name.&nbsp; For example: if your
          name is William M Smith the money may be listed under Bill M
          Smith, B M Smith, W M Smith, etc. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Depending on the source of the funds and the way the name was
          listed on that account the money may be listed under a
          variation of your legal name.<br>
          <br>
          The money may also be listed under the name of a co-signer on
          the account.&nbsp; If the account was not solely in your name,
          it might very well be under the name of the person who shared
          the account(s) with you.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3 - It helps to know past addresses</b><br>
          <br>
          When you perform an unclaimed money search you enter a name
          and then are given a list of results that match the entered
          name.&nbsp; The results will include some or all of the
          following information: account number, name on account, last
          known address on account and amount owed.&nbsp; Knowing the
          past addresses of the person whose name you are searching is
          helpful in identifying which accounts actually belong to that
          person.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>4 - You may be owed money that was reported outside
            your state</b><br>
          <br>
          If you have ever lived outside your current state of residence
          or have done any business with any company(s) outside your
          state, the money may be reported in the state where the
          company existed. <br>
          <br>
          For example: If you lived in California your whole life but
          had an insurance policy with a company in New York and they
          had no address on record, the money owed from the policy would
          be listed in the New York state database not California.<br>
          <br>
          Inheritance is often reported in the state of residence for
          the deceased, since it is unclaimed chances are the heir's
          address is unknown.<br>
          <br>
          Most states have their own searchable database, but remember,
          searching your own state is not enough.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>5 - Make sure to complete all steps of the claims
            process </b><br>
          <br>
          The claims process will vary depending on the type of
          account.&nbsp; Typically driver's license, social security or
          birth certificate are required.&nbsp; If you are an heir
          additional paperwork such as death certificate and other
          executor documents may be required. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          If you search a good quality database, they will provide you
          the claim instructions.&nbsp; Make sure to include all
          information and documentation requested.&nbsp; If you omit
          forms or required data your claim may not be processed and
          they will send a request for more information which will delay
          receipt of your money.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>6 - You can search for family and friends </b><br>
          <br>
          Databases allow you to search multiple names.&nbsp; You can
          search the names of your family and close friends to see if
          they are owed money.&nbsp; Since most people are unaware this
          money is sitting around, most have not searched their name to
          see how much is owed to them. <br>
          <br>
          While researching for this article I found $400 owed to my mom
          from 2 different accounts! &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <b>7 - Unclaimed tax refunds will not be found</b><br>
          <br>
          Tax refunds owed from prior tax years will not be in the
          databases, UNLESS you have filed for the year(s) you are owed
          money.&nbsp; You have up to 3 years to submit for a tax
          refund.&nbsp; After that time expires you will no longer be
          able to claim your tax refund.&nbsp; That means 2003-2005
          taxes can be filed for a tax refund but entitlement to 2002
          tax refunds expired on April 17, 2006.<br>
          <br>
          So, if you are owed money from 2003-2005 tax years make sure
          to file your taxes for those years to claim your tax refund.<br>
