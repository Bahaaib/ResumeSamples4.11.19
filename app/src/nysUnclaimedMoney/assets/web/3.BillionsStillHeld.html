          The unclaimed money vault of New York continues to experience
          heavy influx of unclaimed money and is now considered to be
          one of the largest state treasuries in terms of unclaimed
          money. As of the last estimate, the state of New York is home
          to almost $10 billion of unclaimed funds. A majority of this
          abandoned money comes from the following sources: 25 million
          inactive bank, business, and government accounts unclaimed by
          their owners and in the care of the state controller's office.
          While the New York State treasury is taking all the right
          steps to spread the awareness about unclaimed funds, the
          volume of incoming unclaimed funds keeps the deficit growing.<br>
          <br>
          The process of reclaim and search for unclaimed money has been
          simplified to a great extent in the last couple of years.
          State treasury has taken very dynamic and innovative steps and
          created far reaching programs to convey this message. The
          results of this aggressive awareness campaign can be seen in
          the increasing number of claim inquiries and the number of
          refunds that the state treasury has made.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The state has launched a very informative and user-friendly
          website to help the state resident claim their lost funds. In
          addition to these efforts, New York State Comptroller's Office
          of Unclaimed Funds (OUF) is also collaborating with the state
          treasury to return the unclaimed funds to its actual owners. <br>
          <br>
          New York, being one of the most cosmopolitan states in the
          country, is also prone to a lot of inter-state and foreign
          worker migrations. It is home to one of the largest Diasporas
          of foreign work force. This ethnically complex landscape has a
          great influence on the volume of unaccounted funds and
          properties. Apart from being a multi-cultural state and a hub
          for foreign workers, New York is also a great attraction for
          retirees. With number of retirees increasing every year, the
          volume of unclaimed money is also getting larger.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The state of New York publishes an "Abandoned Property
          Supplement" of the New York State Register, which contains a
          list of abandoned property. This supplement is published by
          New York State Department of State, 162 Washington Avenue,
          Albany, NY 12231. The Department of State runs this list in
          hopes to reach out to the citizens and increase the number of
          claimants.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          As a result of its highly proactive unclaimed funds policies,
          New York has also been one of the most successful states in
          reuniting the owners with their lost money. The outreach
          program of the state, along with the National Association of
          Unclaimed Property Administrators (NAUPA), a nonprofit
          organization affiliated with the National Association of State
          Treasurers, has simplified the process of reclaim and also
          been highly successful in creating unprecedented awareness
          about the unclaimed money pool lying with the state
          treasuries. So, if you have ever resided in New York, now is
          the time to search for your unclaimed funds.<br>
