          Unless you won the lottery this week you would probably be
          excited to find money owed to you. Unclaimed money and
          property in excess of $25 Billion is being held by the
          government and is just waiting to be claimed.<br>
          <br>
          You may be thinking, 'I have never forgotten about money owed
          to me', this may be true, but what about the monies you are
          not aware of? i.e. an inheritance or savings bond. Oprah
          Winfrey stated 9 out of 10 Americans have unclaimed money.<br>
          <br>
          So why is this money just sitting around? Chances are you
          haven't heard about unclaimed money, there is a lack public
          awareness and no simple method for searching and claiming lost
          funds.<br>
          <br>
          The most common types of Unclaimed Property are:<br>
          <br>
          · Savings and checking accounts and safe deposit box contents<br>
          <br>
          · Stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and dividends<br>
          <br>
          · Uncashed cashier's checks or money orders<br>
          <br>
          · IRS refunds<br>
          <br>
          · Wages, child support payments<br>
          <br>
          · Matured or terminated insurance policies<br>
          <br>
          · Estates<br>
          <br>
          · Mineral interests and royalty payments, trust funds, and
          escrow accounts<br>
          <br>
          · The list goes on and on...<br>
          <br>
          One of the most impressive unclaimed items is a 88-carat
          natural blue sapphire ring valued at over $25,000! Recently a
          widow found over $50,000 owed to her from an account her
          deceased husband had opened that she was not even aware
          existed.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The property ends up in government accounts due to laws
          requiring the property to be turned over to the state or other
          governing agency after a period of approximately 3 years
          without contact from the owner.<br>
          <br>
          Oftentimes the owner moves and does not leave a forwarding
          address or forgets that the account exists. In some cases, the
          owner dies and the heirs have no knowledge of the property.<br>

          So how do you search and find money owed to you? Each state
          has its own database but it is not enough to search only the
          state where you reside. If you have conducted business with
          companies outside the state, the funds may be reported in the
          state where the business was located. Also, a state search
          will not locate missing money in 90 federal databases. <br>
          <br>
          This makes searching difficult because you may have unclaimed
          cash in a state in which you have never lived.<br>
          <br>
          You also need to search variations of your name. For example,
          if your name is Michael James Anderson an account might be
          under M Anderson, M J Anderson, or Michael Anderson.<br>
          <br>
          This can be a time consuming and tedious process to locate and
          search over 120 databases. The most comprehensive government
          site only incorporates 14 states into its database. This
          search would still produce incomplete results and you may miss
          money owed to you.<br>

          It is possible to pay a fee to utilize a private site that has
          compiled all state and government databases. After you have
          completed your search by name you will be given results from
          the database. It may contain multiple records, some of which
          are not yours. <br>
          <br>
          The record will normally have details on the property, the
          value, institution the funds originated from, owner address,
          etc. You should be able to tell which accounts are yours from
          a quick look at these details.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          After locating your missing money follow the procedure to
          submit a claim. The claim process varies slightly depending on
          the type of account or state of claim. Usually the claim
          consists of filling out and sending a form or affidavit and
          copies of identification or documents relating to the account.<br>
          <br>
          Through continued efforts to educate the public on the topic
          of unclaimed money more and more Americans are finding their
          lost funds. It is possible that you or your immediate family
          members have unclaimed money or property. <br>
          <br>
          Now that you are aware it exists and know how to find and
          claim it, you can search for what is owed to you!<br>
