          In the slow economy Americans now face, with the job market
          shrinking just a little bit every day, the competition is
          fiercer than ever to find and secure good-paying, skilled jobs
          in a number of fields.&nbsp; As popular as the resume may be
          in helping land the coveted interview and a shot at the big
          time, no less important is the cover letter that accompanies
          it.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          A very good reason for this?&nbsp; Employers want to see a
          sample of your communication skills, whether or not you can
          convey your thoughts well in written form, and in turn put
          those same skills to proper use in a position with their
          company.&nbsp; A resume, while professional enough, lacks a
          certain 'heart'.&nbsp; The resume is almost automatic, robotic
          in its presentation, and written without any real flair or
          passion or charisma that so many employers most want to
          see.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          How can you really express yourself from the inside in a
          resume, apart from presenting your skills, your education and
          a brief background of your experience?<br>
          <br>
          The cover letter, or the letter of introduction, when included
          with a resume, puts you at the top of the 'slush pile' of
          applicants, and when written correctly, shows the employer
          your personality.&nbsp; If that sounds silly, think a moment
          about your attitude when you read about a job opening.&nbsp;
          Are you excited about it, because you fit the qualifications
          perfectly?&nbsp; Or are you less than enthusiastic about it,
          and figure 'What the heck, I'll apply.'?&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          First off, don't apply for the job if it doesn't fit your
          needs.&nbsp; This letter is going to illustrate your FEELINGS,
          so make sure you are really excited about this particular job
          position, and you think that it meets your expectations 100%.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Writing the Opening</b><br>
          <br>
          Start out with your basic formal and courteous greeting.&nbsp;
          Identify yourself, where you live, your reason for writing,
          and what you are looking for.&nbsp; Some examples:<br>
          <br>
          "Dear Mr. Temple:<br>
          <br>
          My name is Paul Ryan, from Cleveland, Ohio.&nbsp; I've been an
          engineer for approximately 10 years, but was recently laid off
          after a series of cutbacks initiated by upper
          management.&nbsp; I read about a job opening in the Plain
          Dealer last Friday, and after looking through the needed
          requirements, the skills being sought and the location for the
          job, this particular position would be a perfect fit for me."<br>
          <br>
          "To the management of Empress Maids:<br>
          <br>
          Hello!&nbsp; My name is Carol Wilde, a recent arrival to your
          city from Los Angeles.&nbsp; My reason for writing to you
          today is in response to an advertisement that was seen at my
          local library, requesting the need for someone to assist in
          administration duties with Empress Maids Cleaning
          Service.&nbsp; Having been a housekeeper for several years,
          along with possessing clerical and secretarial skills, it
          seemed a great idea for me to apply and offer my resume."<br>
          <br>
          Notice that the pronoun "I" is not used heavily.&nbsp; You
          want the employer to see you as confident, not arrogant.&nbsp;
          Nothing turns off an employer faster than saying, "I can do
          this, I can do that. I feel qualified. I am the man (or woman)
          for the job."&nbsp; Also, it's a good idea not to go overboard
          with long words, or unnecessary verbiage.&nbsp; Ask any
          screenwriter -- it's very difficult to express tone and mood
          through words alone.&nbsp; The two examples show applicants
          who seem motivated, excited and friendly.&nbsp; As this is the
          first part of your letter, it's the 'establishing shot', so to
          speak.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>A Little About Me</b><br>
          <br>
          Again, try not to go on and on about yourself.&nbsp; Remember,
          it's a "little".&nbsp; Just talk about your experiences for a
          few sentences, and any notable highlights you feel are
          important or interesting enough to warrant mentioning because
          it can have an impact on the employer's decision in the long
          run.&nbsp; Remember that you have a resume that tells about
          your experience too, so don't get carried away and talk too
          much about one particular job or position.&nbsp; Let's see
          what Paul and Carol write next:<br>
          <br>
          Paul: "Hanover Incorporated has been my primary place of
          employment the last ten years, since graduating with Honors
          from Pitt University in 1997.&nbsp; I was very fortunate to
          have bumped into this position after meeting with my career
          counselor, Brenda Baxter, in my senior year, and she was very
          helpful in getting me in the door.&nbsp; Since that time, my
          duties varied from field work to blueprints and technical
          applications.&nbsp; My concentration in the past few years has
          been in the field of digital designs and CAD, which is one of
          the main requirements you are seeking for the engineering
          candidacy at Temple Inc.&nbsp; My work was also instrumental
          in the design and construction of a power plant currently
          located in Toledo, Ohio, now offering electricity to nearly
          500,000 people."<br>
          <br>
          Smooth, Paul.&nbsp; This is excellent.&nbsp; Already we know a
          little more about Paul's expertise, his education and some
          significant events.&nbsp; Notice too that we can tell that
          Paul is able to work well with others, and is obviously quick
          to give credit where it is due.&nbsp; Paul would be effective
          in a supervisory role at some point, no question about
          that.&nbsp; Mr. Temple would certainly look at Paul as a good
          choice so far!<br>
          <br>
          Carol:&nbsp; "My background in housekeeping spans
          approximately 20 years, actually for as long as my twin sons
          have lived within the family home.&nbsp; Since they have gone
          away to law school now, I felt it was a good time to re-enter
          the work force.&nbsp; My clerical and office skills come from
          my years before marriage, when I worked part-time in between
          college degrees as a data entry supervisor, responsible for
          maintaining databases, producing reports and handling numerous
          job requests from my co-workers, such as light computer
          repair, spell-checking and phone calls.&nbsp; My experiences
          in a bustling office environment, combined with several years
          of knowledge in housekeeping and good cleaning skills, make me
          a good candidate for the position of Administrator for Empress
          Maids."<br>
          <br>
          Very well done, Carol.&nbsp; In a few sentences, she tells us
          that she's a wonderful mother who has provided for her family,
          has exceptional clerical and administrative skills, and is
          really confident about what she can do.&nbsp; We can tell she
          obviously has done a great job raising her sons, if they are
          off to law school -- and she's well-educated herself.&nbsp;
          From here, we can see that she's competent, versatile and
          determined.&nbsp; These are some amazing qualities employers
          really want to see that stand out from the pack.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>In Closing</b><br>
          <br>
          It's important to thank the employer for his or her time, and
          mention the resume if you like.&nbsp; You do not really need
          to say anything else.&nbsp; Do NOT try "I really hope you hire
          me." or "I really need this job." or even "You'll be very glad
          you picked me."&nbsp; That just defeats the message you were
          trying to convey to the employer in the first place.<br>
          <br>
          Paul:&nbsp; "In closing, thank you very much for your time and
          the consideration of the enclosed resume.&nbsp; Have a great
          week and hope to hear from you."<br>
          <br>
          Sincerely,<br>
          <br>
          Paul Ryan<br>
          <br>
          -------------<br>
          <br>
          Carol: "I hope my resume meets with your approval.&nbsp; Thank
          you very much for your time and am looking forward to a
          possible interview with you in the future."<br>
          <br>
          Respectfully,<br>
          <br>
          Carol Wilde<br>
          <br>
          That's it.&nbsp; Short and sweet.&nbsp; Your cover letter
          should segue seamlessly to your resume.&nbsp; When the
          employer has had a chance to see a little of your
          communication and writing techniques, and a peek into your
          personality, you can be sure that the employer will consider
          it a pleasure to meet you face to face. It can also guarantee
          that your resume will get a lot more than a casual once-over
          -- provided your resume is just as hot, of course!<br>
