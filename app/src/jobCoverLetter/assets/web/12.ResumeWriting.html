          Looking for a new job, whether it is with a new company or a
          promotion within your own organisation, requires time and
          effort. To make your job search more effective you need to
          take five fundamental steps on the road to success:<br>
          <br>
          · Analysing your skills<br>
          <br>
          · Writing a winning Resume<br>
          <br>
          · Managing your job search<br>
          <br>
          · Coaching for interview success<br>
          <br>
          · Negotiating your job offer<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 1: Analysing your Skills</b><br>
          <br>
          The most crucial step in the job search process is to assess
          what skills you have to offer to your future boss. At an
          interview you will have to tell your story. An interviewer
          will not remember your precise details, but they will remember
          your story, once it is filled with practical examples.<br>
          This means that you have to be able to explain the four
          'what's' of your job:<br>
          <br>
          · What do you do?<br>
          <br>
          · What skills do you require to successfully carry out your
          role?<br>
          <br>
          · What have you achieved?<br>
          <br>
          · What benefit did your company get from employing you?<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          The answers to these questions can be used to draft a
          one-minute sound bite of the skills that you have to offer to
          your future boss. This sales pitch should incorporate details
          about your role, your achievements and your personal qualities
          and should be tailored to the position you are applying for.<br>
          <br>
          For example, 'experienced Software Engineer who has worked in
          a multinational telecommunications environment; part of a team
          that developed an innovative process for a groundbreaking
          platform; proficient in all aspects of the development life
          cycle; used a variety of languages particularly C++ and Java;
          excellent organisational skills combined with a practical and
          resourceful approach to problem solving'.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 2: Writing a Winning Resume</b><br>
          <br>
          This summary of your skills becomes the cornerstone of your
          resume. Your resume must be tailored to the needs of your
          future boss so customise it accordingly.<br>
          <br>
          Here are some guidelines to assist you to write a winning
          resume:<br>
          Aim for a two-page resume - page one should be devoted to how
          your skills match the position with a emphasis on your recent
          career details. Page two to your less recent career history,
          education, training and relevant personal details. Decide on
          your key selling points. Provide evidence of this experience.
          Include quantification - reduction in costs, increase in
          efficiency, improvement in processes, saving in time, etc.<br>
          <br>
          Use simple, jargon free words - if techno speak is required,
          explain it! Decide on the style after the structure and
          content have been finalised.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Step 3: Managing your Job Search</b><br>
          <br>
          The third step to securing your job search success is to
          manage the process. There are three elements to effectively
          managing your job search process:<br>
          <br>
          · Controlling channels<br>
          <br>
          · Analysing jobs<br>
          <br>
          · Constructing compelling cover letters<br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Controlling </b><b>C</b><b>hannels</b><br>
          <br>
          There are four distinct job search channels. Draw on all four
          to maximise your success:<br>
          <br>
          1. Contacts - use (in a positive sense!) all of the people
          that you know, both professionally and personally.<br>
          <br>
          2. Media - this includes newspapers (both national and local)
          and professional/trade magazines.<br>
          <br>
          3. Agencies - access both online sources and the more
          traditional recruitment agencies.<br>
          <br>
          4. Direct approach - get in touch with companies that require
          your skills set.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Analysing </b><b>J</b><b>obs</b><br>
          <br>
          Each job that you apply for is different, so you have to
          analyse its requirements to ensure a match between you and the
          role. This entails assessing the job description, the person
          specification and the environment within which the role
          operates. Draw up a checklist of the skills required for that
          job. If you have at least a 60% match, apply!<br>
          <br>
          Constructing compelling cover letters<br>
          <br>
          Your cover letter (typed!) should contain three paragraphs:<br>
          <br>
          · Why you are applying for the job<br>
          <br>
          · How your skills match the requirements of the position<br>
          <br>
          · What outcome you want to achieve (an interview!)<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 4: Coaching for Interview Success</b><br>
          <br>
          Your interviewer wants to know two things - can you do the job
          and will you fit in. Your RESUME prompts the interviewer's
          questions in relation to 'can you do the job'. These questions
          revolve around the who, what, when, where, how and why of your
          current job (the technical details of your job).<br>
          <br>
          The issue of whether you will fit in is crucial to your
          interview success. You may be technically superb, but if your
          interviewer believes that you will 'upset the applecart',
          he/she will not hire you. This means that your interview
          preparation should also concentrate on the non-technical
          aspects of your role. For example, how you relate to your
          colleagues and boss, how you have contributed to your team,
          how you have resolved potential interpersonal difficulties,
          etc.<br>
          <br>
          Regardless of whether you are talking about the technical
          aspects of your job, or the non-technical elements, use real
          life examples to illustrate your point. Provide a picture in
          the interviewer's mind of the competent, capable person that
          you are.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 5: Managing your Job Offer</b><br>
          <br>
          Following a successful interview, build on your success by
          negotiating an attractive job offer. This involves maximising
          your remuneration package and ensuring that your contract of
          employment exceeds the legal minimum.<br>
          Know what you own requirements are but make sure that they are
          in line with the reality of today's labour market. You also
          need to ensure that all of your referees give you a glowing
          reference and that they emphasise the skills that you want
          highlighted.<br>
