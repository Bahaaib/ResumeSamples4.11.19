          When you are looking for a job, you will need to have a great
          resume, but you also need an amazing cover letter to get the
          attention of the potential employer. There are a places you
          can look for a job application cover letter sample to help you
          in designing your own cover letter. However, some samples are
          better than others, so you will need to know how to determine
          if what you are looking at is a good job application cover
          letter sample.<br>
          <br>
          When you are looking at a job application cover letter sample,
          check to see if it has any spelling or typing errors. A key
          component of a good cover letter is to run it through spell
          check and read it over. A person writing a quality job
          application cover letter sample for you to use knows how
          important it is for you to make that great first impression
          through proper grammar and spelling.<br>
          <br>
          Another point that a good job application cover letter sample
          will make is that you need to address the cover letter to the
          person in charge hiring you. Yes, some places have a personnel
          department where your cover letter and resume will go to
          hibernate for a while, but most people in charge of hiring
          have a name. A good job application cover letter sample will
          show that you need to address it to a person rather than “to
          whom it may concern.”<br>
          <br>
          A good job application cover letter sample may be helpful in
          giving you an idea of how to draw up an attention grabbing
          cover letter, but you should change things around into your
          own words. You want to use your cover letter to give the
          employer a chance to get to know you, not Job Application
          Cover Letter Sample Author. A good job application cover
          letter sample should be a starting point for your cover
          letter, not a cookie-cutter letter to attach to your resume.<br>
          <br>
          Taking the job application cover letter sample and making it
          your own unique cover letter also means doing some research
          into the company to which you are going to be sending a resume
          and gearing the letter to that particular company. This means
          that you will need to change some of the content of the job
          application cover letter to reflect the industry you are
          considering. By making this change to the job application
          cover letter, you will be showing the potential employer that
          you have given them some thought and consideration.<br>
          <br>
          One way to achieve this change to the job application cover
          letter sample is to use phrases and words that are important
          to the potential employer. Knowing the industry to which you
          are looking into will help you make the changes to the job
          application cover letter wording that will make your cover
          letter appear targeted to your audience. You may even want to
          reiterate what the employer put in the job description in bold
          type.<br>
          <br>
          Taking an effective job application cover letter sample and
          making it your own can help you in catching your potential
          employer’s attention and getting your foot in the door. Make
          sure that the job application cover letter sample you are
          considering is well-written and points our the areas in which
          you can add pertinent information.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          You finally finished your resume and now it’s time to write
          your application letter. You know in order to get noticed you
          need your application letter to really stand out to the
          employer. You want that interview, but you don’t know the
          first thing about writing an application letter. You
          understand all the key points, but you’re no good at
          organizing your thoughts on paper.<br>
          <br>
          So you turn to your computer, log on to the internet and
          Google “free application letters”. Hundreds of websites pop up
          offering tons of free application letter samples. You can’t
          believe your luck. You click through a few sites and find a
          letter you like. Your are positive that this one that will
          knock the socks off the hiring manager. You feel confident, as
          you copy and paste it onto a word document, that this letter
          will pretty much guarantee you an interview.<br>
          <br>
          Let’s face it you found it online and it claims to be written
          by a professional, therefore you can’t go wrong. You change a
          few words around, sign your name and off it goes. Now all you
          have to do is wait for that phone to start ringing.<br>
          <br>
          Let me tell you, you are going to be waiting a long, long time
          for that call. Take heed of this application letter sample
          warning. While these sample letters can help guide you in how
          to write an application letter, they should never be used as a
          substitution for your real work. Most employers review a
          countless amount of application letters and resumes daily.<br>
          <br>
          Do you really think that the free online application letter
          sample you “borrowed” is going to grab their attention?
          Chances are no. Is your application letter sample going to be
          original? Probably not. Is the application letter going to be
          written to show how you meet the employer’s needs? Again,
          probably not.<br>
          <br>
          Do you think you are the first person to go looking on the
          internet for free cover letter samples? In this day and age of
          the internet where you can find anything you need, chances are
          you are not the first person to use a free application letter
          sample.<br>
          <br>
          In fact it probably happens more often than you imagine. These
          employers received countless amounts of resumes and cover
          letters. They are so seasoned at reading application letters
          they will be able to tell yours is not your own after the
          first paragraph. This is why your application would really
          need to stand out to the employer. It’s doubtful that the
          application letter you found online is going to do that for
          you.<br>
          <br>
          A good application letter consists of a few key elements.
          Essentially it’s what you can do for the employer. The letter
          should show why the employer would be making a mistake not
          calling you for at least a interview. Your application letter
          needs to highlight some key points in your resume,
          specifically those points that qualify you for the job you are
          applying for.<br>
          <br>
          How is a letter that you found online going to do that? In
          order for your letter to get notice it needs to be original,
          and show your passion for your work. Can an application letter
          you get online be original? That is highly doubtful. Your
          letter also needs to ask for the opportunity to be interviewed
          and needs to give the employer options to make that happen.<br>
          <br>
          Again, would your sample application letter provide that? If I
          was a gambler, I would bet the house that the answer would be
          no.<br>
          <br>
          Instead of using the internet to find a free application
          sample letter to pass off as your own, use the internet to
          research how to write a effective application letter. Anything
          that has the word sample in it, is meant to be just that. A
          sample. Something to sort of push you in the right direction.<br>
          <br>
          The most important things to remember is that applications
          letters should be original and they should represent you. The
          only person, who can represent you, is you. Why would you want
          to take an application letter written by someone who does not
          even know you? Only you know why you would be perfect for that
          one job.<br>
          <br>
          Why trust a generic letter to get that point across to the
          employer?<br>
