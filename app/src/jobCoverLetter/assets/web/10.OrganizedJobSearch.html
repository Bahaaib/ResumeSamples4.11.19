    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Many people, under financial or other pressures to find work
          quickly, feel they can’t afford to take the time to get
          organized. On the other hand, conducting your job search in an
          organized manner will reduce the amount of time you spend
          looking for information, following inappropriate leads, or
          waiting for your dream job to fall into your lap. It generally
          takes at least a month to find an entry-level job, and as much
          as nine months for one requiring a high level of skill and
          experience. Getting organized before you begin your job search
          can ultimately save you a lot of time and frustration.<br>
          <br>
          You should take several preliminary steps before you even
          begin your active job search. You should start by identifying
          your skills, interests, target market, and any child care,
          transportation, or other issues that you will need to keep in
          mind. A career or employment counselor can be very helpful in
          this area, as well as with the preparation of your resume,
          cover letters, and any other job search materials you will
          need.<br>
          <br>
          Once you’re ready to face the job market, there are three
          areas where you’ll find it beneficial to be well organized:
          your schedule, your workspace, and your contacts.<br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Your Schedule</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          First, you must decide how much time you can realistically
          commit to your job search on a weekly basis, and then create a
          weekly schedule of activities. Keep in mind that looking for a
          full-time job is in itself a full-time job! Some of your time
          will be devoted to reading and applying for advertised
          positions, but be sure to allow plenty of time for other job
          search activities such as making telephone calls, generating
          and researching new leads, reviewing old leads for follow up,
          writing thank you notes or other correspondence, and visiting
          placement offices, employment agencies, or other service
          providers. The percentage of time you dedicate to each
          activity depends on what is most effective for your field of
          work or geographical area, so it may be worthwhile for you to
          ask others what has worked for them.<br>
          <br>
          Most people perform different activities more effectively at
          different times of day. Take your natural energy flow, as well
          as the availability of quiet time for conducting research and
          telephone calls, into consideration when planning your
          schedule. If quiet time is not available at home during the
          daytime or evening, an employment resource center can be an
          invaluable resource.<br>
          <br>
          Keep your personal preferences in mind when planning your
          activities. For example, if you dislike talking on the
          telephone, it may be less stressful for you to get your calls
          out of the way before beginning your other activities, or to
          intersperse your phone calls between other activities so you
          don’t become overwhelmed. If you’re planning to drop off
          unsolicited resumes, map out a route of targeted businesses
          that are in a particular area, and plan to cover the entire
          area in one day. This will cut down on your travel time and
          expenses as well as the number of times you need to dress up.<br>
          <br>
          Keeping a log of the actual time you spend on each activity
          will allow you to see whether you are on track and to identify
          any problem areas. It’s not uncommon to become frustrated and
          depressed when you’re out of work, so be sure to schedule
          regular time for self-care and other personal activities like
          going to the gym or the hairstylist.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b></font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Your Workspace</b></font></big></big></div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          At a minimum, you need a chair and a desk or table with plenty
          of space for you to work with your information, make and
          receive telephone calls, and plan your job search. All
          necessary supplies should be stored close by, including paper,
          pens, index cards, paperclips, staples, and your telephone
          directory. <br>
          <br>
          During your job search, you’ll likely accumulate various
          versions of your resume and cover letter, job postings,
          company profiles, advertisements, and business cards, but they
          will be of no value to you if you can’t find what you need. A
          binder or filing system, sorting the information into topics,
          will allow you to refer quickly to both the job posting and
          that specific application when you receive a telephone call
          from a prospective employer. It will also allow you to find
          easily any other information you may have gathered about the
          organization before your interview.<br>
          <br>
          You may find it beneficial to have an alternate “job search
          office” such as your local library or employment centre, where
          you can research, read, and write without the distractions you
          may encounter at home. Many are equipped with computers that
          you can use for Internet job search as well as resume and
          cover letter preparation, which can be a great benefit if you
          don’t have a home computer or must share it with other family
          members. <br>
          <br>
          If you plan to use this type of service on a regular basis,
          you’ll need some type of portfolio or briefcase to hold your
          job search material, including your resume in printed form and
          on a diskette, your calendar, and a notebook for jotting down
          leads and ideas. Most facilities do not allow you to receive
          telephone calls, so be sure that potential employers can reach
          you by voice mail, pager or cell phone.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, you’ll need a calendar for marking down job
          interviews and other important meetings. You’ll also need a
          system for keeping track of your job applications. This
          information may be needed to confirm your eligibility for
          unemployment insurance or social assistance, and will help you
          to follow up on your applications.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Your Contacts</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          During your job search, you will probably communicate with
          hundreds, if not thousands, of people, but in order to make
          effective use of the network you develop, you’ll need a way to
          keep track of all your contacts.<br>
          <br>
          The simplest method is a card file system, with a card for
          each contact. Each card should include the contact’s name,
          title, organization, address, telephone number, fax, and email
          address, the source of the lead, and dates and details of any
          conversations, correspondence, or interviews. You may find it
          helpful to set up a “recipe box” with a set of dividers
          labeled with the days of the week and a set numbered 1-31 for
          the days of the month. You can file each card under the date
          you wish to contact that person. For example, you may speak
          with someone on the 10th who suggests that you call him or her
          in two weeks. After noting the information on the index card,
          file it in the section for the 25th where it will serve as a
          reminder for you to follow up.<br>
          <br>
          There are wonderful software programs available that can help
          you with organizing your job search contacts. WinWay Resume,
          for example, has a section for storing contact information
          that you can merge with your cover letter. ACT! allows you to
          schedule tasks and reminders as well as perform mail merges.
          If you don’t wish to buy or learn a new software package,
          email address books in Outlook, Outlook Express or in free
          Web-based email packages are also an excellent way to keep
          track of your contacts. <br>
          <br>
          However, unless you have unrestricted access to a computer, or
          a portable system such as a decent tablet, you won’t be always
          able to access the information. The key features of any
          organizational system are ease of recording and ease of
          retrieval. If using an electronic system will make your job
          search more complicated and time-consuming, don’t use it.<br>
          <br>
          Job searching can be overwhelming, but when you organize your
          schedule, workspace, and contacts effectively, you’ll be able
          to stay on track and find your new job more quickly.<br>
