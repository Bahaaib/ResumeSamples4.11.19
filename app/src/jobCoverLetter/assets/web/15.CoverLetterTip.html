          <b>Searching for a new job?</b><br>
          <br>
          I am about to reveal one of the most powerful cover letter
          tips you'll ever discover. This little-known secret can
          dramatically increase your job interview requests all by
          itself.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Here's a 'not-so-subtle' hint for you:</b><br>
          <br>
          P.S. -- This tip works like a charm and commands the attention
          of every reader!<br>
          Did you catch that hint? It's true, by adding a simple P.S. --
          or Post Script -- after your signature, at the bottom of your
          cover letter you can literally grab the undivided attention of
          any person reading it. And, if your P.S. is a brief, direct
          and clearly-worded request for the opportunity to be
          interviewed, you will land more job interviews than the vast
          majority of your competition.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Why does the P.S. work so perfectly with a cover
            letter?</b><br>
          <br>
          Advertisers and marketers have been using the P.S. to sell
          various widgets successfully for decades. In fact, it is one
          of the most powerful sales strategies of all time. The general
          public has literally been 'trained' by these highly-skilled
          marketers to read any P.S. they see at the end of a letter.
          Many times consumers shoot straight to the end of the letter
          to read the P.S. first! I'll bet you've done this yourself on
          more than one occasion.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Use the P.S. to clearly and directly ASK for the job
            interview providing your contact number as well.</b><br>
          <br>
          This is a fresh way to appeal to employers and can tip the
          balance in your favor towards landing the all-important job
          interview. The P.S. lets a busy Hiring Manager cut right to
          the chase by reading this one special sentence. A job-seeker
          who uses a P.S. in his or her cover letter is utilizing one of
          the strongest marketing strategies known to man.<br>
          <br>
          This cover letter tip can be the difference-maker in your job
          search. Remember, it all starts with getting your foot in the
          company door and a well crafted P.S. will get noticed and read
          above all other sentences. So make sure yours packs an
          interview-landing punch!<br>
          <br>
          <b>P.S. -- Your job search is all about results. Try this one
            cool, cover letter strategy for yourself and see how many
            job interviews you land!</b><br>
