          The purpose of a job cover letter is to introduce you and your
          resume as well as give some additional information about
          yourself to potential employers.&nbsp; You may also want to
          point out some parts of your resume you want the employer to
          pay special attention to.<br>
          <br>
          An individually typed cover letter typically accompanies each
          resume you send out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your cover letter may make
          the difference between obtaining a job interview and having
          your resume ignored. It makes sense to devote the necessary
          time and effort to write effective cover letters.<br>
          <br>
          A cover letter should complement, not duplicate your resume.
          Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume
          and add a personal touch. A cover letter is often your
          earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a
          critical first impression.<br>
          <br>
          There are three different kinds of cover letters:<br>
          <br>
          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The application letter responds to a
          specific job opening you have seen advertised<br>
          <br>
          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The prospecting letter inquires about any
          job openings<br>
          <br>
          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The networking letter which requests
          information and assistance in your job search<br>
          <br>
          If you are sending out a resume, your application cover letter
          should always include a line in your cover letter that says
          where you found the advertisement for the job you are applying
          for.&nbsp; If you saw it in a newspaper, be sure to underline
          the name of the newspaper (grammar rules count!)<br>
          <br>
          You should always tailor your cover letter to the specific job
          you are applying for.&nbsp; It's certainly easier to write
          generic or blanket cover letters than it is to write a cover
          letter specifically targeted to each position you apply for.
          However, if you don't invest the time in writing cover letters
          you're probably not going to get the interview, regardless of
          your qualifications.<br>
          <br>
          Our first tip in writing a cover letter that works is to make
          a match between your qualifications and education with the
          job.&nbsp; This takes some time and effort and it's not always
          easy, but, it's important. Take the job posting and list the
          criteria the employer is looking for.<br>
          <br>
          Then list the skills and experience you have. Either address
          to how your skills match the job in paragraph form or list the
          criteria and your qualifications.<br>
          <br>
          Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential
          employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).<br>
          <br>
          Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest
          in the specific organization and identify your most relevant
          skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by
          the employer's self-interest). They should express a high
          level of interest and knowledge about the position.<br>
          <br>
          To be effective, your cover letter should follow the basic
          format of a typical business letter and should address three
          general issues:<br>
          <br>
          1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First Paragraph - Why you are writing<br>
          <br>
          2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Middle Paragraphs - What you have to
          offer<br>
          <br>
          3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Concluding Paragraph - How you will
          follow-up<br>
          <br>
          In some cases, you may have been referred to a potential
          employer by a friend or acquaintance. Be sure to mention this
          mutual contact, by name, up front since it is likely to
          encourage your reader to keep reading!<br>
          <br>
          If you are writing in response to a job posting, indicate
          where you learned of the position and the title of the
          position. More importantly, express your enthusiasm and the
          likely match between your credentials and the position's
          qualifications.<br>
          <br>
          If you are writing a prospecting letter a letter in which you
          inquire about possible job openings - state your specific job
          objective. Since this type of letter is unsolicited, it is
          even more important to capture the reader's attention.<br>
          <br>
          If you are writing a networking letter to approach an
          individual for information, make your request clear.&nbsp; The
          advantage to writing a letter like this and including your
          resume is that you will be making contacts in the business
          world and when a job opening comes up, they may still have
          your resume on file.&nbsp; It never hurts to be pro-active
          when looking for a job!<br>
          <br>
          In responding to an advertisement, refer specifically to the
          qualifications listed and illustrate how your particular
          abilities and experiences relate to the position for which you
          are applying. In a prospecting letter express your potential
          to fulfill the employer's needs rather than focus on what the
          employer can offer you.<br>
          <br>
          You can do this by giving evidence that you have researched
          the organization thoroughly and that you possess skills used
          within that organization.<br>
          <br>
          Emphasize your achievements and problem-solving skills. Show
          how your education and work skills are transferable, and thus
          relevant, to the position for which you are applying.<br>
          <br>
          Close by reiterating your interest in the job and letting the
          employer know how they can reach you and include your phone
          number and/or email address. If you want, you can make a bid
          directly for the job interview or informational interview and
          indicate that you will follow-up with a telephone call to set
          up an appointment at a mutually convenient time. Be sure to
          make the call within the time frame indicated.<br>
          <br>
          In some instances, an employer may explicitly prohibit phone
          calls or you may be responding to a *blind want-ad* which
          precludes you from this follow-up. Unless this is the case,
          make your best effort to reach the organization. At the very
          least, you should confirm that your materials were received
          and that your application is complete.<br>
          <br>
          If you are applying from outside the employer's geographic
          area you may want to indicate if you'll be in town during a
          certain time frame (this makes it easier for the employer to
          agree to meet with you).<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, you may indicate that your references are
          available on request. Also, if you have a portfolio or writing
          samples to support your qualifications, state their
          availability.<br>
          <br>
          So, we've covered the three most important documents you need
          in a job search:&nbsp; the resume, the cover letter, and the
          reference sheet.&nbsp; Before you get excited and start
          mailing out your creations, there are some things that you
          need to do prior to that.<br>
