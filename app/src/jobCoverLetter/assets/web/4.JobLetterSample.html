          After many years as a senior manager in a world leading
          international bank's Human Resource Management division, and a
          further 10 as a partner in my own HR and Management Consulting
          Company, I thought, until recently, that I had seen every type
          of résumé, good and bad.<br>
          <br>
          I was wrong.<br>
          <br>
          Onto my desk came two, both of which almost took my breath
          away, one for its superb simplicity, the other for the gall of
          the candidate for even thinking of sending it to me. <br>
          <br>
          The good one, no, the superb one, which came via email, was
          (co-incidentally) also for an HR position (not in my company),
          it covered just two exceptionally informative pages, and its
          presentation was very attractive. <br>
          <br>
          It was in six parts:<br>
          <br>
          <b>* The factual</b><br>
          <br>
          - name<br>
          <br>
          - address<br>
          <br>
          - primary phone number (her cell/mobile)<br>
          <br>
          - secondary phone number (home)<br>
          <br>
          - primary and secondary email addresses (neither with
          childish/immature names)<br>
          <br>
          - her highest academic qualification<br>
          <br>
          - her highest vocational/professional qualification <br>
          <br>
          <b>* Her Career Objective</b><br>
          <br>
          A simple, but powerful statement of her intent, it read:<br>
          <br>
          "Having risen to the position of Head of Human Resources in my
          current company, I now seek an opportunity where I may
          capitalize on my experience and my strengths, either heading
          up the HR function in a larger company, or as a senior
          consultant in an established Management Consultancy." <br>
          <br>
          <b>* Summary of Her Qualifications for the Job</b><br>
          <br>
          These covered:<br>
          <br>
          - Top academic qualification<br>
          <br>
          - Top professional qualification<br>
          <br>
          - Professional memberships<br>
          <br>
          - Professional Licences<br>
          <br>
          - Number of years in relevant managerial posts<br>
          <br>
          - Most significant achievement relevant to post for which she
          was applying<br>
          <br>
          <b>* Her Attributes, Skills and Experience</b><br>
          <br>
          These covered:<br>
          <br>
          - Foreign languages (she spoke three fluently)<br>
          <br>
          - Software applications with which she was experienced<br>
          <br>
          - Number of years she had been professionally qualified <br>
          <br>
          - Work related achievements and accomplishments, especially
          those where significant financial savings were made or
          innovative systems introduced<br>
          <br>
          - National or local awards given (she had won the nation's HR
          Manager of the Year award in 2007)<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>* Employment History</b><br>
          <br>
          This covered:<br>
          <br>
          - All permanent posts since graduating<br>
          <br>
          - Reason for change (in her case it was three companies, all
          within the same Group and were moves upon promotion)<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>* Education</b><br>
          <br>
          This covered:<br>
          <br>
          - Year Awarded Top academic qualification (hers was an
          MBA)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Name of College<br>
          <br>
          - Year Awarded Next highest academic qualification (her was a
          BSc)&nbsp; Name of College<br>
          <br>
          - Years At school with name of school and highest school exams
          passed <br>
          <br>
          - Do not go back further than High School/Secondary School<br>
          <br>
          Her resume concluded with a statement that references would be
          supplied upon request (these should be preferably from someone
          you have known professionally, not a friend or family member).
          <br>
          <br>
          She also rightly stated that she was seeking a remuneration
          package that was in excess of that she presently received, and
          would be very willing to negotiate.&nbsp; Try to avoid
          divulging your package at this stage if you can, as it weakens
          your bargaining power, but sometimes the advert will call for
          details of your package, which you should give (honestly!).<br>
          <br>
          <b>* Tips on construction</b><br>
          <br>
          - Neat and concise<br>
          <br>
          - No grammar or spelling errors, check and check again<br>
          <br>
          - Make headings and titles bold<br>
          <br>
          - Never use more than two fonts or colors<br>
          <br>
          - Never more than two pages at 10-12 point font<br>
          <br>
          - Exaggerate at your peril! But do give extra-emphasis for big
          plus points<br>
          <br>
          - Even if you photograph well, I advise against including a
          photograph. Few people photograph very well, and it is sad to
          say, but even recruiters can be subjective, and if they do not
          like your face, your resume may go straight into the "no"
          pile. Sometimes you have no choice, in which case keep it
          looking a professional as possible.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>* Cover letter</b><br>
          <br>
          - Personalise each and every letter you send to a potential
          employer<br>
          <br>
          - If you know the name of the person hiring, or the Head of
          HR, address the letter to them personally (if you don't know
          do your best to find out and only use "Dear Sir/Madam as a
          last resort)<br>
          <br>
          - Do not forget to include your home address, telephone
          number, mobile number and email address <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          - Even if you are still using your present employer's office,
          do not use their address or telephone numbers<br>
          <br>
          - Do not repeat content in the same way that is already in
          your CV, but do strongly emphasize your strengths as indicated
          in the CV.&nbsp; Start by referring to the particular post
          offered, and end with a comment thanking (potentially) your
          next employer for their time in reading the CV and that your
          look forward to meeting them at interview. <br>
          <br>
          - You should not use more than three paragraphs, and as with
          your CV, either 10 or 12 point. The choice of font, for both,
          is up to you, but an interesting tip I was once given was to
          use Palatino Linotype as most paperback books are set in this
          type and therefore most recruiters will be familiar to this
          font and find it easy to read.&nbsp; It is a Word font. <br>
          <br>
          - Check, re-check and check again for any spelling or grammar
          errors. If you are emailing your CV and cover letter (cover
          email) please make sure you have not left any of Word's wavy
          green or red lines to indicate spelling or grammar errors. <br>
          <br>
          - If the company has given you any specific instructions, such
          as deliver by a certain date - make sure you comply. If your
          country's postal system is unreliable, either deliver by hand,
          or use a courier company. <br>
          <br>
          - If you're emailing the letter and resume, I urge you to put
          both into pdf format - it looks much more professional than
          Word. If you do not have Adobe, you can get a pdf format
          document free on the net at:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          https://www.pdfonline.com/convert_pdf.asp converted from your
          Word, Excel or Powerpoint document. <br>
          <br>
          - Remember, your CV will NOT get you the job, but, done well,
          it should get you the interview<br>
          <br>
          Oh, yes, before we move on to talk about the interview itself
          (in part two of this article, next week, or maybe in a day or
          so, if I can clear my mounting in-tray and in-box), a quick
          word about the bad example I received that same day - it will
          not take long to talk about. <br>
          <br>
          The CV was badly photocopied, it was six pages long, poorly
          laid out and was attached via paper clip to a so-called cover
          letter. I say so-called, as it was a hand written note,
          scruffily written on a page torn out from an old school
          exercise book, and addressed "To Whom it May Concern".<br>
          <br>
          It went straight into the waste bin. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
