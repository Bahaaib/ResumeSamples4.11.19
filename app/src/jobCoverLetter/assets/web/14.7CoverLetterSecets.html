          Just like the late, great Rodney Dangerfield, the "humble"
          cover letter gets no respect.<br>
          <br>
          Job-seekers spend so much time and energy on their resumes
          they've got nothing left to offer their poor, neglected cover
          letters.<br>
          <br>
          Big, BIG mistake!<br>
          <br>
          It is the well-written cover letter not the resume that can
          single-handedly land you more job interviews. The cover letter
          is your one chance to really "market" yourself to an employer
          using proven marketing strategies rarely found in the typical
          cover letter.<br>
          <br>
          Conversely, there's only so much you can do with the
          traditional CV or resume. I believe the carefully crafted
          cover letter is more important to your job search success than
          any other written document, including the resume.<br>
          <br>
          As a direct marketing professional for over 20 years, I bring
          to you my 7 secrets of a highly-effective resume cover letter:<br>
          <br>
          <b>ADDRESS </b>your cover letter to a specific person. Do
          your best to find out "To Whom" you should address your cover
          letter. "Dear Manager" is lifeless.<br>
          <br>
          <b>OPEN</b> with an attention-grabbing first sentence to
          really grip the reader. This will almost guarantee your cover
          letter and resume get a closer look.<br>
          <br>
          <b>REMEMBER</b> less is more. The best cover letters have
          plenty of white space. Cover letters that are clear, focused,
          short and sweet land more job interviews period.<br>
          <br>
          <b>FOCUS</b> on what you can do for the employer. How can you
          benefit the company specifically? Do a little research and
          relate this simply and clearly in your letter.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>CHOOSE WORDS </b>that show enthusiasm and passion for
          the position you seek... (big, big secret!) Then, carry this
          passion into the interview with you.<br>
          <br>
          <b>REQUEST ONE ACTION </b>you want the employer to take: "I
          would really like the opportunity for a personal interview
          this week." (You never know until you ASK.)<br>
          <br>
          END your cover letter with something enthusiastic and telling
          like, "I look forward to being interviewed at your earliest
          convenience. Thank you so much for this opportunity."
          Sincerely, Jane Jobseeker. (Notice how Jane assumes she'll
          land the interview? This is clever, smart, and it works like a
          charm).<br>
          <br>
          Think of your cover letter as a sales letter. The only purpose
          of your resume cover letter is to land you more job
          interviews. That's the bottom line. By using the proven
          marketing strategies I've outlined above you will land more
          quality job interviews than your competition.<br>
          <br>
          You must find a way to get your "foot in the company door" to
          have any chance of landing the job. With the right cover
          letter you can blow the doors of opportunity wide open. And
          remember, more job interviews translate to (drum roll
          please)... more job offers.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, the most important advice I can offer you is this: <br>
          <br>
          <b>FOLLOW-UP every job lead, contact, and communication. </b>Following
          up is the "golden key" to getting hired for the job of your
          dreams. Use follow-up cover letters, thank you letters, even
          follow-up phone calls. Following-up can literally double your
          chance for success. It is also the one secret ingredient
          missing from 99% of every job-seeker's playbook.<br>
          <br>
          Good news for you!<br>
