          The last paragraph of your cover letter can be very powerful.
          How you end it could leave a lasting impression with the
          employer – good or bad. So before you sign off using your
          typical, “Please call me at your earliest convenience to set
          up an interview” kind of mumbo-jumbo, take care to let the
          employer off the hook and put the responsibility to follow-up
          squarely on your shoulders.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Mark this date</b><br>
          <br>
          By stating that you’re going to follow up with the employer on
          a particular day makes you appear confident and willing to go
          the extra mile for an interview. It makes them feel important
          and that you honestly want to know about the job if you are
          willing to follow up with them.<br>
          <br>
          It also eases the pressure off of them since they expect you
          to call. If they’re interested in speaking with you, they
          might set your resume aside and mark it down in their planner
          that you are going to call. That way they can be prepared to
          schedule and interview.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Do what you say</b><br>
          <br>
          Whatever you do, if you write in your cover letter that you’re
          going to call them on a specific day, by all means – do it! By
          not following through, you have jeopardized ever getting
          called by the employer.<br>
          <br>
          This is actually worse than including a passive ending in your
          cover letter. By not following up like you claimed you would,
          you’re showing yourself to be irresponsible - not a highly
          sought out trait for a new employee.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Go the extra mile</b><br>
          <br>
          If you follow up the date that you stated and never could get
          in touch with the contact, you can leave a voice mail stating
          that you were following up on the specific job posting. You
          can choose to follow-up with an email and/or try to call them
          back another day. The point is to let them know that you
          followed up when you said you would.<br>
          <br>
          Now don’t get me wrong, you do want to try to actually speak
          to them. However, you don’t want to harass them either. Give
          it a couple of shots and if you can’t get them on the phone,
          leave a message and follow-up via email, if you so choose.<br>
          <br>
          Follow-up is very important. That’s why stating you’re going
          to do so in your cover letter is impressive and important to
          the hiring manager. Keep it simple, keep your word and you
          might just come out with an interview.<br>
