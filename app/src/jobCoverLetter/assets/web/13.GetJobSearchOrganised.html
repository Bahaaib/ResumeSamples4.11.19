          What was the name of the manager you met at last month’s
          business mixer? Did you ever follow up on the application you
          mailed two weeks ago? Which version of your résumé is the most
          recent one -- without the typos? If you’re asking yourself
          questions like these, your job search could benefit from some
          organization.<br>
          <br>
          The typical job search can generate a daunting stack of paper
          and a backlog of communications from many channels at once. If
          you are actively looking for work, you may quickly find
          yourself buried in multiple versions of your résumé, copies of
          cover letters, clippings and printouts of job listings,
          business cards from people you have met, e-mails sent and
          received, bookmarked web pages, phone messages, flyers for
          networking events, and much more.<br>
          <br>
          To keep all these essential job search components organized,
          here’s what you will need:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1. Calendar</b> – You’ll need to keep track of
          appointments, when you sent out résumés or placed phone calls,
          and what date you should be following up with people you speak
          to. Use whatever system works best for your personal style: a
          pocket datebook, a PDA (e.g. Palm Pilot), or task management
          software on your computer (e.g. Outlook) are all appropriate
          choices.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>2. Contact Manager </b>– To take full advantage of
          your personal connections, you will want to maintain a list of
          everyone you speak with about your job search, along with
          their complete contact information, when you last spoke, and
          what you discussed. Contact management software such as
          Outlook or ACT! is one option, but you can also use a card
          file, notebook, or large address book.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Filing System</b> – On your computer, set up a special
          folder to hold all your job search materials, and create
          sub-folders to help you find items quickly. Be sure to give
          all your documents distinct names. Instead of simply “Resume,”
          for example, you might use names like “Resume updated with
          feedback from Ken” or “Resume sent to Marshall Co” to identify
          different versions.<br>
          <br>
          For your e-mail, use the same idea to save copies of e-mails
          you send or receive in separate folders in your e-mail system.
          You might create one folder for all your job search
          correspondence, or if you are a heavy e-mail user, add
          sub-folders for each prospective employer or opportunity. Also
          use a folder to organize bookmarked web pages, such as job
          postings you check regularly.<br>
          <br>
          With paper documents and clippings, the type of system you
          choose should depend on whether your job search needs to be
          mobile. File folders in a drawer or standing file work well if
          you will always be conducting your job search in the same
          location. If your job search needs to travel, a better
          solution might be a three-ring binder with dividers or an
          accordion file with several pockets.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>4. Task List </b>– You’ll need a way to keep track of
          what may seem like an endless list of things to do.
          Appointments and notes to follow up on a certain date can be
          put in your calendar, but you’ll also need a way to track
          tasks with no date assigned as well as daily or weekly
          activities. Some PDA’s and contact or task management software
          offer this feature, or you can keep your master task list in a
          document on your computer, in a notebook, or on a bulletin
          board or whiteboard.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have set up a system to organize your job search,
          you’ll need to remember to use it. Get in the habit of making
          entries in your calendar or contact manager immediately,
          rather than saving them up for later. When you print
          documents, open postal mail, or receive e-mails, file them
          right away, making a note of any action you need to take on
          your task list. Don’t try to use a pile of paper as your
          reminder.<br>
          <br>
          One technique that can help to keep your job search visibly
          organized is creating a “job wall.” Dedicate some wall space
          or the back of a door to your job search and post a large
          calendar, list of job postings to check regularly, events to
          attend, people to talk to, and important tasks you want to
          keep in mind. Use sticky notes to highlight important
          deadlines or projects. You could also keep the same material
          in a three-ring binder prominently displayed on your desk.<br>
          <br>
          Whatever organization system you choose, find a way to keep
          your job search activities constantly in front of you and
          check your to-do list often. If everything you need is buried
          in a drawer, a pile, or your briefcase, your job search won’t
          get as much attention.<br>
