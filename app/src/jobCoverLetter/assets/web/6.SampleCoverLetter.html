          As we've said, the cover letter can be just as important as
          the resume, so you will want it to look as professional and
          intriguing as it can.&nbsp; We found a few sample letters
          online that you may want to use to refer to when crafting your
          own cover letters.<br>

          <br>
          Dear Mr. Weatherby,<br>
          <br>
          My outgoing personality, my sales experience, and my recently
          completed education make me a strong candidate for a position
          as an insurance broker for California Investments, Inc.<br>
          <br>
          I recently graduated from the University of Oregon with a
          degree in marketing, where I was president of both the Future
          Business Leaders of America and the American Marketing
          Association.<br>
          <br>
          Although a recent graduate, I am not a typical new graduate. I
          attended school in Michigan, Arizona, and Oregon. And I've put
          myself through these schools by working such jobs as radio
          advertising sales, newspaper subscription sales, and
          bartending, all of which enhanced my formal education.<br>
          <br>
          I have the maturity, skills, and abilities to embark on a
          career in insurance brokering, and I'd like to do this in
          California, my home state.<br>
          <br>
          I will be in California at the end of this month, and I'd like
          very much to talk with you concerning a position at California
          Investments. I will follow up this letter with a phone call to
          see if I can arrange a time to meet with you.<br>
          <br>
          Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          <br>

          <br>
          Dear Ms. Heller,<br>
          <br>
          As marketing companies are increasingly called upon to supply
          information on magazine readership to publishers, there is a
          growing need for trained and experienced professionals in the
          field.<br>
          <br>
          Through my marketing/research experiences and my master's
          thesis, which have particularly dealt with improving marketing
          research studies so they can better define magazine audiences
          to potential advertisers, I am certain I could give you
          valuable assistance in satisfying research demands, managing
          key projects, and improving the marketing tools you currently
          use.<br>
          <br>
          I will be completing my master's degree in December and would
          be interested in making a significant contribution to the
          Research Institute's profitability in a marketing/research
          capacity.<br>
          <br>
          I am sure my services would be useful to you, and I will call
          you in early October to discuss an interview.<br>
          <br>
          Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
          <br>
          <br>

          Sincerely,<br>

          <br>
          <br>
          Dear Ms. Sumner,<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps I am the "multi-talented teacher" you seek in your
          "Multi-Talented Teacher" advertisement in today's Atlanta
          Constitution. I'm a versatile teacher, ready to substitute, if
          necessary, as early as next week. I have the solid teaching
          experience you specify as well as the strong computer skills
          you desire.<br>
          <br>
          I am presently affiliated with a highly regarded private
          elementary school. Mr. Craig, the headmaster, will certainly
          give you a good reference. The details of your advertisement
          suggest to me that the position will involve many of the same
          responsibilities that I am currently performing.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the planning, administration, and
          student-parent counseling duties I highlight in my resume,
          please note that I have a master's degree as well as a
          teaching certificate from the state of Georgia.<br>
          <br>
          Knowing how frantic you must be without a fifth grade teacher,
          I will call you in a few days. Or if you agree upon reviewing
          my letter and resume that I am the teacher you need, call me
          at the home number listed above, or at 555-7327 during
          business hours.<br>
          <br>
          Thanking you most sincerely for your time and consideration.<br>
          <br>
          Cordially,<br>
          <br>

          Dear Mr./Ms. Last Name:<br>
          <br>
          First Paragraph: Why You Are Writing. Remember to include the
          name of a mutual contact, if you have one. Be clear and
          concise regarding your request.<br>
          <br>
          Middle Paragraphs: What You Have to Offer. Convince the
          readers that they should grant the interview or appointment
          you requested in the first paragraph. Make connections between
          your abilities and their needs or your need for information
          and their ability to provide it. Remember, you are
          interpreting your resume. Try to support each statement you
          make with a piece of evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs
          rather than one large block of text.<br>
          <br>
          Final Paragraph: How You Will Follow Up. Remember, it is your
          responsibility to follow-up; this relates to your job search.
          State that you will do so and provide the professional
          courtesy of indicating when (one week's time is typical). You
          may want to reduce the time between sending out your resume
          and follow up if you fax or e-mail it.<br>

          Dear Mr. (or Ms.) last name,<br>
          <br>
          Start your letter with a grabber-a statement that establishes
          a connection with your reader, a probing question, or a
          quotable quote. Briefly say what job you are applying for.<br>
          <br>
          The mid-section of your letter should be one or two short
          paragraphs that make relevant points about your
          qualifications. You should not summarize your resume! You may
          incorporate a column or bullet point format here.<br>
          <br>
          Your last paragraph should initiate action by explaining what
          you will do next (e.g., call the employer) or instigate the
          reader to contact you to set up an interview. Close by saying
          *thank you.*<br>

          Dear Mr./Ms.<br>
          <br>
          Body of Cover Letter<br>
          <br>
          The body of your cover letter lets the employer know what
          position you are applying for, why the employer should select
          you for an interview, and how you will follow-up.<br>
          <br>
          First Paragraph:<br>
          <br>
          The first paragraph of your letter should include information
          on why you are writing. Mention the position you are applying
          for. Include the name of a mutual contact, if you have one. Be
          clear and concise regarding your request.<br>
          <br>
          Middle Paragraphs:<br>
          <br>
          The next section of your cover letter should describe what you
          have to offer the employer. Convince the reader that they
          should grant the interview or appointment you requested in the
          first paragraph. Make strong connections between your
          abilities and their needs. Mention specifically how your
          skills and experience match the job you are applying for.
          Remember, you are interpreting your resume, not repeating it.
          Try to support each statement you make with a piece of
          evidence. Use several shorter paragraphs or bullets rather
          than one large block of text.<br>
          <br>
          Final Paragraph:<br>
          <br>
          Conclude your cover letter by thanking the employer for
          considering you for the position. Include information on how
          you will follow-up. State that you will do so and indicate
          when (one week's time is typical). You may want to reduce the
          time between sending out your resume and follow up if you fax
          or e-mail it.<br>
          <br>
          Complimentary Close:<br>
          <br>
          Respectfully yours,<br>
          <br>
          Signature:<br>
          <br>
          Handwritten Signature (for a mailed letter)<br>
          <br>
