          Did you wear clothes to your last job interview? Silly
          question, right? As unthinkable as it would be to arrive nude
          to an interview, you are essentially committing the same faux
          pas when you send your resume to a potential employer
          unaccompanied by a well-written cover letter.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Three Indisputable Truths About Cover Letters </b><br>
          <br>
          Whether we're talking about a cover letter or your best
          interview suit, three indisputable truths apply.<br>
          <br>
          First, like a good interview suit, a cover letter is
          essential. At some point in your life before you embarked on
          your career, a wise person advised you to purchase a quality
          business suit. And you did just that. Somewhere in your closet
          hangs the black, navy blue, or gray suit you've reserved for
          your interviews. No employer needs to tell a rational
          candidate that professional dress is expected for the
          interview. <br>
          <br>
          Even in creative industries, it is understood that the
          candidate should wear a business suit, although more latitude
          is given for color and style choices than in traditionally
          conservative fields. Similarly, unless the job announcement
          indicates otherwise, a potential employer expects that the
          applicant will provide a cover letter. Although the
          announcement may not explicitly state that a cover letter is
          preferred, it is always good practice to include one if for no
          other reason than to demonstrate how effectively you can
          communicate your ideas and thoughts in writing.<br>
          <br>
          Second, a cover letter complements your resume. One goal of
          any interview is to project a confident demeanor and a
          polished appearance. In preparation for your interview, you'll
          have your suit dry cleaned, the hems mended, and any loose
          buttons secured. You may also starch your shirt or blouse and
          polish your shoes. <br>
          <br>
          To complete your ensemble you'll carefully select the perfect
          accessory, perhaps a gold watch, pearl necklace, or leather
          attacheÂ´. Just as the right accent piece can enhance your
          interview attire, so, too, can a well-written cover letter add
          to the attractiveness of your resume. When you lay out your
          wardrobe for your upcoming interview, you would not plan to
          wear two shirts, two suit jackets, and two pair of pants. <br>
          <br>
          Likewise, your cover letter should not merely be a duplication
          of the information included in your resume. Think of your
          cover letter as the finishing brushstrokes on a painting
          masterpiece.<br>
          <br>
          Third, a cover letter is tailored. Your interview suit is
          tailored to fit you perfectly. The pants are neither too short
          nor are the jacket sleeves too long. You could lend your suit
          to a friend, but it wouldn't look nearly as wonderful on him
          or her because it has been tailored for you. In like manner,
          the most effective cover letters don't read as though they
          could fit any and every position. <br>
          <br>
          Instead, they are individualized to fit the specific position
          for which the applicant is applying. In other words, if you
          are submitting your resume for ten different positions, you
          need to write ten different cover letters. Nothing signals a
          questionable work ethic more to a potential employer than
          receiving a generic, cookie cutter cover letter where it
          appears the applicant did little more than change the date and
          cut and paste the addressee's contact information.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Writing the perfect cover letter doesn't have to be an ordeal.
          In fact, it can be as easy as spelling C-O-V-E-R. COVER is an
          acronym for a five-step paragraph-by-paragraph approach you
          can use to write an effective cover letter. Over the next few
          pages, I will show you how you can use the COVER formula and
          the announcement for the position for which you are applying
          as a handy guide to craft the perfect complement to your
          resume.<br>
          <br>
          To illustrate how this works, we'll use an actual job
          announcement that was recently posted on a popular online job
          site. The entry level position was for a human resources
          assistant at an Atlanta consulting company that, for purposes
          of this article, we'll refer to as ABC Consulting. Assume
          you've read the job announcement and wish to apply for the
          position. Your resume is ready. Now, let's write the cover
          letter!<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step One:</b> Cultivate a CONNECTION in the first
          paragraph. The C in the COVER formula stands for connection.
          Step one in creating the perfect cover letter is to establish
          a connection in the first paragraph. When you are introduced
          to someone, you engage in conversation to get to know the
          person better and discover what the two of you have in common.
          The same principle holds true when cultivating an authentic
          connection with a potential employer.<br>
          <br>
          To build a connection with an employer, you need to conduct
          what I call intelligence. Intelligence is conducted on three
          distinct levels: (1) the company or organization at which you
          would be working; (2) the specific department or division in
          which you would be working; and (3) the individual(s) for whom
          you would be working. Doing your homework on a prospective
          employer serves a dual purpose. <br>
          <br>
          First, educating yourself about a company will help you better
          assess if the company's mission, values, and culture are
          compatible with your own goals and working style. Second, if
          you decide there is a good fit, the person reading your cover
          letter or sitting across the desk from you during the
          interview will be impressed that you took the initiatve to
          investigate the company for which you aspire to work. I
          suggest creating a file (as simple as a manila folder) for
          each company you research where you can organize your notes,
          store your printouts, and save your correspondence. This way
          all your vital information will be in one place for quick
          reference and easy retrieval later.<br>
          <br>
          Let's return to the sample job announcement posted by ABC
          Consulting. Here is the basic job description for the
          position:<br>
          <br>
          "ABC Consulting located in downtown Atlanta, GA is currently
          seeking a professional, bright, savvy, and hard working Human
          Resource Assistant for our corporate office. If you are a
          bright individual who is seeking to work in the HR field in a
          great entry-level position and likes to work in a fast-paced
          environment, this could be the experience for you!!"<br>
          <br>
          The first crucial piece of information in the job description
          we are given is the name of the hiring company. Armed with
          that information, your initial step is to visit the official
          corporate website. Pay particular attention to those pages
          detailing the company's philosophy, culture, core values,
          vision, and mission statement. <br>
          <br>
          While there, you'll want to familiarize yourself with the
          company's history and the names of its officers or executive
          board members. I also suggest that you visit the media page to
          read recent press releases. This is an excellent resource to
          learn about any community service initiatives with which the
          company may be involved. After you review the company's
          website, head over to its Twitter or Facebook pages to
          continue your research. Thanks to the fluid nature of social
          networking, you can find the most current news events there. <br>
          <br>
          The final front of research on the company level can be
          conducted using internet search engines such as Google and
          Bing.<br>
          <br>
          The second level of intelligence you'll need to conduct is on
          the department level. While on the corporate website, look for
          a link for the department where you would be working. There
          you may find a personnel directory, an explanation of newly
          instituted programs, links to online newsletters, and other
          valuable information.<br>
          <br>
          The third level of intelligence is on the individual level. If
          the job announcement lists the name of the person to whom you
          would report, or if you can find this information out, check
          to see whether the person's biographical details are included
          on the company's official website. You'll also want to check
          whether the person maintains a profile on social networking
          outlets such as LinkedIn and Facebook. Bear in mind that your
          ultimate goal is to discover what things you have in common
          with your potential boss. For example, you may be alumni of
          the same college, belong to the same professional group or
          club, or share a unique hobby or interest.<br>
          <br>
          After you have completed and compiled your research, give some
          thought about how you can incorporate one aspect of what you
          learned into the first paragraph of your cover letter to
          cultivate a connection.<br>
          <br>
          For instance, suppose that your research revealed that ABC
          Consulting's employees helped construct a Habitat for Humanity
          house last month. If you are a regular volunteer with Habitat
          for Humanity, you can make a connection with the company by
          explaining your personal commitment to working with Habitat on
          previous projects and expressing the enthusiasm with which you
          look forward to working with the company on its future
          projects.<br>
          <br>
          If you conducted research on the human resources department
          and learned that it would be launching a software program for
          the first time next month and you have used that program
          successfully in a previous position, you can use this
          commonality as a basis for a connection:<br>
          <br>
          "Please accept this cover letter and the enclosed resume in
          application for the Human Resources Assistant position with
          your company. I had an opportunity to visit your official
          website. I understand from reading the December 2009
          newsletter that the human resources department plans to
          transition from its current software system to the PeopleSoft
          system in March. In my previous position, I helped train 10
          people in my department on how to use PeopleSoft."<br>
          <br>
          Through your research on the individual level, you may have
          learned that person for whom you would be working graduated
          from your alma mater's arch rival. If you were composing a
          cover letter to that person, your first paragraph might
          include the following connection:<br>
          <br>
          "I read in your online biography that you are actively
          involved in the University of Alabama's Alumni Association -
          Atlanta Chapter. I can assure you that this Florida Gator
          harbors no ill feelings about last year's SEC Championship
          Game."<br>
          <br>
          Cultivating a connection is all about beginning to form a
          relationship. People want to work with other people they like
          and with whom they share similar interests and values. It
          follows that if you can cultivate an authentic connection in
          your cover letter and you have the requisite skills the
          employer is seeking, there's a much greater likelihood you'll
          be called in for an interview.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step Two:</b> Give a brief OVERVIEW of who you are in the
          second paragraph. The O in the COVER formula stands for
          overview. While your resume gives great insight into what you
          have done, it is equally important to devote a few sentences
          in your cover letter to describe who you are. Ideally the
          connection you made in the first paragraph was enough to
          encourage the person reading your cover letter to read
          further. Now you must seize the moment to heighten that
          connection in your second paragraph.<br>
          <br>
          One way to do this is to elaborate on your personal brand
          statement, if you included one on your resume. In my article
          entitled Is It Time to Rethink Your Resume's M.O.?, I wrote
          about the importance of including a powerful brand statement
          on your resume. An effective brand statement weaves your key
          strengths into tangible benefits you can provide a prospective
          employer. You can use the overview section of your cover
          letter to explain some aspect of your brand statement in more
          depth. <br>
          <br>
          Another option is to explain why you chose to pursue a
          particular career path. Perhaps you are passionate about
          promoting green issues, advocating for children with special
          needs, or writing advertising copy. Infuse the enthusiasm you
          have for pursuing your professional passion into your cover
          letter to show a potential employer you will bring that same
          degree of dedication to the position.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Step Three: </b>VOICE your interest in the position in
          the second paragraph. The V in the COVER formula stands for
          voice. In the first two or three sentences of the second
          paragraph, you told the person reading your cover letter more
          about who you are. In the next few sentences, you want to
          connect who you are with why you are interested in the
          position. <br>
          <br>
          Consider what prompted you to respond to the job announcement
          or explain how you felt when you learned about the job
          opening. Incorporate some of the intelligence you conducted
          under Step One to list two or three strong reasons why you
          want to work for this particular employer.<br>
          <br>
          Returning to the ABC Consulting job announcement, here's an
          example of how our cover letter looks so far, including the
          second paragraph:<br>
          <br>
          "Please accept this cover letter and enclosed resume in
          application for the Human Resources Assistant position with
          your company. I had an opportunity to visit your official
          website. I understand from reading the December 2009
          newsletter that the human resources department plans to
          transition from its current software system to the PeopleSoft
          system in March. In my previous position, I helped train 10
          people in my department on how to use PeopleSoft.<br>
          <br>
          Up until five years ago, I ran a small internet-based business
          from my home. A chance encounter at a friend's dinner party
          changed my career path forever. It was there where a mutual
          friend introduced me to Jane Doe, then-Chair of the Board for
          the Society for Human Resource Management - Atlanta. Our
          conversation ignited a longstanding desire to work in the
          human resources field. <br>
          <br>
          I was excited to learn of this opening with ABC Consulting
          because of its ongoing partnership with local area charities
          including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, where I have been a
          volunteer for the past ten years. I was also impressed to read
          on your corporate blog that ABC Consulting has been named one
          of the Best Places to Work in Atlanta for a third consecutive
          year."<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step Four:</b> Include specific EXAMPLES of your experience
          and skills in the third and fourth paragraphs. The E in the
          COVER formula stands for examples. In the previous two
          paragraphs, you cultivated a connection with your potential
          employer and explained why you wanted to work for the company.
          Over the next two paragraphs, you need to make your sales
          pitch, explaining the concrete value you can provide the
          employer. <br>
          <br>
          The cues provided in the job announcement are the blueprint
          for your sales pitch. Most job announcements include a
          description of the position's duties, essential functions,
          required and preferred education, work experience, skills, and
          abilities, or any combination of these. This is where we'll
          start.<br>
          <br>
          To understand how to approach your sales pitch, let's return
          to our hypothetical Human Resources Assistant position at ABC
          Consulting. The expanded job description appears below:<br>
          <br>
          "HR Assistant performs a wide range of personnel duties within
          the procedural framework set forth by the Human Resource
          Department. Assists in the hiring and termination process, the
          company's recruiting and orientation programs. Compiles, keeps
          and maintains all aspects of the company's personnel records.
          Supervisory reports on disability, and date and reason for
          termination. Compiles various HR Reports. Oversees HR
          recognition programs, files employment records, searches
          employee files and furnishes information to authorized persons
          as requested. Oversees Payroll function adhering to payroll
          guidelines, acts as liaison between HR department, its
          managers and PEO as necessary."<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, the announcement listed 19 essential functions.
          I've listed the first five below:<br>
          <br>
          1. Conduct New Hire Orientation; explain company personnel
          policies, benefits, and procedures to employees or job
          applicants.2. Examine employee files regularly to respond to
          state and federal compliance requirements on behalf of
          company. Responds to managerial and state inquiries providing
          information for personnel actions. 3. Answer questions
          regarding examinations, eligibility, salaries, benefits, and
          other pertinent information. 4. Process, verify, and maintain
          documentation relating to personnel activities such as
          staffing, recruitment, training, unemployment claims and
          appeals working with outside vendor by supplying information
          timely. Upkeep of company job descriptions, assists in comp
          studies as requested. Maintain performance evaluations and
          classifications. 5. Gather personnel records from other
          departments or employees.<br>
          <br>
          Job duties and functions are generally listed in order of
          importance. In applying for a position, endeavor to address
          the first three duties and functions in your cover letter. If
          your experience doesn't match the top three, descend the list
          chronologically until you identify three. Using the keywords
          and phrases in the job announcement, provide quantifiable and
          specific examples of your work experiences. For instance, in
          applying for the Human Resources Assistant position, you might
          detail in this paragraph your experience conducting new
          employee orientation, maintaining personnel records, and
          answering employees' HR-related questions. Here's an example
          of how the third paragraph in your cover letter to ABC
          Consulting might read:<br>
          <br>
          "In my present role at XYZ Company, I am intimately involved
          in every phase of our employees' life cycle. I assist in the
          hiring process, including coordinating career fairs, creating
          job advertisements, screening resumes, and preparing offer
          letters. I conduct a two-day orientation and on boarding
          program to familiarize new hires with company benefits,
          policies, and procedures. I also maintain accurate payroll and
          personnel records for the 125 employees in our office. During
          a typical day, I interface with employees, all management
          levels, and outside agencies, as authorized, to answer
          personnel questions and furnish requested information."<br>
          <br>
          The ABC Consulting job announcement also listed numerous
          preferred skills and attributes a candidate should possess.
          These included active listening, speaking, time management,
          critical thinking, writing, and proficiency with Microsoft
          Office products and HRIS software. In paragraph four of your
          cover letter, you would describe particular instances when you
          used two or three of these preferred skills. More importantly,
          though, you should be able to articulate how you will use
          these skills to make a valuable contribution to your potential
          employer. Here's an example of how the fourth paragraph in
          your cover letter might read:<br>
          <br>
          "If extended an offer to join your company, I am prepared to
          make an immediate contribution in three ways. First, I have
          used the PeopleSoft software program for two years and have a
          high degree of proficiency. As ABC Consulting will be
          transitioning to this software in March, I can assist in
          training your employees on the system. Second, because I am
          comfortable speaking in front of any size group, I will be
          able to represent your company effectively in offsite
          recruiting events and succinctly convey information during new
          hire orientation. Last, my current position involves working
          on several projects at one time and generating reports under
          strict time deadlines. These tasks have enabled me to sharpen
          the kind of time management and prioritization skills that
          will be an asset to your company."<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step Five:</b> REQUEST an interview in the fifth paragraph.
          The R in the COVER formula stands for request. In the previous
          paragraphs, you made your sales pitch by giving specific
          examples of your relevant work experience and skills. In the
          final paragraph of your cover letter, it's time to close the
          sale by requesting an interview. First, you'll want to state
          how and when you will follow up with the person to whom you
          are writing to arrange an interview. Second, provide your own
          contact information in case the addressee is so impressed by
          your resume and cover letter he or she wants to call you first
          to arrange an interview. Last, by all means, you should thank
          the person who read your cover letter for his/her time and
          consideration. Here's an example of how the final paragraph in
          your cover letter to ABC Consulting might read:<br>
          <br>
          "I look forward to speaking with you in greater detail about
          how I can benefit ABC Consulting. I will follow up with you by
          phone in a few days to arrange an interview. Or, you can reach
          me at (555) 555-5555. Thank you for your time and
          consideration."<br>
          <br>
          Now, let's see how each of the elements in the COVER formula
          come together...<br>

          Please accept this cover letter and the enclosed resume in
          application for the Human Resources Assistant position with
          your company. I had an opportunity to visit your official
          website. [CONNECTION] I understand from reading the December
          2009 newsletter that the human resources department plans to
          transition from its current software system to the PeopleSoft
          system in March. In my previous position, I helped train 10
          people in my department on how to use PeopleSoft.<br>
          <br>
          <b>[OVERVIEW]</b> Up until five years ago, I ran a small
          internet-based business from my home. A chance encounter at a
          friend's dinner party changed my career path forever. It was
          there where a mutual friend introduced me to Jane Doe,
          then-Chair of the Board for the Society for Human Resource
          Management - Atlanta. Our conversation ignited a longstanding
          desire to work in the human resources field. [VOICE] I was
          excited to learn of this opening with ABC Consulting because
          of its ongoing partnership with local area charities including
          the Atlanta Community Food Bank, where I have been a volunteer
          for the past ten years. I was also impressed to read on your
          corporate blog that ABC Consulting has been named one of the
          Best Places to Work in Atlanta for a third consecutive year.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>[EXAMPLES]</b> In my present role at XYZ Company, I am
          intimately involved in every phase of our employees' life
          cycle. I assist in the hiring process, including coordinating
          career fairs, creating job advertisements, screening resumes,
          and preparing offer letters. I conduct a two-day orientation
          and on boarding program to familiarize new hires with company
          benefits, policies, and procedures. I also maintain accurate
          payroll and personnel records for the 125 employees in our
          office. During a typical day, I interface with employees, all
          management levels, and outside agencies, as authorized, to
          answer personnel questions and furnish requested information.<br>

          The sample letter provided above is simply that...a sample.
          Use the COVER formula explained in this article as a guide to
          draft a cover letter that best expresses your personality,
          qualifications, and desire to land the interview for the job
          you want. The time you invest to research a potential employer
          and craft a carefully worded cover letter will set you apart
          from your competition and pay dividends in the long run when
          your phone rings off the hook with interview opportunities!<br>
