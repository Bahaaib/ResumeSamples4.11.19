          In the 1992 USA Presidential election, political strategist
          James Carville hung a sign in Bill Clinton's Little Rock
          campaign office that read, “It’s still the economy, stupid.”
          His intent? Simply to keep everybody focused on the most
          important issue of the day. History clearly demonstrates he
          was right and George Bush Sr. was soundly defeated.<br>
          <br>
          The lesson to be learned from this is that even the most
          important among us; the inarguably qualified, are still not
          immune to a potential to overlook the obvious.<br>
          <br>
          When it comes to job-hunting, nearly everyone’s heard the
          mantra; You never get a second chance to make a first
          impression. True words to be sure - the importance of which,
          few will argue. Nevertheless, too many of us fail to
          appreciate how critical and how important the first impression
          really is.<br>
          <br>
          Need proof? Try a little experiment of your own. <br>
          <br>
          Sit down at a local mall or somewhere there are people to pass
          by you. Assume for a second that every person you see is more
          than qualified for whatever job you want to imagine. Your task
          is to look at each person and decide whether you would offer
          them a job or not.<br>
          <br>
          Strange as it may sound, you’ll find yourself saying things
          like, “That Person? Definitely not! Him? Maybe. Her? Not sure.
          That person? Without question!” and so on.<br>
          <br>
          The fact is, you can evaluate people and the reason is, we ALL
          do it subconsciously ALL the time. It’s intrinsic to
          fundamental human interaction regardless of who we are or
          where we come from. Ironically, we couldn’t stop engaging in
          this activity even if we wanted to.<br>
          <br>
          The chilling part of doing an experiment like this comes with
          the realization you could and were making INSTANT value
          judgments based solely on first impressions that, if it were
          in the real world, would have significant consequences
          [positive or negative] on the lives of those you’ve judged –
          and it only took you a second! <br>
          <br>
          Would it be too Carvillian of me to point out, “It’s still the
          First Impression stupid!” for success in the practice of job
          hunting?<br>
          Reflecting on my own experience as a trained recruitment
          interviewer for a Fortune 500 Company, first impressions
          colored nearly every interview. That’s not to say people were
          hired strictly on the way they looked but rather to point out
          those who made poor first impressions put themselves at an
          obvious and avoidable disadvantage from the get-go.<br>
          <br>
          There is another misunderstanding as it relates to first
          encounters. A first impression has so nothing to do with
          having to look like a movie star and everything to do with
          Looking the Part.<br>
          <br>
          Clearly few of us can compete with Britney Spears and I’ve
          never seen Brad Pitt looking back at me whenever I look in the
          mirror. The important aspect to understand here is that we
          must take what ever genetics has given us and then work
          diligently to a) ensure we make the best of it, and, b) make
          certain our appearance is convincing.<br>
          <br>
          Professional actor Dustan Hoffman has played many convincing
          roles ranging from a gangster to a woman. Aside from his
          obvious acting talent, what made him credible was how he
          appeared. A dress and makeup were essential for his role in
          Tootsie but hardly believable for his part as the Savant in
          Rain Man.<br>
          We can learn another lesson from actors. Practice, Practice,
          PRACTICE! Long before any actor steps on stage or in front of
          the camera, considerable time and effort has gone into
          rehearsing for the role expressly to achieve one thing –
          Believability!<br>
          <br>
          Actors look for guidance from other actors and directors in a
          focused effort to improve their presentation. Would it make
          sense we do the same if our comport; how we look, walk, talk,
          sound and appear - in the span of a few seconds - may make the
          difference in getting a job or not?<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Bottom Line:</b><br>
          <br>
          Too often the barriers that challenge us for success in
          anything are indeed fundamental, obvious and avoidable. In job
          hunting, we’d do well to observe James Carville’s minimalist
          approach and remember, “It’s STILL the First Impression
          stupid!”<br>
