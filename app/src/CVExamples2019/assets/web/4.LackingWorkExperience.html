To Provide When Lacking Work Experience </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">People think of
their resume as a collective of their education, skills and
professional experience. Many employers rely on resumes as form of job
applications for the open positions within their organizations. Thus it
is very important that you have a well-written CV prepared when
searching for jobs.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Creating a CV is
not an easy task, even if you are a professional with years
of experience and many skills. However, composing a CV when you are
looking to completely change careers, or when you are fresh out of
school is much more difficult, because you do not have any experience
to highlight. If you are changing careers, and nothing from your past
professional experience qualifies you for the new job you are seeking,
highlight those qualifications that can be transitioned along the
various industries. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">For example, if
you&rsquo;ve managed people, no matter the type of business, you should
highlight this under your experience. Rather than not highlighting your
professional experience, even if it is not directly related to the job
you are seeking, you should consider writing a professional profile, or
summary at the start of your CV.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The summary will
allow you to address the career change by highlighting your skills and
how they relate to your career objective. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In addition,
this is one situation where it is OK to reference any volunteer or
community service work that you have done if it can help promote your
qualifications for the job. If you are fresh out of college, and
don&rsquo;t have much to bring to the table in terms of full time
professional experience, don&rsquo;t get discouraged in creating your
CV. Focus on highlighting your skills and your education. Avoid
using a professional profile, or summary. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Rather, list
your career objective and start the CV by listing your education.
Make sure to mention any awards or honors you received while in school.
Following your education, list all the skills that will qualify you for
the job you are seeking. Make sure to mention any courses, such as
project management or business communication that you have taken and
can apply at work. Instead of listing any experience, title the section
&ldquo;Previous professional Experience&rdquo; and divide it into
categories applicable to your career objective. For example, instead of
say that you spent a summer working at the Gap, use a sub-heading of
&ldquo;Customer Relations&rdquo; and list any responsibilities where
you have provided customer service. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Tap into any
community service, volunteer, or school club positions you have held in
order to highlight your abilities and showcase that you are the best
candidate for the job. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of not having the right
experience, or not having any professional experience to include in a
CV. Focus on what you can do rather than what you don&rsquo;t have
the experience in doing and you will have a winning CV.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">LISTING YOUR
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One of the
biggest concerns in creating a CV has to do with your professional
experience. Before you begin your CV, consider the following
titles: What is your career objective? Are you changing careers or
looking for professional growth? What experience have you had so far
that will help in meeting your professional goals? </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To get started
in developing your CV, list all of your previous experience, in
chronological order, starting with your latest job on a piece of paper.
List the dates of employment, your job title, the full company name and
the location of your employment. Now, consider just how much experience
you have had. In recent years, it has become more commonplace to change
jobs more frequently and not build your career in one place. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As such, it is
possible that someone with ten years of professional experience
following college has had over three jobs. That doesn&rsquo;t seem all
that much to include on a CV, right? Consider someone with over 30
years of experience. It is important to set limits on what you include
and what you can freely exclude from your CV under your
professional experience. Ideally, your CV should not exceed two
pages.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Depending on the
type of jobs you have held and your responsibilities, having only two
pages doesn&rsquo;t account for a lot of space. The best practice for
listing your experiences is not to exceed the most recent five jobs you
have held. Again, keep the mind the length of the CV when you are
deciding on the number of jobs you will list &ndash; if your last five
jobs and their accompanying responsibilities will take over one page
alone, than consider narrowing the experience down to the three most
recent positions you had. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Also, consider
the time you spent at each organization you have worked for &ndash;
list up to the last ten to fifteen years of experience. It is not
necessary to list every job you&rsquo;ve ever had to showcase your
qualifications and years of experience. If you have a long professional
career, focus on the last three to five jobs, but use the profile or
summary at the beginning of the CV to highlight the number of years
you have spent working, or the number of years you have spent in a
certain industry, acquiring specific skills. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When listing
your experiences, it is important that you do so in chronological order
without skipping any of the jobs you have held. While you may feel that
certain jobs are not particularly complimenting to your current career
objective you should not avoid listing them on your CV. Work on
highlighting the responsibilities that are transferable across various
industries. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Leaving any
unexplained gaps in your work history will raise titles by your
potential employer &ndash; thus don&rsquo;t create those gaps on your
CV by listing your experience out of order or by skipping jobs you
have had.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Finally, make
sure that your cover letter accounts for any additional qualifications
you would like to bring to the attention of your potential employer
that you didn&rsquo;t include on the CV. Your CV should be
concise, well written, and sell you as the best candidate for the job.
Just remember that it is quality over quantity that counts. </span><br
