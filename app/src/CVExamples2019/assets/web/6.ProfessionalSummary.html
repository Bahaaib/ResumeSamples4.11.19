 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How
To Write A Professional Summary For Your CV&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In today&rsquo;s
competitive job market, employers relay on well-written CVs
to&nbsp; screen potential candidates. In many instances, employers look
through job&nbsp; search web sites, such as HotJobs.com or Monster.com,
to find professionals&nbsp; with skills, education and experience that
fit their needs. These employment&nbsp; search web sites, along with
many companies&rsquo; own online applications, require&nbsp; candidates
to upload their CV in order to express interest in a specific&nbsp;
opportunity.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Without an
opportunity to send a personal email, or a cover letter, you have
to&nbsp; make sure that your CV expresses your personality in
addition to listing&nbsp; your professional and educational experiences
and achievements. To do so, you&nbsp; can include a professional
profile or summary at the beginning of your CV&nbsp; that allows
you to market yourself through a narrative. T</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">his section
allows your&nbsp; potential employers to learn something unique about
you and your career, as&nbsp; well as get a good feel of your
communication skills.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To write an
effective summary, you should first understand what information&nbsp;
should not be communicated in your CV. While a summary provides
an&nbsp; insight into what is unique and competitive about you, it is
not a place for you to&nbsp; indicate any personal information that
does not relate to your career. Information&nbsp; such as ethnicity,
marital status, sexual orientation, religious beliefs and&nbsp;
affiliations, etc. should be left out of your CV.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While
descriptive of who you are, this information is not relevant to
your&nbsp; potential employer in order to previous screen your
qualifications for their&nbsp; opportunity. Additionally, the summary
should not contain your previous&nbsp; professional experience, unless
you can clearly demonstrate how such&nbsp; background can be of value
in your future career development.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Beware of
generic statements, such as &ldquo;I am well organized and detail
oriented.&rdquo;&nbsp; Employers want to hear your unique voice and get
a sense of your&nbsp; communication skills while reading the summary
portion of your CV. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Using&nbsp;
generalizations about your abilities will make the employers believe
that you are&nbsp; either a poor communicator or are using such
statements to fill up space on your&nbsp; CV.&nbsp; Your summary
should be in form of a short paragraph or bullet statements,&nbsp;
containing only several sentences. There isn&rsquo;t a sentence limit,
but as a rule do&nbsp; not take up more than one quarter of the page. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your summary
should begin by a&nbsp; headline that summarizes your professional
title and/or your professional&nbsp; statement. Emphasize your title by
featuring the headline in bold and larger font,&nbsp; as it allows your
potential employer to grasp who you are quickly. For example:&nbsp;
Financial Planning Professional&nbsp; Achieved Double-Digit Return for
All Clients through Well-Balanced Financial&nbsp; Portfolios. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is important
that this title is well crafted, as it is the first impression
your&nbsp; potential employer will have of you.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are three
things a well-written summary should address:&nbsp; Your experiences
and skills as they relate to your idea job.&nbsp; What you can bring to
the organization and the open position that no other&nbsp; candidate
can.&nbsp; Your professional goals.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Even though your
CV summary is written by you, it should be composed in&nbsp; third
person, in present tense. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Think of it as a
summary of what one of your best&nbsp; colleagues would say about your
professional achievements. Reinforce your&nbsp; title, and sell only
the experiences and skills that meet your career objective. If&nbsp;
you have multiple career objectives, such as you wish to get a position
in either&nbsp; marketing or public relations, develop separate CV
summaries for each of&nbsp; the objectives.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A summary can
also contain a brief bullet section highlighting only a few vital&nbsp;
competitive skills that you bring to the table. An example of an
effective&nbsp; summary would be as follows:&nbsp; Successful financial
planning professional with over 15 years of personal and&nbsp;
retirement planning experience. Managed a small financial planning
firm, achieving double-digit financial returns for all clients by
developing personalized&nbsp; investment portfolios.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Leader in
development and professional growth of four&nbsp; other financial
planners in the firm through effective and motivating mentoring&nbsp;
strategies.&nbsp; Key competencies include:&nbsp; Personalized
portfolio development&nbsp; Financial forecasting&nbsp; Retirement
portfolio management&nbsp; Development on-going professional growth
strategies&nbsp; Much like your overall CV, your summary should be
well-written and error- free. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Make sure to
review your summary, and customize as necessary for the&nbsp; various
opportunities of interest. An effective summary will help you
&ldquo;hook&rdquo; your&nbsp; employer; it should sell you as a primary
candidate for the job, leaving your&nbsp; employer with a great first
impression of you.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">EMPLOYER
QUALIFICATIONS&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When applying
for jobs, it is important that you read through the job
description&nbsp; thoroughly before submitting your application. A lot
of what employers are&nbsp; actually looking for in their potential
associate is written right in the job&nbsp; description and
requirements. In fact, you should review your CV against&nbsp; the
requirements listed in order to make sure you have covered everything
the&nbsp; employer is looking for.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you can
address all the requirements by the&nbsp; information in your CV or
in your cover letter, you will be on the right track&nbsp; for getting
the job.&nbsp; However, there is a whole list of skills employers look
for that are never spelled&nbsp; out in the job description. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These skills are
typically referred to as employee&nbsp; ability skills, which are
skills beyond your technical knowledge and qualifications&nbsp; that
make you a great professional in your field. Don&rsquo;t panic, you
already have&nbsp; employee ability skills, you just may not think of
them as critical for getting a job.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The employee
ability skills have been grouped in eight categories:&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Communication
skills </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Teamwork skills </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Problem-solving
skills&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Initiative and
enterprise skills&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Planning and
organizing skills&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Self-management&nbsp;
</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Learning skills</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Technology
skills&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now that you
have read the categories, you are thinking to yourself, yes, I
have&nbsp; those skills. But did you ever think to list them on the CV?
Most people&nbsp; focus on their professional achievements and
responsibilities, and they often&nbsp; skip these skills in favor of
those that are job specific. However, more and more&nbsp; employers
look for these skills in CVs.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your potential
employer wants to know that you are a team player, that you&nbsp;
communicate well, and will show initiative when needed.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While you may
think&nbsp; this is implied by your interest in the available position,
employers like to see&nbsp; these skills called out on your CV or
cover letter.&nbsp; The best way to demonstrate these skills is through
your experience and under&nbsp; your qualifications. Point out the
initiatives you have participated in that required&nbsp; you to work in
a team, under a deadline, or as a self-starter. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Demonstrate
your&nbsp; loyalty through pointing out your accomplishments at an
organization and how&nbsp; they benefited your team as a whole (not
just you).&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You can showcase
the employee ability skills in your cover letter by openly&nbsp;
showing your enthusiasm for the available position, stating your
commitment to&nbsp; your career objective, indicating your motivation
and your integrity, and showing&nbsp; that you are above all unselfish
and credible.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These skills are
just as critical to your ability to do a great job as your&nbsp;
professional experience and education &ndash; employers are looking for
someone&nbsp; who will be a great fit on their team and in their
organization, someone who&nbsp; works well under pressure but also has
a sense of humor and has a balance&nbsp; between their personal and
professional life.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Review your
existing CV. Does it contain any employee ability skills? If
not,&nbsp; make revisions to incorporate those employee ability skills
you feel you excel in.&nbsp; If you are unsure, ask your friends or
family for an objective opinion, so that you&nbsp; can get a better
idea of how people around you see you as a person as well as&nbsp; a
professional.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Keep these
attributes in mind as you compose your CV and your cover letter,
and especially as you are taking part in interviews. These skills can
make&nbsp; a difference between knowing how to do a job and being
qualified to exceed&nbsp; goals and grow in your career.&nbsp; </span><br

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">HOW TO DESIGN
YOUR CV TO GET EMPLOYERS ATTENTION&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Job hunting can
be one of the most exhilarating and yet one of the most&nbsp; agonizing
experiences in your life. While you look forward to the new chapter
in&nbsp; your professional life, finding a way to stand out from other
candidates, who are&nbsp; at least equally qualified for the position
you want, is a difficult task.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your CV is
the first contact your potential employer has with you. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A well&nbsp;
formatted and a well-written CV can make a difference between
getting the&nbsp; interview and getting the job, and being passed over.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Most employers
receive a&nbsp; stack of CVs of qualified candidates and scan them
quickly before they&nbsp; decide whether or not hey want to read
further.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You only have a
few seconds to&nbsp; make a lasting impression. Don&rsquo;t panic.
Instead, focus on the design of your&nbsp; CV as it is the first
thing your employer, whether on paper or in electronic&nbsp;
form.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The most
commonly made mistake in CV design include using templates that are
already available in Microsoft Word. While these templates provide
a&nbsp; quick, easy to follow tools to create your CV, they are
outdated, and they&nbsp; will make your CV appear generic and
uninviting. Additionally, these&nbsp; templates, while well formatted
in Microsoft Word, will not translate well when&nbsp; emailed or
uploaded to job search engine web sites.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Second most
commonly made mistake in CV design is inclusion of graphics&nbsp;
on the page. Your picture and/or any other graphics are not appropriate
for a&nbsp; CV. Including anything outside of plain text will make
you stand out in a way&nbsp; that makes the employer think you are not
taking yourself seriously as a&nbsp; professional, and this is
certainly not the first impression you want to make. You&nbsp; can find
samples of CVs on the Internet; search for CVs by your&nbsp;
industry to find the templates that make most sense for the job you are
seeking.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Than work on a
blank page to replicate the look and feel of the CV you like. The
following are basic formatting rules for your CV: Limit the length
of the CV to two pages. The page should have one-inch margins, top
and bottom, right and left. Use left justification only &ndash; as a
rule, do not center the content of your&nbsp; CV.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The font and
font size should be consistent.&nbsp; The bullet points should be basic
&ndash; use circles or squares, but never any&nbsp; symbols that may
not translate well when you email your CV to your&nbsp; potential
employer.&nbsp; Headlines can be in all caps; the remaining text should
not have special&nbsp; formatting. Do not underline any of the
information in your CV. In the world of&nbsp; Internet driven job
applications, underlining in a document implies a web&nbsp; link.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The font size
for headlines should not exceed 14 points; the remainder of&nbsp; the
text in the CV should not exceed 12 points.&nbsp; Use the Tab key
instead of the Space bar to create spaces between the&nbsp; text in
your CV.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As a last
formatting check point, ask your friends or your family for help
in&nbsp; reviewing your CV. Send the CV file via email to a few
of your friends &ndash;&nbsp; ask them to review the CV and make
sure nothing seems out of place. Print&nbsp; out the CV on paper
and review to make sure that margins are accurately&nbsp; set, and that
the content doesn&rsquo;t appear crowded on the page. Keep in mind
&ndash;&nbsp; when it comes to your CV, sleek simple appearance,
and great writing, will&nbsp; get you the job you are
seeking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">ACTION WORDS TO
GIVE YOUR CV POWER&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You&rsquo;ve
heard it over and over again &ndash; a well-written CV is a
winning&nbsp; CV. What does that mean? How can you determine
whether your CV is&nbsp; written in a tone and style that employers
will respond to?</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Synthesizing
your&nbsp; educational achievements, years of your professional
experience, and&nbsp; numerous qualifications you have acquired over
the years into one to two pages&nbsp; is not easy to accomplish.&nbsp;
Every phrase or statement you write has to convince your potential
employer&nbsp; that you are the best candidate for the job. To do so,
you will need to use action&nbsp; or power word.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Action words, or
power words, are keywords (verbs) that add strength and&nbsp; positive
implication to your job responsibilities or qualifications.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When you&nbsp;
submit your CV to your potential employer, there are two scenarios
that will&nbsp; occur. One, your application will be ran through a
computer software program,&nbsp; which searches your CV for key
terms as indicated by the employer. If your&nbsp; CV contains those
key words, your CV will be pulled aside for further&nbsp;
review.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Two, a hiring
manager, or most often a human resources associate, will receive&nbsp;
a stack or CVs and scan through them quickly to pick out those that
stand&nbsp; out the most, again based on certain key words. It should
now be clear why&nbsp; these action words are critical to your success
in job hunting.&nbsp; When listing your employment history, each
job&rsquo;s responsibilities should be&nbsp; listed in bullet point
form, with each statement starting with an action word.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Using power
verbs or phrases will indicate to your employer that you are
driven&nbsp; by action and results, and that you can effectively
articulate your professional&nbsp; experience (thus, showcasing your
communication skills).&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Here is a small
sample of action words:&nbsp; Created&nbsp; Developed and
Implemented&nbsp; Managed&nbsp; Delivered&nbsp; Designed&nbsp;
Facilitated Negotiated&nbsp; Coordinated Budgeted&nbsp; Acted&nbsp;
Communicated Consulted, etc.&nbsp; This is a very short sampling of
action words. Many resources on the Internet&nbsp; contain extensive
listings of action words or phrases. Do some research and&nbsp; use
only those terms that are relevant to your field of experience.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your best
bet&nbsp; would be to locate samples of CVs by professionals in
your industry. Review&nbsp; those CVs for ideas on how to list your
responsibilities.&nbsp; Important note: do not copy exact statements
from another persons CV;&nbsp; while you can do your research, you
will want to make your CV&nbsp; personalized to your professional
experience.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Don&rsquo;t fall
into the trap of using the same action word over and over. If you
have&nbsp; in fact managed multiple projects, you may want to be a bit
more specific about&nbsp; your role in each. For example, maybe you
were the communication liaison in&nbsp; one project, while you were the
project manager for another task. Begin the first&nbsp; bullet point
with &ldquo;communicated,&rdquo; and the second bullet point with
&ldquo;managed.&rdquo;&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However, be
aware of the words that you are using and consider their value in&nbsp;
your CV. Do not go overboard with using varying terms, especially
those&nbsp; that may change your role or your responsibilities.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Additionally,
you can find key action words in job descriptions. Review your&nbsp; CV
against a job description and make sure that all required
qualifications&nbsp; are addressed in your statements. This will also
help you identify action words&nbsp; that the employer uses, which you
can in turn use to customize your CV or cover letter to that
specific job.&nbsp; Always make sure that you are consistent in the way
you list all of your&nbsp; responsibilities and qualifications, and
make sure that your statements exude&nbsp; positive attitude and focus
on actions and results. By doing so, you are&nbsp; guaranteed to create
a winning CV that will get you noticed.</span><br

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">STATING YOUR
RESPONSIBILITIES ON YOUR JOB DESCRIPTIONS&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you have
never written a CV, the blank page you are facing can be very&nbsp;
intimidating. While you can describe your job responsibilities to your
friends,&nbsp; listing them out in a CV and showcasing how your
experience to date meets&nbsp; your career objectives is a very
difficult task.&nbsp; To get started, you must first consider what type
of a job you are seeking.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Much&nbsp; like
your career objective or summery should reflect your professional
goals,&nbsp; your current and past experiences must showcase that you
are the best&nbsp; candidate for the job you are applying for. In
listing your current and past&nbsp; professional experiences, try to
focus on those responsibilities that indicate you&nbsp; are qualified
to take the next step in your career. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Due to the fact
that more and more companies as well as job search sites use&nbsp;
scanning software to pick out candidates, it is very important that you
use key&nbsp; words, including active verbs, to describe your skills.
Instead of beginning your&nbsp; job descriptions with
&ldquo;Responsible for&rdquo; try to use active verbs such as:&nbsp;
Managed&nbsp; Developed&nbsp; Created&nbsp; Communicated
Interfaced&nbsp; Achieved, etc.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These key words
get straight to the point of describing your responsibilities,&nbsp;
which is exactly what the employers are looking for. Chose these words
carefully&nbsp; &ndash; don&rsquo;t say that you &ldquo;managed a
project&rdquo;, implying you were responsible for the&nbsp; whole task
from start to finish if you were only responsibly for
communicating&nbsp; the project to other associates. Instead state that
you &ldquo;Developed and executed&nbsp; the communication strategy for
associates,&rdquo; describing your role more&nbsp; accurately and
emphasizing your strengths.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Typically, the
first job listed on your CV is the one you currently hold. In
this&nbsp; case, make sure that your responsibilities are stated in
present tense, as you&nbsp; are still responsible for them. For
example, say &ldquo;Manage accounting activities&rdquo;&nbsp; instead
of &ldquo;Managed accounting activities.&rdquo; This will indicate to
your potential&nbsp; employer what your day-to-day activities are like
and how they compliment&nbsp; responsibilities of the job you are
submitting your CV for. All previous jobs&nbsp; should be listed
using past tense, and should start with active verbs such as&nbsp;
managed, developed, accomplished, etc.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Additionally,
make sure that responsibilities you are listing are relevant for
to&nbsp; your career objective. List only those responsibilities which
help you put your&nbsp; best foot forward. For example, if you are
looking for a job that requires&nbsp; managing a team of people, focus
on your development and participation in&nbsp; group projects instead
of focusing on solitary activities such as office&nbsp; organization. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In terms of
formatting, make sure that your responsibilities are listed in
bullet&nbsp; points. This formatting is preferred to paragraphs on a CV
because it is&nbsp; easier to review quickly. Employers simply
scan the CVs and look for key&nbsp; words &ndash; if the CV
looks overwhelming, with a lot of copy and poor&nbsp; formatting, they
will likely discard it. Thus, it is very important that your CV
is&nbsp; formatted with enough white space and doesn&rsquo;t contain
any errors.&nbsp; </span><br

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">HIGHLIGHTING
YOUR EDUCATION AND JOB SKILLS:</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">For Entry
Level&nbsp; Graduating from college is one of the proudest moments you
can experience.&nbsp; Receiving your diploma validates all the hard
work you put into your education,&nbsp; the all nights you pulled
before exams. Your graduation signifies your&nbsp; accomplishments as a
student, and opens the door into the world of career&nbsp; choices, job
searches, and 40-hour workweeks.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">All of a sudden,
it hits you &ndash;&nbsp; how will you get a job that requires
experience if you have none?&nbsp; As a recent college graduate, you
are entering the workforce at entry-level jobs.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your potential
employers have very reasonable expectations. They expect you&nbsp; to
have graduated from college and that your major is in line with the job
you are&nbsp; applying for. They anticipate that you have some
experience, a summer job or&nbsp; an internship, but they are not
requiring years of professional experience. They&nbsp; would like to
see some references &ndash; from your professors or previous&nbsp;
supervisors &ndash; so that they can get a better idea of your
personality and work&nbsp; ethic. Sound reasonable so far?&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The best way to
show your potential employer that you are a perfect candidate&nbsp; for
the job is to create a functional CV. Functional CVs focus on
your&nbsp; qualifications, not your career time line. This style of the
CV highlights what&nbsp; skills you have, rather than where and
when you acquired or utilize them. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In&nbsp; other
words, instead of listing your experiences by your job titles, your
CV&nbsp; will contained sections titled by your skills such as
verbal and written&nbsp; communication, customer satisfaction, project
management, etc. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This CV
style is highly recommended for and most often used by college
students&nbsp; seeking internships or their first jobs out of
college.&nbsp; Begin your CV by stating your career objective. Make
sure that your career&nbsp; goals are personal. Your objective should
be specific to the position you want,&nbsp; and should indicate to your
employer how you intend to utilize your education&nbsp; and how this
position will help you develop your experience. Your education&nbsp;
should be listed next. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">List the school
you attend and its location, your graduation&nbsp; year, and your
major. It can be helpful to include your GPA, specific courses
you&nbsp; have taken, or any honors you have received while in
school.&nbsp; Your professional skills should come next.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This section
will include sub-headings&nbsp; as they relate to specific
qualifications you want to promote, such as&nbsp; communications,
customer relations, managements, etc. Here, you can utilize&nbsp; any
experience you have that relates to the sub-sections, including your
part&nbsp; time jobs, internships, volunteer positions, community
service work, or school- related activities. Only include a work
experience/work history section if you&nbsp; have held part time jobs
while in school or have had internships you&rsquo;d like your&nbsp;
employer to know about.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This list should
only include dates, titles, companies, and locations without&nbsp;
listing any of your responsibilities, since you are covering them in
the previous&nbsp; section. If you belonged to any clubs in school,
include a section for activities&nbsp; and list only those that support
your career objective. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">For example, if
you were an editor of your school paper, and you are trying to get a
job at a publishing&nbsp; company, make sure that you include this
experience in your CV.&nbsp; Your last section should list
references. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As a new
graduate, it is to your benefit&nbsp; to include references on your CV,
and give your employer everything they&nbsp; need to consider
you as a qualified candidate for the job. You have nothing to&nbsp;
lose by providing this information ahead of being asked for it.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Before you start
applying for jobs, take advantage of your school&rsquo;s career
center&nbsp; and have one of the mentors there review your CV and
help you perfect&nbsp; both the content and the format. With a
well-written CV, you are prepared to&nbsp; take the professional
world by storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br
