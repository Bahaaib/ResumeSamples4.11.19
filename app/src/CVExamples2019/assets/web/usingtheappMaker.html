      Welcome!<br>
      <br>
      This app contains a superb, easy to use CV Maker as well as
      valuable information about writing your CV. You are welcome to use
      as much or as little of it as you like.<br>
      <br>
      It's a good idea to go through the information about CVs, first.
      This gives you valuable help about how to write your CV. The
      information is below the CV Maker button.&nbsp; You can go
      straight to the CV Maker, if you wish.<br>
      <br>
      Click on the menu item called CV Maker to start creating your CV.
      It is simple to use. Remember, you can download your CV to your
      phone or tablet or you can email it to yourself or anyone
      else.&nbsp; The CV should save to your Download folder. Files can
      sometimes be difficult to find on mobile devices so just email it
      to yourself if you cannot find it after downloading.<br>
      <br>
      The CV will save as a Word file (.doc) so that you can use your
      desktop computer to make it even better, if you wish. Remember to
      save it as a PDF when you have finished editing it on your desktop
      to send to employers.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      There are a selection of CV Templates in this app for you to use.
      We will be adding more - so please keep this app on your device
      and check back for updates.<br>
      <br>
      This app is is in Beta mode which means we have completely
      redeveloped it and you are one of the first people to use it.
      Please send us your feedback if you get any problems so we can fix
      things. We'd love to hear from you :) There's a Contact Developer
      page lower down the app.<br>
      <br>

      Play. We'd really appreciate it.<br>
      <br>
      Good luck with your job hunting.<br>
