      As people age, they often let their fitness slip. The pressures of
      a job(s), spouse, and kids often take precedence over working out.
      If you are tired of the way you have let your body slip, then
      follow these fitness tips listed below. They will help you get
      into the shape you were in when you were a teenager.<br>

      A great way to build your endurance for long distance running is
      to adopt the strategy used by East African runners. Start off
      slowly for the first third of your run, then go at a normal pace
      for the second third, and go at your fast pace to finish your run.<br>
      <br>
      Increase your ability to jump. Stand at the bottom of a set of
      stairs, and jump back and forth from the bottom step to the floor.
      Continue this until you feel comfortable jumping at that height.
      Once you are, move to something higher. Always make sure what you
      are jumping on is stable and secure.<br>
      <br>
      A good way to try and recover faster is to work out the muscles
      that you had worked out the previous day, but lightly instead.
      This will act like stretching your muscles and will make blood
      travel faster through your muscles which will in turn deliver more
      nutrients to them.<br>
      <br>
      When working out, use this order: dumbbells first, then barbells,
      then machines. This is because your small stabilizing muscles tire
      more quickly than your large muscles. Dumbbells and barbells
      require more use of these smaller stabilizing muscles, you should
      use them first and move onto machines, which rely more on your
      larger muscles instead.<br>
      <br>
      Taking hikes is a good way to improve many aspects of fitness.
      Hiking will improve strength in ones legs as well as improving
      ones cardiovascular system. Hiking can also have the added benefit
      of being a good stress reliever. Also one can adjust the
      difficulty by adding or removing weight in a backpack.<br>
      <br>
      The best way to build up your forehand strength for use with
      sports like tennis and racquetball is to do exercises with a
      crumpled newspaper. To do this properly, lay the paper flat on a
      surface. Start at a corner and crumple it into a ball shape with
      your dominant hand for about 30 seconds. Do the exact same with
      the other hand.<br>
      <br>
      A good tip to stay fit, is to try circuit training. Circuit
      training is a method of lifting weights where you dramatically
      reduce the rest time and the weight. This method turns your weight
      lifting session into a cardio session at the same time, so you can
      kill two birds with one stone.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, these tips show that getting back into shape is not as
      hard as you may think. All it takes is a little time, dedication,
      work, and patience. These are important characteristics not just
      for working out, but for life as well. If you can be successful at
      parenting, being married, and at your job, then there is no reason
      why you can't be successful with your fitness goals. So get out
      there and do it!<br>

      Fitness generally refers to two different topics, nutrition and
      exercise. Both of these are essential aspects to having a healthy
      life and when you are able to improve them, you will begin to feel
      better about yourself and others will begin to respect you more.
      Fitness is not just about looking great, but more importantly, it
      is about feeling great. The following tips will help you with just
      that.<br>
      <br>
      A good fitness tip for people who are overweight is to concentrate
      on getting more fit rather than becoming more skinny. Concentrate
      on getting in top shape, as it is a better indicator of a healthy
      person than how much, he or she weighs. The pounds will come off
      eventually.<br>
      <br>
      Stop making excuses for not working out. Schedule a block of time
      to workout tomorrow, even if it's only for 15 minutes. Tomorrow,
      schedule another block of time for the next day. Do this daily and
      eventually you won't need to make that appointment with yourself
      and your workout time will increase. Soon, exercise will just be
      part of a normal day.<br>
      <br>
      Kids need exercise just as much as adults. If you want to get your
      kids moving, turn on music. Dancing is a great way to get
      exercise. You can give them moves to do, or have them make up
      their own. See if your child can hop on one foot through a whole
      song.<br>
      <br>
      Do not be a single-machine user. Exercising in many different
      forms is the best way to do strength training, even if you want to
      focus on one part of your body. Overall strength and health is
      more important than getting bigger biceps, so try your best to be
      as diverse as possible.<br>
      <br>
      As with most fitness and health plans the saying is, "Keep your
      eye on the GI." This means to eat foods that are low on the
      glycemic index. These types of foods include things like
      multigrain bread, oats, dried fruit, apples, citrus fruits, sweet
      potatoes or sweet corn. Many things that people would not think of
      as healthy, but are very good for you and also quite delicious.<br>
      <br>
      You can build up your physical strength through the use of lighter
      weights. Your muscles will have just as much force as when you
      lift heavier weights, except you will be going much slower. These
      are especially great for bench-presses. Go with about 40-60% of
      what you usually lift and do 8 sets of 12 repetitions pushing the
      weight up quickly. Have a 30 second rest period between sets.<br>
      <br>
      When lifting weights, start small. Trying to lift too much can
      cause injury, and if your weights are even slightly too heavy, you
      won't be able to do as many reps. Aim for lifting smaller amounts
      over a longer period of time to help build your muscles and your
      stamina.<br>
      <br>
      If you can integrate even just two of these tips into your daily
      life, you will begin to see significant change. This will begin to
      spread to all aspects of your life as you start to have more
      confidence. As you have seen from this article, fitness is not
      about sacrifice, but rather about using our bodies in the way they
      were meant to be used.<br>
