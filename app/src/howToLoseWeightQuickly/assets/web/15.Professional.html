      Setting a huge goal like running a marathon or losing 100 pounds
      may not be the best way to get fit. These goals can feel
      overwhelming and cause you to give up when you don't see instant
      results. Instead, set small, attainable goals that you can
      gradually incorporate into your lifestyle.<br>
      <br>
      Setting goals for one to reach is an important tool to assist one
      in maintaining fitness levels. Depending on individuals desired
      goals can very from getting faster to getting stronger and all
      kinds of levels in between. However, the most useful thing about a
      goal is that it gives one something to aim for.<br>

      Aerobic training greatly reduces the risk of cardiovascular
      disease and helps maintain a healthy cardiovascular system. You
      should have a schedule for aerobic or cardiovascular exercise, and
      you should stick to that schedule. Three days a week at an hour a
      day is good, or you can choose to do thirty minutes to an hour
      daily. It is up to you, but you should always incorporate
      cardiovascular exercise into your routine.<br>

      Learn about vitamins and supplements. Do not overuse them. Find
      out what your diet is missing and complete it with supplements or
      vitamins. Keep a close watch on the products you take and the
      effects they have on you. Make sure you do not take too many
      supplements: this could cause you to gain weight.<br>
      <br>
      Make a playlist of songs that get you pumped up for your workout.
      Listening to fast, upbeat music while working out on the treadmill
      or elliptical will help you keep the pace needed to stay in the
      zone of a good aerobic workout. Find music that makes you want to
      get up and dance and move to keep your heart beat up and your mind
      focused.<br>

      A part of getting in shape the is sometimes overlooked is changing
      your eating habits. A lot of people start a workout and even
      though they stick to it, they notice they aren't losing any
      weight. Sometimes this is because they are still eating the same
      unhealthy food they were before the workouts began. Take a good
      look at what you're consuming and you'll probably find that some
      changes are in order.<br>
      <br>
      If you're just starting to workout, train then drink a pint of
      protein shake or milk. According to a new study, beginners that
      used three sets of six exercises and drank a pint of protein
      immediately after training to failure, gained 5 lbs of muscle
      within just 8 weeks.<br>

      A great fitness tip is to make sure you get the right running
      shoes. It's not wise to run in shoes that aren't specifically
      designed for running because you can get seriously injured. You
      can easily sprain your ankle. Good running shoes are well worth
      the money.<br>

      If your fitness routine is not what it could be, give it some pep
      and pour on the spice, with some effective tips that make sense.
      Keep yourself motivated with some of the sound advice you can find
      in this article. Make your fitness routine all that it can be.<br>

      You will not lose fat by only working out your abdominal muscles.
      Studies have shown that it takes around 250,000 crunches to burn
      just one pound of fat. That is the equivalent of you doing 100
      crunches everyday for 7 years straight. Instead of doing all that
      work, have a variety of areas targeted in your workout and you
      will see more instantaneous results.<br>
      <br>
      With most popular chain restaurants offering massive servings of
      almost all menu items, it is important to be careful about how
      much food you consume in a single sitting. Though it can certainly
      be tempting to clean your plate when dining out, it is much wiser
      to divide your entree at least in half before you begin to eat,
      and immediately pack the remainder to take home for the following
      day's lunch.<br>
      <br>
      Have a timer handy when doing exercises at home. When using an
      exercise ball it is helpful to time each exercise so you know how
      long you are in each position. Holding each position for a
      specified length of time helps you build muscles and reach your
      fitness goals.<br>
      <br>
      Having trouble keeping up with your exercise? If you only train in
      a gym, that might be part of the reason why. Try some outdoor
      exercising so that you can enjoy fresh air and nature. This will
      invigorate your workout routine and breath new life into your
      commitment to fitness.<br>
      <br>
      Doing work outs that involve jerks or lunges can be very
      beneficial but can also be very dangerous to your spine. When
      bringing any heavy object over your head, you should clench your
      butt muscles together. This will ensure that you body has
      stabilized the spinal region and reduce injury.<br>
      <br>
      A modification to traditional running that can increase fitness is
      high knee running. It simply involves raising your knees above
      your waist while running. By doing high knee running, you increase
      strength in your core muscles by essentially doing a standing
      crunch while running. It's also an extra workout for your thighs.<br>
      <br>
      Keeping your body fit is about making choices on a daily or even
      hourly basis. A fundamental rule of thumb to remain fit is to keep
      a glass of water with you wherever you go and drink plenty of it.
      Water flushes your digestive tract of unwanted toxins as well as
      keeping the body from feeling hungry.<br>
      <br>
      It's important to find your personal target heart rate. This will
      assure you're getting your heart rate up high enough, but not too
      high. Take your age away from 220 and that is your maximum heart
      rate level. If you are doing low to moderate-intensity exercise,
      your heart rate should be at 60 to 75 percent of your max heart
      rate. If you are doing high intensity exercises, you should be at
      80 percent to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate level.<br>
