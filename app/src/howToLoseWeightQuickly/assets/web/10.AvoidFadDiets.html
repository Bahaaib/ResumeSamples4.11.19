      Your weight is an important factor in your social, romantic, and
      physical life on a day to day basis. Sooner or later, you will
      have to decide if you need to begin focusing on losing a few
      pounds and moving towards a healthier, more successful you. When
      you do, the information here will help guide you along the path
      and reach your destination a little bit quicker.<br>
      <br>
      One great way to lose weight if you are at work is to take the
      stairs instead of the elevator. It's a simple tip, but it really
      works. It you work on the 10th floor and it takes about 30 second
      to go up a flight of stairs, it will take you only 5 minutes to
      get to your destination. The wait and travel time for an elevator
      will probably close to that, if not longer.<br>
      <br>
      Eat plenty of salad, but be careful with the salad dressing! By
      adding a couple of tablespoons of salad dressing, you have
      transformed your low-fat food into a high-fat meal. Simply dress
      the salad with a little flavored vinegar and a touch of oil, or
      use a purchased non-fat or low-fat dressing. Beware of high-fat
      extras such as cheese, bacon bits, or croutons.<br>
      <br>
      Setting realistic goals will help you lose weight. If you set
      goals that are way out of your reach (like losing 10 pounds in one
      week) it will leave you feeling discouraged and like you can't
      lose weight, and most likely you will give up. Just take your time
      and keep a good mind set.<br>
      <br>
      Make sure to eat slowly. Most people eat too quickly. If you slow
      down the speed you eat by setting down your fork between bites or
      holding a conversation, you will more readily recognize when you
      are full. This means you are less likely to overeat while you wait
      for your stomach to catch up with the food you've already eaten.<br>
      <br>
      When on a weight loss plan, plate your food in the kitchen before
      sitting down to eat instead of serving food "family style" at the
      table. You are more likely to plate smaller portions and wait
      before adding food to your plate. By waiting you allow time to
      feel full.<br>
      <br>
      For weight loss, look for new recipes. You might have to replace
      certain ingredients that would be too rich for your diet. For
      instance, you can replace all sorts of creams with silken tofu.
      Experiment with the recipes you already know and learn new ones
      that you can easily adapt to your needs.<br>
      <br>
      When striving to lose weight, it is important not to compete with
      others. Each person is different and by comparing yourself to
      others motivation could be lost. It is also important to note that
      each person loses weight differently, and therefore, it is not
      practical to compare yourself to other people.<br>
      <br>
      To help you lose weight, try to set up a diet that is as natural
      as possible. Remove as many processed foods as you can from your
      diet. This will help you reduce your caloric intake while
      increasing the quality of the foods you eat. In this way, you will
      remain healthy while losing weight.<br>
      <br>
      You should make the habit of eating three times a day, at the same
      time every day. This will help you stay away from snacks and also
      help you reduce the quantity of food that you eat. Eat in the
      morning, around noon and around nine in the evening for better
      results.<br>
      <br>
      Allow yourself a treat. Deprivation is one of the biggest causes
      of weight loss failure. When you completely deprive yourself of
      foods you love, it can often lead to a binge if your resolve
      weakens. Instead of completely eliminating your favorite junk
      foods, allow yourself a small amount as a treat once in a while.
      Moderation is the key here - a single cookie instead of the whole
      package will satisfy your sweet tooth without spoiling your diet.<br>
      <br>
      No two people can follow the exact same pattern, but these tips
      that are offered above, are great for nearly any size and
      lifestyle. You can find a way to adjust the routines and fit
      yourself into a schedule that results in looking and feeling
      better, than ever before. It is never too late to start dropping a
      pants' size.<br>
