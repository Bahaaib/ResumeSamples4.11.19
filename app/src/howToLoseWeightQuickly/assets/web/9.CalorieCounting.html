          By Calorie Counting</span></big><br>
      <big>
        <br>
        One way that you can come to lose weight quickly is to calorie
        count.
        What does this mean for you? This means that you keep a careful
        count
        of how many calories you consume, every day, in order to make
        sure that
        you don't take in more calories than you burn off.<br>
        <br>
        To lose weight quickly, and to keep it off both for the short
        term and
        the long term, it is important too calorie count, as well as to
        exercise regularly and to eat a diet that is low in saturated
        fat.<br>
        <br>
        The best part about calorie counting is that it can be done by
        anyone.
        It doesnâ€™t matter whether you are male or female, where you
        live, or whether or not you wish to lose weight quickly or have
        plenty
        of time to devote to losing it.<br>
        <br>
        The concept behind calorie counting is that you can eat whatever
        you
        choose, but you have to make sure that you exercise sufficiently
        to get
        rid of those calories. Your energy output must be greater than
        your
        food input. You are not allowed to have any extra calories
        hanging
        around that can easily turn to fat! It stands to reason then
        that
        calorie counting must be accompanied by consistent exercise.<br>
        <br>
        Calorie counting forces you to take a closer look at the foods
        you
        consume on a daily basis. You also will become acquainted with
        the
        quantity of calories each food contains. This is something that
        might
        be very surprising for you. It can be a real eye opener but will
        lead
        to you becoming more conscientious. Another important
        consideration
        when it comes to the idea of how to lose weight quickly is you
        need to
        learn how many calories you need in order to function at your
        best.<br>
        <br>
        How do you begin to calorie count your way to a slimmer, and
        more toned
        physique? To start, you first need to figure out how many
        calories you
        require to maintain a stable and healthy weight. For both sexes
        there
        is a general guideline to go by. For example, females require
        approximately 2000 calories on a daily basis while males require
        more
        (an estimated 2500 calories per day). Keep in mind that other
        important
        considerations are your build, your height, and how much muscle
        you
        have on your body when you first start the calorie counting
        plan.<br>
        <br>
        Once you have this figured out, you can then devise a plan that
        is
        appropriate for you. Let's look at a concrete example of this:<br>
        <br>
        If you take in less than 500 calories of what you require on a
        daily
        basis, then your weight loss will be roughly one pound a week.
        If you
        increase this to bringing in less than 1,000 calories then you
        will
        lose an average of two pounds weekly. Sound good?<br>
        <br>
        Why does this work so well? If you want to lose weight quickly,
        then
        you want to consume fewer calories, than you need to, in order
        that
        your body will then need to turn to your fat stores to make up
        the
        difference.<br>
