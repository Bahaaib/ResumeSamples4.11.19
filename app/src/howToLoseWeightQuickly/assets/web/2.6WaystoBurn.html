      <p>There seems to be an unlimited number of ways fitness
        professionals and personal trainers claim that you can easily
        lose
        weight. While losing weight is a multi-dimensional process that
        does
        rely on a number of factors, there really are very few
        tried-and-true
        strategies, that when used, absolutely result in fat reduction
        and
        weight-loss that is beyond the scope of common weight-loss
        programming.
        These few strategies are not common and they are not widely
        used.
        However, when incorporated into your fitness program, these
        strategies
        will exceed your weight loss and fat burn expectations every
        single
        time.</p>
      <p>I have compiled this list to help you understand exactly how
        these strategies work, how they work best when they are all used
        together and how you can incorporate them into your daily life
        and
        routine without much effort at all.</p>
      <p><b>1. Zig-zag your calories for immediate and long-term
          results</b></p>
      <p>Body builders have used this method for decades but somehow
        the fitness industry, in large part, has missed the boat. The
        common
        answer to the question, "what do I do to burn fat and lose
        weight" is,
        "reduce your calories." While this may work, it is likely
        short-lived
        success. You see, most people have a considerable amount of body
        fat
        they'd like to shed and that could take some time. So, if you
        have a
        person start reducing their calories from their current level,
        the
        likelihood of them quickly reaching their caloric minimum (in
        most
        cases 1,200 calories/day) is quite high. Once they reach this
        very low
        caloric level, their metabolism tends to slow, their results
        stop
        completely and because their body is deprived of nutrition, this
        person
        tends to give in to temptation and binges on trash foods for a
        few days
        before regaining self-control or they just fall off the wagon
        completely and give up. Neither of these outcomes is worth the
        effort,
        so let's do it right.</p>
      <p>The best way that I have found to begin a diet is to raise the
        metabolism by feeding the body more food. Yes more! Now I'm not
        proposing you simply eat food for the sake of eating more
        calories, I'm
        talking about quality foods, and a lot of them, being eaten in
        the
        right amounts and in 3-4 hour intervals throughout the day.
        Exact meal
        composition is outside the scope of this article and therefore I
        will
        not discuss that issue further except to say that meal
        composition is a
        vital importance and should be designed carefully. By increasing
        the
        quantity (or bulk) of food, our bodies must work hard to digest
        all of
        this and the metabolism must therefore speed up to handle the
        workload.
        This initial increase in food quantity is the start of our
        zig-zag
        method. Each person's caloric requirement is different and their
        overall calories may stay the same or in some cases increase,
        but the
        point is not necessarily to concern ourselves with calories (for
        now)
        as much as we are concerned with eating quality foods, in proper
        proportion at frequent intervals throughout the day in order to
        prime
        the metabolism as a fat-burning furnace. Eating in this manner
        makes it
        difficult for most people to eat too many calories. Given this I
        admit
        that calories are a factor, but are secondary, at this point, to
        increasing quality food intake.</p>
      <p>Once a person has met this requirement and is eating quality
        foods, in proper proportion spread throughout five or preferably
        six
        meals each day, their metabolism will rise allowing them more
        "wiggle-room" as they progress. This initial technique is done
        so that
        they are allowed more caloric space as they inevitably begin to
        reduce
        food portion sizes (and calories) as the days and weeks
        progress. I use
        this method on my client's diet plans and I monitor their
        sensations of
        hunger very carefully. Within a few days, the amount of food
        that
        initially filled them completely will soon be less than
        satisfactory as
        they will inevitably experience hunger pangs as their metabolism
        rises.</p>
      <p>At this point calories (portion sizes) should be reduced just
        slightly each week for about three to four weeks. By this time
        the
        metabolism will be running on high and they'll be anticipating
        their
        next meal even though they are still eating the same number of
        meals
        (preferably six) each day. Their weight and body fat percentage
        will
        likely drop considerably during this time and they'll be
        motivated to
        continue eating in this manner because of the great result.
        However,
        their body can't just continue to reduce calories (and portions)
        forever. If this did occur the metabolism would eventually drop
        again
        and results would stop. So after the three-week mark, maximum of
        four
        weeks, we zig-zag our food quantity (and therefore calories)
        once again
        by significantly increasing portion sizes. We would not increase
        them
        all the way back up to the portion sizes we began the process
        with but
        portion sizes do need to rise considerably. I tend to take my
        clients
        portions sizes up fifty percent of the difference from where
        their food
        quantity is now to where their zig-zag started. Once this
        temporary
        increase takes place I recommend a person maintain this food
        intake
        level for five days before once again beginning to slowly and
        systematically reduce portion sizes (and calories) over the
        coming days
        and weeks until they reach the three to four-week mark once
        again in
        which case it would then be time to initiate another zig-zag.</p>
      <p>This strategy will absolutely work every single time if
        implemented properly and with care. The tendency is for people
        to
        resist raising their calories and portion sizes because they are
        losing
        so much weight and body fat. However, the periodic (every three
        to four
        weeks) increase is absolutely necessary for the process to
        continue
        long-term without setbacks.</p>
      <p><b>2. Begin and end your day with very low carbohydrates</b></p>
      <p>This is a method that will benefit you immensely and almost
        instantly. Beginning your day with a first meal consisting of
        primarily
        quality proteins will ensure you maintain your muscle mass and
        that
        your metabolism wakes up and begins working hard. After a long
        night of
        sleeping, your carbohydrate level should be at a low point. This
        is
        prime-time for your body to tap into those fat stores and start
        burning
        off those excess pounds. If you were to eat carbohydrate at this
        time,
        this entire process would go out the window. You see,
        carbohydrate is
        the body's preferred fuel source. Given this fact, your body
        will
        choose to use carbohydrate for energy whenever it is available.
        So how
        do we ensure we burn fat early in the day? We skip the carbs (or
        keep
        them very low) at our first meal. This allows the metabolism to
        tear
        into those fat stores and puts you on the way toward serious fat
        burn
        and weight loss.</p>
      <p>Of course carbohydrates are an extremely important source of
        energy so they absolutely need to be part of your diet. Be sure
        to work
        quality carbohydrate sources into your diet around mid-day and
        at every
        meal thereafter until later in the afternoon. Once you start to
        wind-down for the evening (usually 6:00PM or so), it is
        important to
        once again reduce carbohydrate intake so that your body does not
        have
        any excess carbohydrate calories to convert into fat. Excess
        carbohydrates are converted into fat and stored by the body so
        it's
        important to never be in a situation where excess exists. While
        eating
        carbohydrate in the middle of your day be sure to use the best
        sources
        to maximize their effect on your body. Some of the best
        carbohydrate
        sources are beans (all kinds), lentils, sweet potatoes and
        oatmeal.
        Ensure that these foods have plenty of presence in your diet
        during the
        mid-day hours, but make their presence scarce in the morning and
        late
        evening for best fat burning results.</p>
      <p><b>3. Do low-intensity aerobic training on an empty
          stomach when you wake</b></p>
      <p>This method is the perfect complement to #2 above. Together
        they perform a complete coup on body fat and excess weight. It's
        not
        important to get up and train hard, in fact I don't recommend
        that for
        optimal weight loss. My recommendation is to wake up and do
        about
        thirty minutes of moderate intensity aerobic training. Of course
        this
        should be done just prior to eating your first meal which will
        consist
        primarily of protein and very little or no carbohydrate.</p>
      <p>By doing aerobic training on an empty stomach you are tapping
        right into your fat stores and burning them away with every
        passing
        minute. Since you have optimally reduced carbohydrate intake
        early the
        night before, your body should have very little carbohydrate
        (the
        preferred fuel source) to burn through in order to maximize your
        fat
        burn. I have my clients do something basic like walk on the
        treadmill,
        ride their bike or swim laps in a pool. The key is to keep your
        intensity moderate and keep moving for the entire aerobic
        training
        session. If you did #2 above properly the night before, your
        body will
        be a fat burning furnace and will literally melt body fat away
        not only
        as you exercise, but afterward. Because the meal that follows
        your "on
        empty" aerobic training session is high in protein and low in
        carbohydrate, your body will continue to burn fat for fuel well
        into
        the mid-day until you introduce quality carbohydrates into your
        diet
        during the middle of your day.</p>
      <p><b>4. Lift heavy things often</b></p>
      <p>The human body was designed to lift heavy things. Our muscles
        need to be stressed in order to burn ample calories and increase
        metabolism. If you are performing strategy #1 above properly,
        your body
        is in perfect position to benefit maximally from regular
        sessions of
        heavy lifting. Weight training as seen in most gyms is the most
        common
        form resistance training for sure, but any form of weight
        training that
        places considerable stress on your skeletal muscles will cause
        your
        body to react with increases in metabolism and therefore calorie
        usage.</p>
      <p>One aspect of heavy lifting that is often overlooked is the
        fact that it works to promote healthy hormone balance in both
        men and
        women. Sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen play
        important roles
        in fat burning, storage and metabolism as a whole so healthy
        hormone
        levels are important for long-term weight loss. Lifting heavy
        weights
        is not something you have to do every day but I recommend my
        clients do
        at least three days of lifting each week preferably five for
        twenty to
        forty-five minutes.</p>
      <p><b>5. Protect your Liver</b></p>
      <p>Your liver is responsible for a lot of things, but one thing
        in particular is important to the issue we are now discussing.
        Your
        liver produces bile primarily from the breakdown of red blood
        cells.
        Your liver stores bile in the gall bladder. Bile is essential to
        breakdown fats that we ingest. This is important! When you eat
        fat,
        your gall bladder secretes bile so that those fats can be
        emulsified
        (broken down) into little bitty droplets. It is paramount that
        your
        liver function properly if your desire is to burn fat and avoid
        excess
        fat storage. It would not be a stretch of the imagination to
        consider
        that a huge percentage of obese people have fatty unhealthy
        livers.
        Liver health is essential to steady, healthful and long-term
        weight
        loss.</p>
      <p><i>Here are some things you can do to ensure liver
          health:</i>
        <br>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>avoid excess alcohol</li>
        <li>avoid drugs of all kinds whenever possible (unless your
          physician prescribes them)</li>
        <li>avoid all types of steroids if possible</li>
        <li>avoid high fat, high sugar foods</li>
        <li>eat high quality fruits and vegetables</li>
        <li>eat organic foods when possible</li>
        <li>ensure adequate fiber in your diet</li>
        <li>drink a lot of water throughout the day</li>
      </ol>
    </big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><b>6.
          Support fat burning enzyme activity</b></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>This
        is a relatively new area of research in the
        scientific realm. However, we do know a couple of things
        absolutely
        increase your body's level of fat-burning enzymes. Luckily, if
        you are
        taking care of #3 and #4 above you're off to a great start.
        Regular
        aerobic training and lean muscle growth are recognized as the
        primary
        means by which your body increases its fat-burning enzyme
        levels.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>A
        second school of thought is that you can burn fat
        and lose unwanted pounds by taking advantage of the enzymes
        found in
        various foods. This is easy if you are eating quality foods as
        recommended in #1 above. Foods like avocado, walnuts, almonds
        and olive
        oil are just a few quality foods containing high levels of
        lipase, an
        enzyme that is responsible for breaking down fat. Scientists
        have found
        that low lipase levels have a direct relationship to high blood
        lipid
        levels which are associated with coronary heart disease,
        something
        common among obese populations.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>No
        matter how you look at it, having quality foods
        and regular exercise as an integral part of your lifestyle will
        absolutely help you melt body fat and lose weight. The six
        strategies
        listed above are extremely effective at reducing body fat levels
        quickly and safely.</big></p>
