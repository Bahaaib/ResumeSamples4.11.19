      <p>So you are one of those people that are <strong>looking
          for a quick weight loss miracle</strong>? You are reading this
        article, because you think that I am going to bestow on you a
        miracle
        weight loss treatment and you will be saved from your
        "obesitized" or
        overweight life.</p>
      <p>Well my dear friend, there is no such this as a miracle weight
        loss drug, but I AM going to point you in the direction of
        something
        that will speed up your weight loss like none other.</p>
      <p><strong>Being overweight is fine for <u>some</u>
          people</strong>, but it's an horrible feeling when you are
        self-conscious. The worst thing ever is to suddenly gain a
        considerable
        amount of weight and people telling you that you have. Just the
        thought
        that others around you constantly think about how fat you became
        makes
        one feel extremely self- conscious. You start to feel very
        ashamed and
        in most cases of weight gain, depressed.</p>
      <p>Now, I know you don't want to be overweight. I am not even
        going into all the negative effects that being overweight has on
        your
        life and body. You know that it's very bad and it's all you need
        to
        know. In some cases it can lead to death o.k!</p>
      <p><strong>So what should you do to lose weight?</strong></p>
      <p>I am going to tell you a secret that nobody else is probably
        going to tell you about weight loss. All you have to do is
        follow this
        article and apply what you learn here and I promise you you will
        lose
        weight. You have to follow what I teach you here exactly. If you
        do,
        you will reap the benefits.</p>
      <p><strong>The secret?</strong></p>
      <p>Here it is...<strong>It's all in your diet.</strong>
        This is the number one thing you should conquer and I promise
        you that
        you will lose weight. In a moment I will explain to you very
        simply
        what principles you should follow to lose weight quick.</p>
      <p>Do not go out and buy a stupid book or ebook, because all of
        them shove you into training and some of them include very bad
        diet
        information. I would prefer it if you go out and do
        cardiovascular
        training, due to it's ability to help you lose weight very fast.
        I will
        explain what you need to do in the gym or outdoors to achieve
        this as
        well. Don't worry, everything is very easy. The best thing is,
        is that
        THIS diet is not really a diet. You will eat like a king!!</p>
      <p>O.k, so here we go.</p>
      <p><strong>First up is your diet.</strong></p>
      <p>The most important thing to a diet is the WAY you diet. You
        can eat as much celery as you want,but you won't lose weight.
        You might
        lose some weight,but be sure that you will pick up double that
        weight.
        Another thing is a balance between proteins, carbohydrates and
        fat.
        Don't worry about counting calories. Very few people do except
        proffesional fitness people. Don't worry, I have structured a
        meal plan
        for you that contains the right balance or proteins,
        carbohydrates and
        fat.</p>
      <p>Y<strong>ou need to structure you diet into 5 meals a day</strong>
        (if you are a women) <strong>or 6 meals</strong> (if you
        are a man).</p>
      <p>This is probably freaking you out now, but please listen and I
        will explain. If you try to diet by eating nothing, you will
        gain
        weight the moment food enters your mouth afterwards.</p>
      <p>Your body is like a fireplace-oven. It needs to be kept heated
        the whole time. Feeding the fireplace at the appropriate times
        will
        make it function perfectly. The same thing goes for your body.
        You need
        to space out meals throughout the day to keep your body in a
        metabolic
        state. Remember, your body WANTS to be fed constantly, but you
        have to
        give it just the right food. If you don't eat anything for quite
        a
        while and suddenly you eat a lot, your body will think it's not
        going
        to get food the nex time so it will produce fat from the meal
        you ate.
        It's a survival mechanism. Spacing 5-6 small meals throughout
        your day
        is the optimal way to keep your body's metabolic state constant.
        This
        way your body will start to burn fat like butter on a flaming
        hot pan.</p>
      <p>When I am talking about 5 or 6 meals a day, I am talking about
        <strong>portions the size of both of your hands cupped together</strong>
        (like you're begging).2 to 3 hours apart between each meals are
        optimal.</p>
      <p>I am going to provide you with the most powerful fat burning <strong>"good
          foods"</strong> known to mankind. Please don't try to eat just
        one of these. You won't lose weight. You need to combine them. I
        will
        explain it later using a predetermined meal plan. Here are the
        ingredients:</p>
      <p>*Almonds and other types of nuts</p>
      <p>*Beans and legumes</p>
      <p>*Eggs</p>
      <p>*Extra protein powder</p>
      <p>*Fat-free or low-fat milk,yogurt &amp; cheese</p>
      <p>*Instant Oatmeal that is unsweetened and unflavoured</p>
      <p>*Olive oil</p>
      <p>*Peanut butter</p>
      <p>*Rasberries and other berries</p>
      <p>*Turkey and other lean meats</p>
      <p>*Whole grain or whole wheat breads and cereals.</p>
      <p><strong>Please avoid the following foods at all costs:</strong></p>
      <p>*Margarine</p>
      <p>*Fried foods especially fast food.</p>
      <p>*Commercially manufactured baked goods</p>
      <p>*Any food with partially hydrogenated oil on it's list of
        ingredients.</p>
      <p>*Fatty cuts of red meat</p>
      <p>*Whole-milk dairy products</p>
      <p>*Softdrinks</p>
      <p>*Alcohol - limit your alcohol to a maximum of 2 drinks (beer
        or red wine) a week.</p>
      <p>Later we are going to explain to you how to combine the "good
        food" ingredients to get a incredible quick weight loss fat
        burning
        diet.</p>
      <p>Now we get to what exercises you should be doing. <strong>This
          exercise takes round about 20 minutes</strong>.</p>
      <p>This article covers only cardiovascular exercises.</p>
      <p>Please remember that muscle burns fat. No other body mechanism
        burns fat better. I am not saying you should look like a
        bodybuilder or
        look muscular, but adding only a little muscle all over your
        body will
        dramatically increase your fat burning efforts. Even
        cardiovascular
        exercises adds muscle to your body, but not as much or fast as
        weight
        training.</p>
      <p>This doesn't matter that much, because cardiovascular
        exercises does increase muscle mass to some extent, especially
        in your
        legs, but it doesn't make you look too muscular. Just nice and
        toned.</p>
      <p>Here is a <strong>cardiovascular Interval exercise</strong>
        that you need to perform at least once a week, and a maximum of
        3 times
        a week. Do not do them one right after the other. Leave a day or
        to
        between. You can do it on a stationary bicycle or treadmill or
        even
        outdoor running or cycling. Write it down and use a watch to
        time
        yourself. <strong>This exercise is fun and quick</strong>.
        Just do it.</p>
      <p>4-6 Minutes warmup (To get your heart rate up)</p>
      <p>30 Seconds High Intensity (Sharply Increase your speed and/or
        your resistance)</p>
      <p>1 Minute Low Intensity (Decrease speed and/or resistance and
        keep it constant for the 1 minute)</p>
      <p>45 Seconds High Intensity</p>
      <p>1 Minute Low intensity</p>
      <p>1 Minute High Intensity</p>
      <p>1 Minute Low Intensity</p>
      <p>90 Seconds High Intensity</p>
      <p>1 1/2 Minutes Low Intensity</p>
      <p>1 Minute High Intensity</p>
      <p>60 Seconds Low Intensity</p>
      <p>45 Seconds High Intensity</p>
      <p>1 Minute Low Intensity</p>
      <p>30 Seconds High Intensity</p>
      <p>3-5 Minutes Cool off (Walking it off)</p>
      <p>...go home.</p>
      <p>You can change this outlay, but it's not recommended that you
        decrease the time spent, nor should you increase it too much in
        your
        beginning stages. You can add to it later, but remember to keep
        your
        higher intensities shorter than your low intensities with the
        higher
        intensities increasing during the workout and finally decrease.</p>
      <p><strong>O.k. Let's get to how to combine those "good
          foods" up there into an effective diet to lose weight very
          quick.</strong></p>
      <p>I am going to provide you with a 2 day sample diet routine.
        You can eat the same one every day, but a little change now and
        then
        would help you stay focused with you diet and excercise.</p>

          tamatoes or any other vegetable.</em></p>

      <p><strong>Lunch:</strong> <em>Add the
          following foods to make a sandwich - 2 slices whole wheat
          bread.</em>
        2 ounces(56 grams) sliced roast beef, 2 leaves lettuce(washed
        obviously), teaspoon of low fat mayonnaise and 1 ounce(28 grams)
        of
        fat-free cheese.</p>
      <p><strong>Snack:</strong> 1 ounce(28grams) Raisins
        and 1 ounce Almonds. Please note!!! NO SALTED NUTS!</p>
      <p><strong>Dinner:</strong> 4-5 Ounces(113-142grams)
        Tendered Chicken Breasts; 2,25 ounces(63grams) cooked "whole
        wheat"
        spaghetti with a cup of spaghetti sauce; 1/2 teaspoon flour; 1
        tablespoons water; 1 teaspoon olive oil; 1 tablespoon chilly
        powder;
        1/8 onion finely chopped. <em>Heat the oil in a nonstick pan.
          Add chopped onion and cook it for about 1 minute until it's
          brownish.
          Mix the flour and water in a small bowl (The amount of water
          and flour
          can be adjusted. The examples above was scaled down to provide
          one
          serving.) Additional water and flour may be required to make
          the
          flour-water mixture just right.) Add your chicken, the chilli
          powder,sauce and the flour mixture all to the pan. Stir it.
          Let it
          simmer uncovered for about 10 minutes. Serve it over your
          cooked
          spaghetti (you should cook the spaghetti seperately).</em></p>
      <p><strong>Snack:</strong> Smoothie - 1 banana, 1/2
        cup 1% milk, 1/2 cup low-fat vanilla yogurt, 1/8 cup frozen
        orange
        juice concentrate,2 teaspoons whey powder, 8 crushed Ice Cubes.</p>
      <p><strong>There is one thing about this quick weight loss
          diet that is really cool. <em>You are allowed to cheat on one
            of
            your meals only ONCE a week. Preferably at lunch OR dinner.</em>
          Lets say you ate correctly the whole week, Saturday comes and
          you feel
          like you want to order a pizza and drink a beer. Go ahead,
          order that
          pizza and drink that beer (limited to 2). Now remember to
          start your
          diet the next day and continue for the week until the next
          cheat meal.</strong></p>
      <p>Do you know why you can cheat on a meal? This is precisely the
        opposite thing your body does in respect of the previous
        situation
        where you if you eat too less and suddenly ate a lot, your body
        will
        gain/store fat due to the surviving mechanism. If your body is
        at a
        constant metabolic rate during the weak and you suddenly eat a
        cheat
        meal, your body will want to reject the unhealthy fat. In the
        same
        process your body will burn even more fat and lose weight
        quicker,
        because it needs to stabilize it's metabolic rate which was
        increased
        because of the cheat meal.</p>
      <p><u><strong>QUICK WEIGHT LOSS MEAL PLAN - SAMPLE
            DAY 2</strong></u></p>
