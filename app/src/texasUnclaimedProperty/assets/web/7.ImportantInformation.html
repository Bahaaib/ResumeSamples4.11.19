    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In 1999, the
          Montel Williams show aired a presentation about lost money. At
          first I thought that the subject of the show was money that
          someone previously had literally lost. The subject could have
          been funds squandered either through gambling or bad
          investments. Though, the show was about funds that many of us
          have and we simply don’t know that we have it.<br>
          <br>
          Chat show host Oprah Winfrey also had an interesting show on
          the topic of lost money. Oprah proved that people are not
          conscious of the missing funds by uniting seventy-thousand
          dollars in lost money to audience members. These audience
          members were pleasantly surprised to have the funds that were
          rightfully theirs. Further she went on to explain that
          hundreds of millions of dollars go unclaimed each year.<br>
          <br>
          A great number of Americans have unclaimed property, or lost
          money, floating around in federal and state accounts. The
          unclaimed money or property alone has reached in excess of
          forty billion dollars in these institutions. Here’s the
          interesting part. Nearly over five-hundred billion dollars are
          held up in both private and public corporations. These
          staggering numbers are due to the simple fact that people are
          not even aware about their lost money.<br>
          <br>
          A rough estimate of seven out of ten people has unclaimed
          property or funds locked away somewhere without even knowing
          about it. Of all odds, you might be just one of those people.
          The question is whether Montel Williams or Oprah Winfrey will
          have repeat shows on the topic of lost money but it doesn’t
          seem likely. Unfortunately Oprah Winfrey and Montel Williams
          don’t have quite enough time to find lost money for people
          across the United States. Of course, it may be in your best
          interest to take matters into your own hands by doing a little
          research for your self. Your first step would be finding out
          about your heritage could. Additionally there are also several
          web sites that offer information on the subject of finding
          lost money as well.<br>
          <br>
          As always, it is best to be wary of scams when it comes to
          personal finances and personal information. One must always
          avoid divulging too much information to an unsecured party. In
          case someone asks for your date of birth, your social security
          number and your mother’s maiden name, a red flag should go up.
          Furthermore, you never want to provide information about your
          personal bank account and you definitely don’t want to make an
          investment on your search. If the money is yours, you should
          be able to find it without doling out a lot of cash in the
          process.<br>

          Where do the billion and billions of unclaimed dollars all
          come from &gt; Each and every year hundreds of thousands of
          individuals across the United States and Canada , leave their
          friends , family relatives and birthplace to follow a dream m
          start another life and to consequently relocate.<br>
          <br>
          The reasons they leave “home” are as varied as there are
          people who do! But one thing is certain; those who move away
          are looking towards the future. Not to the past. In turn many
          thousands lose contact either by chance or by choice with the
          passing of time.<br>
          <br>
          Our forever changing society has resulted in the fact that
          most people do not have the slightest idea who, where most of
          their relatives are! Think of it! Do you personally know all
          of your relatives? That includes aunts, great- aunts, uncles
          and great-uncles, half- brothers and sisters, grandparents,
          great-grandparents etc etc. The answer for most people is an
          unequivocal now.<br>
          <br>
          Grandparents generally have some sketchy ideas about the
          long-range past, but if one asks for information regarding
          missing or l “long lost relatives” it never comes up. And once
          the grandparents are gone chances are that you will never
          know.<br>
          <br>
          So why is all this important? Because “lost” works both ways.
          Either you have long lost relatives or you yourself are a lost
          relative if someone who would like to get in touch with you.
          It could well mean – “untold” wealth that is just waiting to
          be discovered.<br>
          <br>
          Imagine for a moment that a great-uncle, who has survived and
          aunt dies and has named you as the sole heir to his entire
          estate of 2 million dollars. However no one, including the
          great- uncle knew where you were. After a half-hearted search,
          the attorneys will take their fees from the estate and the
          balance will go to the states: unclaimed money account”. Or if
          you reside in Canada to the “Bank of Canada”.<br>
          <br>
          It has been estimated that over $ 250,000,000,000 in unclaimed
          money is being held by the U.S.’s individual states and upward
          of $ 500,000,000 by the Banks of Canada.<br>
          <br>
          In Canada, all financial institutions are required by law to
          submit the names and last known address of accounts that have
          been inactive for at least seven years. After that period of
          time, the financial institution has already sent out two
          notices. One is sent out after two years of inactivity, the
          next after five years. After the limit is reached all
          unclaimed funds are released to the Bank of Canada, but each
          account, as in the case of U.S. accounts remains in the name
          of the original holder.<br>
          <br>
          In the United States, each state has a different standard of
          time variance, although many may be the same. However, all
          financial institutions including retirement funds, insurance
          companies, banks, county government offices etc are also
          required by law to report unclaimed money to the state. After
          a period of time as specified by law, the money is then turned
          over to the state treasury department unclaimed property
          division. In either case, to get their rightful money, all you
          need to do is locate it, and then ask for it.<br>
