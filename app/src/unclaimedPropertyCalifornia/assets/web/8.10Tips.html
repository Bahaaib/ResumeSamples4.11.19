          Unclaimed Money or Property encompasses any financial
          obligation that is due and owed to another party (customer,
          vendor, employee, contributor, etc.). The key rule to remember
          is that this property never becomes the organization's
          property - it always belongs to the person or entity owed.
          Unfortunately, many organizations do not realize that un
          cashed checks, escrow balances, customer deposits, mysterious
          credits, and unclaimed payroll and insurance benefits qualify
          as unclaimed property. These organizations are often referred
          to as the Holder of the abandoned money or property.<br>
          <br>
          1. Once the abandoned money or property is remitted to
          [escheated] to the State in which the Owner was last known to
          have resided the "dormancy period" for that type of abandoned
          property has expired. The typical dormancy periods in most
          States of three to five years that means that an organization
          can only keep these items on their books and retain the
          associated funds for this period of time and then it must
          escheat / remit the funds to the appropriate State. Once the
          abandoned money reaches the State, the money or property is
          called referred to as unclaimed money or property.<br>
          <br>
          2. An issue can be that can have his abandoned money or
          property escheated to a State in which the Owner has never
          lived. If the Holder of the abandoned money or property is
          headquarters in a different State, the abandoned money will be
          escheated / remitted to that State. For example many large
          publicly traded Companies with office or branches throughout
          the country are headquartered in a State such as Delaware.<br>
          <br>
          3. Unfortunately, the laws governing the unclaimed money are
          both complex and vary from State to State. Complex for both
          the Owner of the unclaimed money and the Holder of the
          abandoned money. The challenge with regard to unclaimed
          property laws is that they are complex. Each state has its own
          set of laws. Even if you only have property to report to one
          state, many states require the filing of "negative" reports,
          meaning it is your obligation as an organization to tell them
          you have nothing to report. But you very likely have liability
          to more than one state, each with its own dormancy periods and
          rules on how to report each of the more than 100 different
          property types that can become classified as unclaimed
          property.<br>
          <br>
          4. The format of the State's unclaimed money database also
          varies widely:<br>
          <br>
          • The fields of information or data points are varies and not
          consistent; many States by law cannot display the actual
          dollar amount<br>
          <br>
          • If a dollar amount is displayed and the amount is "$0.00" or
          "unknown", that does NOT mean that there is no unclaimed money
          but rather the unclaimed property cannot valued. Examples
          would be if the unclaimed property is stock(s) or a Bond whose
          value can change daily. IF the State has not yet sold the
          stock(s) or Bond. Another example would be jewelry or precious
          coins found in an abandoned Bank Safety Deposit Box. Its value
          is moot and cannot be accurately valued.<br>
          <br>
          5. One needs to be savvy while searching for possible
          unclaimed money or property;<br>
          <br>
          • Check any State in which one has resided<br>
          <br>
          • Women should check both maiden, married and divorced last
          names<br>
          <br>
          • Never use a single apostrophe. i.e.) if last name is
          O'Brian, the last name search would be O'Brian.<br>
          <br>
          • A search for a Business unclaimed money must be the
          Company's exact name:<br>
          <br>
          • The Auto Glass Co. not Auto Glass Company<br>
          <br>
          • A &amp; B Company not A and B Company<br>
          <br>
          • Check the common varies spellings of specific last names as:<br>
          <br>
          • Thompson, Thomson <br>
          <br>
          • Smith, Smyth <br>
          <br>
          • Robertson, Robinson <br>
          <br>
          • Schmidt, Schmid, Schmit, Schmitt <br>
          <br>
          • Barry, Berry <br>
          <br>
          • O'Brian, O'Brien<br>
          <br>
          6. Some States do not list the unclaimed money in their public
          database until 2 years after the lost property has been
          escheated to them. Most States' Unclaimed Property Divisions
          are understaffed so updating their databases can be belated.
          So keep checking regularly and frequently.<br>
          <br>
          7. States are meant to be the Custodians of the unclaimed
          property that means that they honor the Owner's or Claimant's
          or his heirs to claim the unclaimed asset for perpetuity.
          However, a few States have quietly passed laws by which if the
          unclaimed property is not claimed in 10 years, the property is
          reverted to the State as its property. Indiana is one of these
          States.<br>
          <br>
          8. Although non-compliance was largely ignored in past years,
          the growth of state budget deficits led by the current
          economic downturn has brought the issue to the front
          burner.While most states have departments committed to
          returning unclaimed property to the actual owner, less than 30
          percent on average is ever returned, (therefore 70%+ remain
          current/active) which allows cash-strapped states to use the
          money they collect as unclaimed property to fund various
          public interest projects. The remainder is placed in a small
          reserve fund from which owner claims are paid. Therefore,
          unclaimed property represents, in essence, a "quiet" source of
          revenue that does not require the government to raise taxes.
          As a result, state enforcement efforts have steadily grown and
          audits to drive compliance are at an all-time high. <br>
          <br>
          9. Real estate, cars, boats, fixtures and even animals that
          may be abandoned but are not generally applicable to the
          unclaimed property statutes and are neither transferred to nor
          held in State's Unclaimed Property Division. The only tangible
          property that is transferred to the States are the contents of
          a financial institution's safe deposit box when the safe
          deposit box has been abandoned.<br>
          <br>
          10. States aren't the only ones holding onto unclaimed
          property. Many Federal Government unclaimed money or property
          are:<br>
          <br>
          • Federal Income Tax refunds<br>
          <br>
          • FHA Mortgage Insurance premium refunds<br>
          <br>
          • FDIC for failed Banks<br>
          <br>
          • Unclaimed Pensions<br>
          <br>
          • Lost Treasury Bonds<br>
          <br>
          • American Indian Trust Royalties<br>
          <br>
          • War Claims for US Nationals<br>
