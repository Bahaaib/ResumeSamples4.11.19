          This app has been carefully put together to bring you some of
          the best information about the Dash Diet.&nbsp; It starts off
          by telling you all about the diet and then the app goes on to
          give you some general healthy eating information.&nbsp; There
          is also a free book at the end of the app that gives you some
          healthy juice recipes to get you having more fruit in your
          diet.<br>
          <br>
          There are also some useful calculators and trackers that you
          will find as you go through the app.<br>
          <br>
          Please note that due to technical constraints you will find
          one or two blank pages in the initial documents.&nbsp; Just
          scroll on to the next page to keep reading.<br>
          <br>
          Enjoy the app and good luck with your healthy lifestyle!<br>
