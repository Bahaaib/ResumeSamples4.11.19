<body><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Stay Healthy With Exercise And These Helpful Nutrition Tips</b></div><div><br></div><div>If you have been feeling tired and don't seem to have the energy that you need to carry you through your busy day, it may be time to take an honest look at what you eat. Good nutrition is essential to having the energy you need and the sound advice in the article below may be just what you need to get started.</div><div><br></div><div>Eat foods that are high in Vitamin A and C. Vitamin A and C are very important for nutrition, functioning in the body as antioxidants. Antioxidants neutralize the free radicals that cause cell damage and increase the chance of serious disease. Vitamin A is mainly available in animal products and dark green or orange vegetables. Vitamin C is available in most fruits and vegetables, the primary sources including citrus fruits, strawberries, broccoli and tomatoes.</div><div><br></div><div>Aim to eat a lot of baked foods rather than fried. Baked foods are generally better for your body and come with a much lower count of calories, oils and carbohydrates. Also, you will feel a lot more energetic during the day if you consume quality baked foods on a daily basis.</div><div><br></div><div>Buying from a small farm near where you live has nutritional benefits. It can also have other benefits that are less calculable. If you go to the farm and talk with the farmer and see how the food is grown, you will gain a personal connection and satisfaction with your food.</div><div><br></div><div>When you are eating, it helps if you actually eat your food slower. When you savor your food, it is more likely that you will feel full much quicker, than if you just wolf it all down at once. You can even try eating half of your meal and then pausing for a few minutes and then finishing the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>Keeping a food journal can help you meet your nutrition goals. Online food diaries can track the foods you eat, creating a record of your intake as well as showing the nutritional value of those foods. By keeping a record over time, you can tweak your diet as needed so that you get better nutrition.</div><div><br></div><div>Eat a diet of mostly plant-based foods, with a little animal protein and healthy monounsaturated oils. This type of diet will provide your body with the nutrients, protein, and essential fatty acids that you need to be healthy. A healthy variety of plant-based foods also gives your body the fiber it needs for good health and to maintain regularity.</div><div><br></div><div>Choose your dairy products carefully. While dairy products provide many nutrients including calcium, potassium, vitamin D and protein, you should choose low-fat or fat-free products. Drink skim or low-fat milk, as this cuts the calories, but doesn't reduce the nutrients. If you are lactose intolerant, you can try lactose-free milk or soy milk. Many cheeses are high in saturated fat, so opt for a reduced-fat version.</div><div><br></div><div>Making good nutritional choices will make an amazing difference in your energy level, and it will help you get the most out of every busy day. The practical recommendations in the article above offers sound advice to help you make the right choices to feed your body with the most nutritious food.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
