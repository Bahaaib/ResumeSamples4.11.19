Are you unsure how you can lose weight, and intimidated at the thought of beginning? Don't worry- everyone has to start somewhere, and this article is here to give you the best chance by outlining tips to get your body in shape.</div><div><br></div><div>To stay on track with your weight loss program, weigh yourself every day. Not only does this make it impossible for you to deny when you stay off course, but it also clearly shows even the smallest of progress. Just make sure your scale is properly calibrated and weigh at the same time every day to avoid natural fluctuations.</div><div><br></div><div>Help yourself lose weight at work by making changes to work habits that don't help your goal. Instead of gossiping in the breakroom, walk around the block or up and down the stairwell. Stay away from the vending machine by bringing healthier snacks to work. Nosh on almonds, walnuts, low fat granola bars, or celery sticks with peanut butter to help keep hunger cravings away.</div><div><br></div><div>You do not have to go on a fad diet to lose weight all you have to do is eat smaller portions. Many people do not realize that if they just cut back on their portion sizes that they are eating they will be able to lose weight very quickly. This also helps to not feel deprived from foods that you love.</div><div><br></div><div>Drink the recommended amount of water every day. Usually, this is eight glasses of water but when you are active you will want to increase the amount you drink so you will stay hydrated. Drinking water will also keep you from getting hungry as often and prevent you from eating as much.</div><div><br></div><div>To enhance your weight loss efforts, you should try keeping a diary. By maintaining a journal, you can pinpoint triggers for emotional eating and overeating. To keep a weight loss diary, simply record what you eat and what you are thinking or feeling at the time, for example, whether you are feeling stressed or tired.</div><div><br></div><div>Remember as a dieter that most diets out there will only maintain your weight after a certain amount of time. So if you want to keep on losing the weight, you will have to continue to push yourself harder and harder. Once you lose the desired amount of weight, then you can coast through on maintenance mode.</div><div><br></div><div>Don't traumatize yourself by eliminating foods that you enjoy, just decrease portions and frequency. If you eliminate those foods that you love most from your diet completely, you will discourage yourself and find that it is more difficult to lose weight. However, if you simply reduce your intake and the frequency of that intake, you can still enjoy these foods without feeling too guilty.</div><div><br></div><div>Now that you have the secrets of weight loss at your disposal, you're ready to begin a program to shed some pounds and start feeling and looking great! Wait until you can fit into your old clothes again! Start applying the tips you've read now and start working toward a fitter, healthier body!</div><div><br></div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><b>Dieting Tips For Weight Loss</b></div><div><br></div><div>Keep A Diary Of What You Eat</div><div><br></div><div>I think you will be very surprised if before you start your diet you keep a journal of what you eat and at what times. Do this for about a week. Then study your journal and see where you can cut back and find out at what times are you eating that could cause problems. If you find you are having a snack at 10 pm at night. Try bringing the time time in. You never what to eat to soon before you go to bed.</div><div><br></div><div>Buy Diet Food Prepared</div><div><br></div><div>What can make dieting hard to stick to is the preparation? Having the diet food available to you also means having to go shopping then come home and prepare your healthy meal. Now a days it seems everyone is so rushed with no time to spare. Would it not be easier to have your diet meal already prepared for you? There are a few diet nutrition food programs that will actually ship the food right to your door. Talk about convenience. I know of a few diets that deliver food, Atkins At Home, Diet To Your Door, Diet To Go, eDiets - Fresh Cuisine, Jenny Direct, Nutrisystem, Sunfare and Zone Chefs.</div><div><br></div><div>Smaller Plates To Help Lose Weight</div><div><br></div><div>Use smaller plates to help you lose weight. This will give you smaller portions but may fool the eyes. Never feel you have to finish everything on your plate. This does not mean you have to throw food out. You can store diet food for later. If you feel full, stop.</div><div><br></div><div>Snacks Ready To Eat</div><div><br></div><div>Have healthy snacks ready to eat. Instead of grabbing for the chips have carrot slices ready to grab. You will still get that sensation of crunchy with a more healthy nutritious choice.</div><div><br></div><div>Water, Water, Water</div><div><br></div><div>If you do some research regarding dieting one thing you will hear over and over is to drink plenty of water. Not only will water help to fill you up so you do not eat to much, but it is also great for your appearance. Water is the best beauty treatment. It flushes out the impurities and gives you great looking skin.</div><div><br></div><div>Drinking water can also improve muscle tone. Muscles having all the water they need contract easier. Drinking water can give you a more effective workout when you exercise.</div><div><br></div><div>You should drink at least 8 8 oz glasses of water a day and more if you are more than 25 pounds over weight. For every 25 lbs I would drink another 8 oz glass of water.</div><div><br></div><div>Keep water by you. Use a straw if that will help you drink more.</div><div><br></div><div>Good luck and stick with it. Take it day by day. I also recommend only weighing your self once a week. As always before you start any diet or exercise program check with your doctor first.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
