    <p><big>It is common that lot of people want to lose fat fast.
        Today's
        society likes things to happen fast and weight loss is no
        different. It
        goes a long way to understanding why we have fallen into the
        fast food
        trap and put on some extra weight which we now need to lose. <br>
        <br>
        The bad part is that while weight goes on fast, it comes off
        slowly.
        But if you know some inside secrets there ways to get your body
        to lose
        fat quickly and you can lose 15 pounds fast if you need to. <br>
        <br>
        When you want to lose 15 pounds fast you need to make sure that
        is your
        single most important goal. You need to take drastic action to
        lose 15
        pounds. Losing 15 pounds fast requires that you stick to a diet
        and
        exercise plan. Stick to the program and losing 15 pounds fast is
        definitely within reach. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The Right Foods to Eat</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Let me be very clear about one point. To lose 15 pounds fast you
        need
        to implement a diet plan that in one way or another cuts some of
        calories, including cutting back on your favorite fast foods and
        drinks. <br>
        <br>
        Cutting back on these things isnt easy so you need to make sure
        that
        over the time you are dieting you are 100% committed to losing
        those 15
        pounds otherwise it just wont work for you. To lose weight fast
        and
        meet the goals you have set, you dont need to starve yourself of
        food
        and spend each day feeling famished, deprived and tired. There
        are many
        foods that will give your body energy to keep active and keep up
        your
        heart rate. <br>
        <br>
        If you want to lose 15 pounds fast here's a tip. <br>
        <br>
        Put fruits and vegetables on your plate instead of carbohydrates
        likes
        rice, bread and pasta. No Im not saying you should become a
        vegetarian
        but if you want to lose 15 pounds fast then this is a proven
        method.
        And just a reminder that you must eat protein with each meal
        that you
        eat. It's a little different between women and men, but as a
        guideline
        women should be aiming for 3 ounces of protein sources from lean
        skinless chicken, fish or lean meat and men aim for 4 to 5
        ounces of
        the same with every meal. <br>
        <br>
        But dont forget protein isnt only in meats. Protein can also be
        found
        in foods such as cottage cheese. <br>
        <br>
        Trying to lose 15 pounds fast means that you have to stick to
        the
        program. Unlike trying to lose weight in a more natural way you
        can't
        take any shortcuts. Put simply if you want to lose 15 pounds
        fast you
        have to make sure you follow your plan down to every letter. <br>
        <br>
        So that means you should be cutting out all alcohol, sodas,
        foods high
        in sugar and fats, fast food, and cut back on breads, pastas and
        rice.
        The best thing that comes out of cutting back on these things is
        that
        some people end up changing their diets permanently and they
        never go
        back to those high fat and high sugar foods, meaning they are
        healthier
        and can manage their weight better. <br>
        <br>
        Heres a tip on sugary treats. <br>
        <br>
        Leave them completely out of your diet and don't tempt yourself
        by
        buying a treat for your 'partner' or child and then end up
        eating it
        yourself. Sugary foods can destroy your weight loss regime even
        in
        small quantities. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You HAVE to Exercise <br>
        </strong><br>
        Okay I now exercise isnt popular but if you want to lose 15
        pounds
        fast you need to move. A good exercise routine should involve
        you
        getting moving 3 to 4 times a week. <br>
        And because you are aiming for a high weight loss in a short
        time span,
        the exercise that you do is very important. Cross training your
        whole
        body works the best, the yoga can wait for another time!. <br>
        <br>
        A lot of people are worried when they here the words
        cross-training but
        don't let it get to you. People who do cross training find that
        it's
        the best way to lose fat quickly and is more effective than the
        usual
        gym routines. <br>
        <br>
        Here a quick tip. When your next at the gym don't do the usual
        and just
        set the treadmill at your usual running speed. Spend some time
        on the
        rowing machine or stationary bike as well. <br>
        <br>
        Give this a go. 10 minutes at your normal pace on the treadmill,
        25
        minutes on the stationary bike, and 15 minutes on the rowing
        machine.
        If you're really up the challenge try the stair climber which is
        a
        regular favourite on shows like the Biggest Loser and a proven
        fat loss
        exercise. <br>
        <br>
        Through some simple changes to your normal routine you make a
        big
        differennce in trying to lose 15 pounds fast. By putting your
        body
        through different routines it will get shocked into losing fat.
        <br>
        <br>
        A proven formula for losing 15 pounds quickly is a mix of cross
        training and a healthy diet.</big></p>
