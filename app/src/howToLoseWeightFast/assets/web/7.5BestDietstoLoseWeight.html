        <p>There are just too many diets and fad diets available today.
          I've found the 5 best diets to lose weight fast with that work
          for me.
          I have my own personal favourite which is a combination of
          three
          variations of the Scarsdale Diet with my absolute favourite
          being the
          economy version of the diet plan, but more on that in a bit.</p>
        <p>In my opinion the Scarsdale Diet Plans offer the most choices
          in the way of options that you can eat and the prices of the
          foodstuffs
          recommended can be tailored to your own personal circumstances
          and
          budget.</p>
        <p>From my own personal journeys into personal weight loss, it's
          important to choose a weight loss plan that you can stick to
          if you
          want to firstly lose some weight and more importantly have the
          ability
          to keep the weight off long term. In this article I outline
          the 5 best
          diets to lose weight fast that I've had personal success with
          and have
          recommended to others and seen in most cases they have had
          success with
          them too.</p>
        <p><strong>Important</strong>: Before considering any
          of the weight loss diets <u>always consult with your doctor
            or
            physician</u> before you embark on losing any appreciable
          weight
          as it could be unhealthy dependant on your physical condition.
          Seek
          your doctor's advice, that's what they are there for.</p>
        <p>These diets I have outlined below have helped me and various
          other to lose significant weight in a relatively short time
          compared to
          other diet plans I've attempted in the past. The very best of
          luck with
          the one you opt for!</p>

          consult with your doctor or physician prior to starting the
          Lemonade
          Diet.</p>
        <p>The instructions for the lemonade diet are as follows:</p>
        <p>1. Drink about 100 ounces of the lemonade per day.
          <br>
          2. Drink the salt water flush in the morning as soon as you
          wake up and
          drink the herbal laxative tea at night before bed.
          <br>
          3. You cannot eat anything while on the Lemonade Diet. You
          drink only
          the lemonade, the saltwater flush, and the herbal tea.
          <br>
          4. The Lemonade Diet is a detoxing and elimination diet, which
          claims
          to help rid the body of toxins along with helping you to lose
          weight
          fast.</p>
        <p><strong>Lemonade Recipe:</strong></p>
        <p>2 oz. of fresh squeezed lemon juice (must be fresh squeezed)
          2
          oz. of maple syrup (must be grade B, organic maple syrup) 1/4
          of a
          teaspoon of cayenne pepper 2 cups of water (spring water or
          purified
          water is best) Mix all ingredients well. This makes
          approximately 20
          ounces of lemonade, or two servings. You will need to drink
          about 10
          servings a day.</p>
        <p><strong>Salt Water Flush Recipe:</strong> 2
          teaspoons salt 1 litre of water Mix well. Allow at least half
          an hour
          after drinking before leaving the house. You'll need to be
          near a
          bathroom. During the lemonade diet, some dieters complain of
          diarrhea,
          dizziness, nausea or vomiting from the salt water flush.</p>
        <p><strong>See a doctor immediately if any of your symptoms
            are severe or prolonged or cause you discomfort. </strong></p>
