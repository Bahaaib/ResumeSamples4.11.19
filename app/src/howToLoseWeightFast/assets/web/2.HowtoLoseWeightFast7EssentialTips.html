        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Who wouldn't like to lose
          weight fast?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <br>
        Whether you want to shed some pounds for an upcoming high school
        reunion or just to look good for that upcoming summer beach
        vacation
        that you planned, you want quick weight loss results...now!<br>
        <br>
        However, losing too much weight too rapidly may not be healthy
        or good
        for your body. Granted, things like diet pills, fad diets or
        starvation
        diets may enable you to shed those pounds rapidly, but you have
        to know
        that these methods of weight loss can actually harm your heart
        (not
        good) and your other internal organs (even worse) as well.<br>
        <br>
        As such, try not to lose too much weight too quickly. Rather,
        follow
        these practical guidelines and you'll be able to lose weight
        safely,
        naturally and as fast as possible:<br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">1) Write Down Everything
          You Eat</span><br>
        <br>
        To lose weight, you have to expend more calories than you
        consume. To
        achieve this "calorie deficit", you either have to start
        consuming less
        calories or you'll have to start getting some exercise to burn
        more
        calories. Of course, it will be best if you can do both.<br>
        <br>
        Coming back to the point, writing down whatever you're eating
        makes it
        easier for you to track the total number of calories you're
        consuming a
        day, which in turn enables you to decide which foods you can eat
        less
        of or even avoid completely.<br>
        <br>
        Remember to include the little things like the amount of butter
        you're
        spreading on your morning toast, the spoonfuls of sugar in your
        coffee,
        the salad dressing on your salad...etc.<br>
        <br>
        You can do this by reading the food labels or looking up the
        many
        websites available nowadays which can easily show you the
        calorie
        counts of different foods.<br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Run Through Your List</span><br>
        <br>
        Have a glance at your list and see what foods can be eliminated
        or
        reduced.<br>
        <br>
        For example, if you drink a tall, full cream latte for breakfast
        every
        morning, you can consider switching to a hot cup of black coffee
        instead. Doing so may save you 500 calories every day, and over
        a week,
        that adds up to about 3,500 calories, which is equivalent to
        losing a
        pound a week.<br>
        <br>
        Or maybe it's the soda pop that you're drinking, or that
        afternoon
        candy bar. Or maybe it's just that you're a carb person and eat
        too
        much of refined carbs like bread, pasta or rice.<br>
        <br>
        All these foods are high in sugar (or in the case of the refined
        carbs,
        easily converted to sugar) and reducing them in your diet will
        help you
        to lose weight much faster.<br>
        <br>
        Instead, try and eat more lean meat and protein like grilled
        chicken or
        fish. Fish like salmon, sardines, mackerel or albacore tuna are
        excellent as not only are they high in protein, they are also
        rich in
        antioxidants and Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Try and eat fish at least
        twice a
        week.<br>
        <br>
        As mentioned, reduce the number of refined carbs you're eating -
        instead of a side of fries, pasta, rice or potatoes, try having
        a fresh
        garden salad with reduced or no-calorie dressing instead.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Plan Your Meals And
          Eat Frequently Throughout The Day</span><br>
        <br>
        After knowing which foods you have to eat (or avoid) to lose
        weight,
        you have to start planning your meals and preparing them in
        advance.<br>
        <br>
        This helps in two ways - firstly, you will be able to buy
        exactly what
        you need at the supermarket without being tempted to buy foods
        that are
        unhealthy; and secondly, you will not be tempted to eat a
        'sinful' meal
        like a double cheeseburger with extra fries if you already have
        your
        meals planned and prepared in advance.<br>
        <br>
        Try to eat about 5 to 6 small meals a day, spread throughout the
        day.
        Three of these meals can be main meals consisting of lean
        protein like
        chicken, fish or eggs and a fresh salad or vegetables. The
        remaining
        meals can be snacks like a cup of natural yogurt with fresh
        fruit or a
        handful of almonds.<br>
        <br>
        The reason for eating frequently is because the process of
        digesting
        solid food is actually thermogenic and will cause your metabolic
        rate
        to increase. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">4) Drink Plenty Of Water</span><br>
        <br>
        Drinking enough water is essential to both good health and
        weight loss
        and chances are, you're not drinking enough of it. Besides, if
        your
        body is dehydrated, it will start retaining water and usually in
        the
        most unflattering of places! Drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of
        water a
        day, more if you're physically active.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">5) Get Some Exercise</span><br>
        <br>
        Although there's no doubting the importance of a solid and
        nutritious
        diet for fast weight loss, you'll have to get some exercise as
        well for
        quicker weight loss.<br>
        <br>
        However, make sure that your workout is intense enough or you're
        just
        wasting your time.<br>
        <br>
        Try and incorporate cardio and resistance training utilizing the
        HIIT
        (High Intensity Interval Training) principles.<br>
        <br>
        A HIIT style workout not only burns calories during your workout
        but
        importantly, also causes your metabolism to be revving high even
        hours
        after your workout.<br>
        <br>
        Resistance training is also important (whether you're a male or
        female)
        as building lean muscle on your body causes your resting
        metabolic rate
        to<br>
        increase.<br>
        <br>
        Studies have shown that consistent weight training can cause a
        person's
        metabolic rate to increase by almost 15%! This means without
        doing
        anything else, an average person can burn an extra 200 - 300
        calories a
        day at rest just by adding lean muscle mass onto their frame.<br>
        <br>
        Ladies, don't worry that resistance training and/or muscle
        building
        will make you look bulkier though. Don't be fooled by pictures
        you see
        on the covers of bodybuilding magazines as those professional
        bodybuilders are at the top of the gene pool when it comes to
        building
        muscle or they are pumped full of anabolic steroids anyway.<br>
        <br>
        In fact, building lean muscle makes you look more streamlined
        and lean
        as muscle takes up less space than fat.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">6) Get Enough Rest
          Between Workouts</span><br>
        <br>
        Make sure you get enough rest between your resistance training
        workouts. You have to understand that muscles only rebuild
        themselves
        and get stronger only while you are at rest, so try to get at
        least a
        day's rest between your workouts.<br>
        <br>
        Also, make sure you get enough sleep at night as well. Not
        getting
        enough sleep may also impede your ability to burn fat.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">7) Be Patient,
          Disciplined And Consistent!</span><br>
        <br>
        Be patient! You didn't put on that excess weight in a day so
        you'll
        have to be realistic and realize that weight loss will not
        happen
        overnight as well.<br>
        <br>
        Be disciplined in your approach to weight loss and that means
        consistently sticking to your diet and exercise plan no matter
        what. No
        excuses!<br>
        <br>
