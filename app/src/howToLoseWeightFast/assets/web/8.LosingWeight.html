        </big></font></p>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>We all need and want to get into better
          physical shape. For
          the majority of us, "getting into better shape" means losing
          that extra
          weight. All the leading health experts tell us that in order
          to lose
          weight we need to eat less and workout more. But what exactly
          does
          "Eating less and Working out more" entail for the average
          person? We
          can go to the gym for hours and eat all our greens yet not
          even lose a
          pound. Eventually any person can get frustrated, blame it on a
          weak
          metabolism and then give up entirely. I feel that frustration!
          I used
          to feel the same way until I learned what I was doing wrong.
          Hopefully
          you can learn from my mistakes and finally lose that extra
          weight!</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma"><big>
        <p>So here are the top 10 reasons I have found for why most
          people are not losing weight:</p>
        <p>1. LACK OF PORTION CONTROL</p>
        <p>This may seem obvious, but unless you are tracking your
          calories each day you may be eating more than you think. The
          average
          female caloric intake should be between 1500-2000 calories a
          day
          depending on factors such as age, metabolism, height, and
          lifestyle and
          for a male the number jumps up to 2,500-3,000 calories a day.</p>
        <p>Most of the meals we eat have enough calories to feed several
          people and that goes double for anytime we eat out. Just for
          your
          information - most restaurants now put calorie information on
          their
          websites and let me just say sometimes it is a real shocker
          when you
          find out that your favorite dish at your favorite restaurant
          uses up
          all of your allowed calories for the entire day.</p>
        <p>For example, one of my favorite restaurants is Cheesecake
          Factory and anytime I go there I always get the Crusted
          Chicken Romano
          and I substitute the spaghetti for vegetables.</p>
        <p><big>&nbsp; &nbsp;<small> *
              Crusted Chicken Romano: 1,610 Calories. (In this case a
              serving size is
              one breast but some places you have to be careful as they
              change the
              serving size to make the number look smaller!)<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * Side of Sauted Spinach: 100
              Calories.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; * Total of 1,710 calories. I am a guy,
              and still that is almost half my daily allowable caloric
              intake in one
              meal! If I didn't substitute the spaghetti, it would've
              been well over
              2,000 calories.<br>
              <br>
              If you're really serious about losing weight, you need to
              get serious
              about your eating correctly. Start by keeping a detailed
              food journal
              for one week, without changing any of your eating habits.
              Be as
              specific as possible and add up your calories for each
              day. You'll be
              surprised how those calories can sneak in when you're not
              keeping track.</small></big></p>

    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>2.
          DRINKING YOUR CALORIES</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Liquid
          calories from alcohol, smoothies, coffee with cream and sugar,
          sweetened juices, teas, and sodas can really deter your weight
          loss
          goals. A recent study found that a staggering 37% of most
          Americans'
          calories came from beverages! Most beverages are loaded with
          sugar or
          fat.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>When
          you drink beverages, you don't compensate the calories by
          eating less
          food. Most beverages quench your thirst and do not affect
          hunger.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Switch
          from high calorie beverages to water, club soda, skim milk,
          and
          unsweetened tea. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation,
          and choose
          the light beer or less calorie laden mixers.</big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>3.
          EATING FAST FOOD</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Take
          out the "s" in fast food and it would be more fitting. This is
          primarily, hands down, the worst kind of food you can eat when
          you are
          trying to lose weight! Fast food is loaded with calories but
          very
          little nutrition. When we eat fast food, it spikes our insulin
          levels
          which promote fat storage. Fast food companies remove the
          nutrients and
          replace it with salt, sugar and fat to not only increase the
          shelf
          life, but to increase their profits.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Studies
          have shown that salt, sugar and fat together triggers the
          brain's
          "reward" system releasing dopamine; very similar to cocaine or
          heroin
          making us slaves to our cravings.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>4.
          NOT GETTING RID OF THE "JUNK" IN YOUR LIFE</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Out
          of sight, out of mind, out of mouth! You have heard it before,
          if you
          are serious about losing weight it takes more than a diet; it
          takes a
          life style change. This is a life style change. Take all the
          junk food
          out of your house and throw it away. 100% of losing weight is
          will
          power and not many of us have the will power to make the
          correct eating
          decisions when we are hungry. Potato chips are a more
          appealing snack
          than hard boiled eggs, cottage cheese or raisins. So help
          yourself by
          getting rid of the junk food and loading up on the healthy
          foods so
          when you do snack, it will be a healthy snack.</big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>5.
          STRESS</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Stress
          is a major contributor to weight gain as well as a lack of
          weight loss.
          Chronic stress can increase production of cortisol, a powerful
          hormone
          which increases appetite, weakens the immune system, releases
          insulin
          as well as promote fat storage around the abdominal region.
          Over long
          periods of time, Cortisol secretion can contribute to weight
          gain,
          Diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and many other
          health
          ailments. Stress is something that we will never be able to
          get rid of
          but we all need to find ways to and reduce stress. It can be
          as simple
          as taking a few minutes a day to relax or meditate, scheduling
          a
          massage, cutting down on work hours, listening to your
          favorite music
          artist or laughing with friends. A wonderful book that I
          highly
          recommend is "Don't Sweat The Small Stuff and its...All Small
          Stuff" by
          Richard Carlson.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big><b>TIP</b>:
          Proper nutrition, Omega 3, Vitamin C and Tea can help reduce
          stress and
          block cortisol production.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>6.
          NOT SWEATING ENOUGH</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>The
          very basics of losing weight are burning more calories than
          you eat.
          The rule of thumb is - To lose one pound a week you need a
          caloric
          deficit of 3500 which equates to about 500 calories a day. You
          can
          achieve this by either eating less food or burning more
          calories but to
          maximize it you have to do both.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Many
          people have the misconception that the longer you are at the
          gym the
          more calories you are going to burn. It doesn't work like
          that. You can
          be at the gym for 2 hours and barely break a sweat and burn
          the same
          amount of calories as someone who is going hard for 30
          minutes.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>You
          have to work hard if you want to change the shape of your body
          and if
          you are a beginner that does not mean you sprint as hard as
          you can for
          30 minutes and then max out on weights. There is nothing that
          will
          break your drive faster than pushing yourself past your
          limits. If you
          want to lose weight and stay motivated, know that it is a
          gradual
          climb. A good indicator of progress is sweat. Your heart rate
          should be
          up and you should be sweating, but it should not be so high
          where you
          cannot talk. The best is a balance of medium-high intensity
          cardio
          exercise along with challenging free weight workouts.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>7.
          NOT SWITCHING IT UP ENOUGH</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Almost
          everyone reaches a weight loss plateau at some point. As your
          body
          adapts to your workouts, it gets harder and harder to lose
          those last
          few pounds. Your body is made to adapt to almost any situation
          and
          that, unfortunately, includes your work outs. Over a period of
          weeks or
          months your body becomes more efficient at working out and,
          therefore,
          doesn't expend as many calories doing it. If you don't change
          your
          workout routine, your progress will slow down and eventually
          stop.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big><b>SOME
            COMMON REASONS FOR PLATEAUS INCLUDE: </b></big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big><b>Doing
            the same workouts over and over</b>.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Tahoma"><big>Your body needs to be challenged in
            order to
            progress, so make sure you're changing some part of your
            program every
            4-6 weeks. It could be something as simple as changing the
            order of
            your workout, intensity, or duration but for better results
            it's best
            to change your entire workout.</big></font></li>
    </ul>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big><strong>Not
            eating enough calories</strong>.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Tahoma"><big>If your body doesn't have enough fuel
            to sustain
            your level of activity, you can actually stop losing weight.
            Your body
            needs calories, especially protein to build muscle (also
            burns fat) and
            carbohydrates for energy to get through a strenuous workout.
            It's best
            to stick to lean protein or protein powders and slow burning
            carbohydrates such as vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</big></font></li>
    </ul>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big><strong>Overtraining</strong>.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Tahoma"><big>If muscles are not given enough time
            to recover
            before another workout is repeated then the muscles
            progressively
            become smaller. For weight loss this means a gradual decline
            in lean
            tissue, thus lowering your metabolism. Solution - do not
            work out the
            same body parts on consecutive days. After a workout you
            need to rest
            those muscles for 1 to 2 days in order for them to fully
            recover. I
            would suggest not doing cardio more than 3 times a week and
            lifting the
            same body part more than 2 times a week. This allows your
            body plenty
            of time to rest.</big></font></li>
    </ul>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>8.
          NOT GETTING ENOUGH SLEEP</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>In
          the recent study, Sleep Linked to Weight Gain the American
          Academy of
          Sleep Medicine found that twins who slept less than 7 hours or
          more
          than 9 hours a night were more likely to gain weight than
          their
          identical twin that slept 7-8.9 hours a night.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>The
          body repairs itself when you are resting and lack of sleep
          puts stress
          on your body. When you continually deprive your body of sleep
          it
          releases our old "friend" cortisol. Too much cortisol in the
          body
          causes the release of insulin which promotes fat storage.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Getting
          enough sleep is crucial if you are trying to lose weight, not
          just
          because of how it affects you physically, but mentally as
          well. Lack of
          sleep makes you cranky, confused and can even make you feel
          depressed
          or angry and all of it can eliminate your motivation to go to
          the gym.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Make
          sleep a priority by trying to get to bed at the same time each
          night,
          shooting for about 7-8 hours, if possible. Having some bedtime
          rituals
          such as a hot bath or reading a book can help you unwind
          before bed.</big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>9.
          YOU THINK YOU ARE EATING REALLY HEALTHY, WHEN IN REALITY YOU
          ARE NOT</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma">
    </font>
    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Do
          your food products consist of massive amounts of labels
          reading
          "Healthy", "Lean", "Diet", or "Low carb"? These buzz words
          don't mean
          anything unless we look at the bigger picture. Many of these
          companies
          will lower the sodium, reduce the carbohydrates or remove the
          fat in
          order to satisfy their legal obligation, but will turn around
          and load
          it up with sugar or other unnatural products to make it taste
          better so
          we keep feeding our addiction and consume empty calories.
          Also, be very
          wary of the "serving size", many companies can make nutrition
          facts
          appear "healthy" by just reducing the serving size.</big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>The

          walls of
          the grocery store in product section, meat department and
          dairy
          freezer. If you must buy processed foods you must look at the
          nutritional facts. Especially with frozen foods or prepared
          foods, be
          wary of: serving size, sodium content, sugar, carbohydrates,
          calories
          and calories from fat. You want to make sure that it is no
          more than
          what you would want had you prepared the meal yourself.</big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Break
          the fast, meaning you have not eaten in hours and your body is

          eaters. There
          is a misconception that skipping breakfast or any meal saves
          calories.
          In reality, most people who skip meals are so famished that
          they end up
          snacking on junk or end up binge eating.</big></font></p>

    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Strive
          for five small meals a day. This will keep your metabolism
          high and
          your insulin levels stable so you are not tempted to binge eat
          or head
          for the nearest vending machine. Always start your day with a
          healthy
          breakfast, but be careful and choose wisely.</big></font></p>

          healthy breakfast should contain both protein and fiber.
          People who
          start the day with a protein-rich breakfast consume 200 fewer
          calories
          a day than those who eat a carb-heavy breakfast and fiber
          helps you
          feel full longer.</big></font></p>
