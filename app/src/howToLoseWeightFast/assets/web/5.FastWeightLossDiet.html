    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>Most people realize that in order to
          achieve certain
          fitness-oriented goals, they will need to pay special
          attention to what
          they are eating. As simple as this seems, it is often one of
          the most
          confusing aspects of a fitness plan. I mean what fad diet are
          we going
          to try this week? Adkins, South Beach and the hard to kill
          Cabbage Soup
          Diet are a few of the more popular fad diets making the rounds
          these
          days. Now don't get me wrong, not all of these diets are
          totally
          useless, but overall, fad diets are responsible for some very
          unhealthy
          habits. Not to mention the fact that the majority of all
          dieters fad
          and otherwise, will ultimately gain all of the weight back!
          Some will
          even gain more weight back than what they started with.</big></font></p>

        <p>Hopefully after reading this article, you will understand the
          basics of nutrition and realize just how simple creating an
          effective
          and healthy nutritional plan can be.</p>
        <p>In order to get started, you will need to arm yourself with a
          few things. Grab a pen, some paper, a calculator and a scale.</p>
        <p>First, we will need to define your goals. What do you want to
          achieve from this program? Do you want to lose 20lbs, 50lbs or
          even
          100lbs? Do you want to gain 20, 50 or 100 lbs? It really
          doesn't matter
          how crazy your goals may seem now. I assure you that if given
          the
          proper amount of time, any goal is within your reach! Just
          write down
          the first few things that come to your mind. Next to each one
          of your
          goals, write what your motivation for attaining them is?</p>
        <p>Maybe you want to look good for a wedding. Or perhaps you
          have
          been ordered by a doctor to loose weight or else! Now I
          realize that
          this may seem like a very unimportant part of the equation,
          but I speak
          from experience when I say, no goal will ever be achieved
          unless you
          can understand exactly why it is important to you. Nobody else
          needs to
          know what makes you tick, but in order for you to achieve
          success at
          anything in life, you must master this step.</p>
        <p>Nutrition 101</p>
        <p>Now that you're on the track to success, you will need to
          learn what components make up a successful nutritional plan.
          Bear with
          me as I explain the basics of nutrition. Everything that you
          eat is
          made up of calories. Calories are fuel for the body. Calories
          are
          responsible for providing fuel for the body to do everything
          from basic
          body functions to more advanced functions like muscle
          contraction and
          exercise. So basically, calories are energy. It is extremely
          important
          to be able to accurately estimate your body's caloric needs.</p>
        <p>BMR</p>
        <p>The most accurate method for estimating your caloric needs is
          a simple equation involving your estimated body fat % and
          estimated
          activity level. This equation will lead you to your BMR or
          basal
          metabolic rate. The value that you get for your BMR can be use
          to
          calculate your Total Daily Expended Energy. Basically, your
          total daily
          expended energy is the amount of fuel, (calories), needed to
          maintain
          the weight that you are currently at, at the body composition
          that you
          are currently at.</p>
        <p>In order to lose weight, you must create a calorie deficit.
          In
          order to gain weight, you must increase your total caloric
          intake.</p>
        <p>Very simple, straight-forward stuff.</p>
        <p>Now you have a place to begin. You will no longer be guessing
          at how many calories you have to eat. You can calculate
          exactly how
          many your body needs and adjust from there.</p>
        <p>In order to calculate you basal metabolic rate and your total
          daily expended energy, simply plug in your estimated % body
          fat and
          lean body mass in kg, into the Katch-Mcardle formula.</p>
        <p>BMR = 370+(21.6 x Lean Body Mass kg)</p>
        <p>Now select your estimated activity multiplier from the table
          below.</p>
        <p>Activity Muiltipliers</p>
        <p>Sedentary = BMR X 1.2 (little or no exercise, desk job)</p>
        <p>Lightly active = BMR X 1.375 (light exercise/sports 1-3
          days/wk)</p>
        <p>Mod. active = BMR X 1.55 (moderate exercise/sports 3-5
          days/wk)</p>
        <p>Very active = BMR X 1.725 (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days/wk)</p>
        <p>Extra active = BMR X 1.9 (hard daily exercise/sports &amp;
          physical job or 2X day training, i.e marathon, contest etc.)</p>
        <p>After you have established your BMR and selected you activity
          multiplier from the chart above, simply multiply your activity
          multiplier by your BMR. This value is your total daily
          expended energy.
          From here, you will need to apply a little bit of skill in
          order to
          adjust your value to achieve your goals. For most people, if
          your goal
          is to lose weight, you will need to adjust you caloric intake
          down from
          the TDEE value somewhere between 5 and 20%. If your goal is to
          gain
          muscle mass, then you will need to gradually increase your
          caloric
          intake. Again I would recommend making any changes to your
          TDEE value
          gradually. Generally speaking, an increase of 5-25% is
          typically a good
          place to start.</p>
        <p>Before we go any further, it is critical that you realize a
          few important functions of the human body. The more fuel you
          eat,
          (calories), the more energy your body will be able to expend.
          The human
          body is a very complex organism. You must eat the right amount
          of
          calories to fuel your daily activity or your body, as clever
          as it is,
          will begin to store as many of the calories that you eat as
          body fat.
          This is not what you are looking for, unless you see a future
          in sumo
          wrestling down the road.</p>
        <p>So, what really happens when your caloric intake is too low?
          Your body, going back to the prehistoric days will revert to
          the flight
          or fight mode. Not knowing when it's next meal will come, your
          body
          will attempt to store any and all of your calories as body fat
          for
          future use, after all it may not eat again for days. This is
          one of the
          basic reasons that starvation diets rarely work. Not only will
          you more
          than likely gain weight, but your body will begin to
          canabolize itself
          and try to turn protein (muscle mass), into energy. This
          conversion
          process is one of the most inefficient ways for your body to
          generate
          energy. You in turn, will feel the effects of this
          inefficiency as you
          begin to feel groggy and tired all of the time. To put it
          bluntly, you
          will lose muscle mass and gain body fat at the same time.</p>
        <p>Now, back to the basic nutrition lesson. As we are all aware
          by now, calories are the fuel for the body. You probably
          realize that
          calories come from food, but lets take it a little bit further
          and
          explain what types of food contain what types of calories.
          There are
          six basic nutrient classes. Protein, Carbohydrate, Fat,
          Vitamins,
          Minerals and Water. Each nutrient is utilized in the human
          body for
          very specific tasks. The body as amazing as it is, will often
          try to
          manipulate certain types of responses from these nutrients in
          order to
          sustain life, especially when incorrect proportions of
          nutrients are
          consumed.</p>
        <p>Protein</p>
        <p>Protein serves numerous functions in our bodies. It is the
          major structural component of the cell. It is also used for
          growth,
          repair and maintenance of body tissues. Another important
          function that
          protein plays in the body is the ability to form antibodies
          for disease
          protection. And as stated previously, protein can be used to
          create
          energy, although not very efficiently. Protein contains 4
          calories per
          gram. Although there are many benefits to consuming protein,
          especially
          for bodybuilders and people wishing to increase lean body
          mass, it is
          important to realize that protein is only a piece of the
          nutrition
          puzzle. Only paying attention to your protein intake and
          neglecting
          other areas of your nutritional plan, will guarantee that you
          will not
          achieve your fitness goals.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates also serve many functions in the human body.
          Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the human
          body,
          especially during high-intensity exercise. Carbohydrates
          regulate fat
          and protein metabolism, as well as providing the exclusive
          energy
          source for the nervous system. Carbohydrates, like protein
          contain 4
          calories per gram.</p>
        <p>Fats</p>
        <p>Fats are responsible for maintaining proper brain function as
          well as supplying energy to the body. The main responsibility
          of fats
          in the human body is to provide a constant supply of energy.
          Because
          the body must be prepared for times when energy consumption is
          minimal,
          the human body tends to place a supply of fat on the body for
          later
          use. This is also why it can be difficult to lose body fat
          after it has
          been stored there. When you try to lose fat, you are actually
          working
          against your bodies instincts.</p>
        <p>Dietary fats have taken a bad rap in recent years due to the
          amount of publicity given to obesity and heart disease. The
          most
          important thing to remember here, is that saturated fats and
          trans-fatty acids are bad for the body and unsaturated fats
          can be good
          for the body.</p>
        <p>Saturated fats come primarily from animal sources. Saturated
          fats are responsible for clogging arteries, elevating
          cholesterol and a
          slew of undesirable side effects. Saturated fats come
          primarily from
          meats and manufactured and processed foods.</p>
        <p>Polyunsaturated and Monounsaturated fats, "healthy fats",
          come
          from sources such as flaxseed, safflower, grapeseed and olive
          oils.
          Polyunsatuated fats serve as the building blocks from which
          cells are
          produced. It is important to consume an adequate amount of
          these
          "healthy" fats for proper bodily function.</p>
        <p>Healthy or unhealthy, each gram of fat contains 9 calories.</p>
        <p>As you can see, fats are the most calorie dense nutrient,
          more
          than doubling up on carbohydrates and protein. Because of
          this, it is
          important to not only limit your consumption of fats to avoid
          an excess
          of calories, but also to make sure to eat primarily "healthy"
          types of
          fats.</p>
        <p>Vitamins and Minerals</p>
        <p>Vitamins and minerals are often overlooked components of any
          nutritional plan. Vitamins are responsible for promoting
          growth and
          maintaining health. Minerals are essential for normal cellular
          function. Together vitamins and minerals create an environment
          primed
          for optimum performance. Although not very exotic, vitamins
          and mineral
          supplements, when consistently taken, can bolster your immune
          system,
          increase your energy levels and promote overall body function
          and
          health. I personally do not believe that you need to break the
          bank
          here, when looking for a good vitamin/ mineral supplement.
          Many
          excellent vitamin/mineral supplements are on the market today
          for a
          fraction of what they would have cost you 5-10 years ago.</p>
        <p>Water</p>
        <p>Water is the last of the six nutrient classes discussed here,
          but certainly not the least. Water, makes up roughly 60% of
          the human
          body. Do I really need to explain any further? Water serves as
          the
          lubricant by which body function is driven. With out enough
          water, you
          will die. At the very least, without consuming enough water
          throughout
          the day, you will certainly not be able to reach your fitness/
          health
          goals. It is recommended that training athletes consume a
          minimum of 24
          oz of water per hour of exercise. Regardless of your goals, I
          personally believe that a minimum of 1 gallon of water per day
          should
          be the goal.</p>
        <p>Conclusion</p>
        <p>Hopefully, you have gained a better understanding of the
          important role that nutrition plays in achieving your fitness
          goals.
          You simply can't neglect this area of your program, without
          consequences. To briefly recap, establish your maintenance
          calorie
          needs. After you have established this value, take a look at
          your
          goals. If your goal is to lose weight, realize that you must
          create a
          calorie deficit. You will need to expend more energy than you
          are
          consuming. The only two ways to accomplish this are to
          increase you
          activity levels via cardiovascular exercise to burn more
          calories, or
          to eat fewer calories. If your goal is to gain weight, you
          will need to
          increase your caloric intake. Typically, you will want to
          continue to
          live an active life, including cardiovascular exercise. In
          order to
          increase this value enough to see a measurable difference, you
          will
          need to gradually increase your caloric intake over time.
          Typically 500
          to 1000 extra calories per day, should get you headed in the
          right
          direction. If you are happy with where you currently are,
          simply eat
          enough calories to match your maintenance level.</p>
