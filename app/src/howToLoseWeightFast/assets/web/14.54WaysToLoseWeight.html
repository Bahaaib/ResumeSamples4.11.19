      </font></div>
    <font face="Tahoma"><br>
      Try to add as many of these tips to your daily routine, and you
      will surely be well on the way to a slimmer, healthier you. We
      don’t get fat “overnight” – so you should expect it to take a
      certain amount of time to lose that weight again, but don’t give
      up! Persistence, Determination and Grit - They should be your
      watchwords. These tips work – if you stick to your plan!<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminate one tablespoon of fat a day and you
      will lose 10 pounds in a year.<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid strange fad diets—if you can’t eat that
      way for the rest of your life, don’t waste your time or your
      health.<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit alcohol consumption - each serving
      contains 100 to 150 calories.<br>
      <br>
      4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat fruit at least twice a day.<br>
      <br>
      5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep a food diary about your food choices,
      indicating how hungry you are each time you eat. Pay particular
      attention to your level of hunger when you snack.<br>
      <br>
      6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform aerobic exercise a minimum of 30
      minutes three times a week. Log this on your food diary. Aerobic
      means any exercise that increases your breathing and heart rate.
      Walking is fine! Do only what you can to begin with. If you have
      other health problems, consult your doctor before embarking on any
      strong physical exercise.<br>
      <br>
      7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gradually increase the length and frequency
      of your workouts.<br>
      <br>
      8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weigh yourself no more than twice a week. And
      do it in the morning after going to the bathroom – it’s the most
      accurate reading.<br>
      <br>
      9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give yourself a non-food reward for every 5
      pounds lost.<br>
      <br>
      10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slow down your eating speed—make meals last
      at least 20 minutes. Try eating with the other hand or taking a
      sip of water between bites.<br>
      <br>
      11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use smaller plates.<br>
      <br>
      12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring your lunch to work at least three
      times a week.<br>
      <br>
      13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start to strength train twice a week as your
      fitness improves. Building muscle increases your metabolism and
      forces your body to use fat, not muscle, when you’re cutting back
      on calories. Cut down on carbohydrates and stick to lean white
      meat and fish, and you will notice vast improvements here.<br>
      <br>
      14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stop eating while watching television.<br>
      <br>
      15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have someone else put away leftovers.<br>
      <br>
      16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy a good low-fat, low-calorie cookbook or
      magazine subscription.<br>
      <br>
      17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try two new reduced-calorie recipes a month.<br>
      <br>
      18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IMPORTANT - Eat breakfast daily. This
      suppresses the appetite for most of the day and provides fuel for
      the brain while at work or looking after the kids! You will feel
      better and have more energy all day if you eat a low fat cereal in
      the morning.<br>
      <br>
      19.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t read while eating.<br>
      <br>
      20.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have a sweet treat once a week.<br>
      <br>
      21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep healthful snacks at home and at work.<br>
      <br>
      22.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limit your cheese consumption to reduce fat
      and saturated fat—use cheese and lunchmeat with less than 5 grams
      of fat per ounce.<br>
      <br>
      23.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add calorie counting or fat-gram counting to
      your food diary for a few weeks if your weight loss is slowing
      down. Maybe you’re missing something.<br>
      <br>
      24.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Substitute herbs and spices for salt.<br>
      <br>
      25.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shop for food when you are not hungry, and
      use a shopping list.<br>
      <br>
      26.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Replace ground beef with ground turkey or
      soy crumbles in dishes such as spaghetti. Don’t skip the protein
      in your meals; find a leaner substitute.<br>
      <br>
      27.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat three vegetables a day.<br>
      <br>
      28.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always eat sitting down.<br>
      <br>
      29.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request that your family and friends respect
      your efforts to lose weight and get fit—beware of loving
      “sabotage.”<br>
      <br>
      30.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take a walk when you’re stressed or angry.<br>
      <br>
      31.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eat two dairy products a day—be aware of
      your calcium intake. Select low-fat or nonfat dairy products to
      reduce fat calories.<br>
      <br>
      32.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order dressings and sauces on the side and
      apply them with a fork.<br>
      <br>
      33.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase your fiber intake—chose whole-grain
      breads, cereals and pasta products, legumes, and raw fruits and
      vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      34.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add slow-down food to your meals—crunchy
      vegetables, a large glass of water, hot soup or beverages, or
      fresh fruit to fill you up.<br>
      <br>
      35.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cook with chicken broth, nonstick cooking
      spray, wine or water.<br>
      <br>
      36.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day.<br>
      <br>
      37.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shrink portion sizes of meats and starches,
      and pile on the vegetables.<br>
      <br>
      38.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask how the food is prepared when ordering
      in a restaurant.<br>
      <br>
      39.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose low-fat frozen yogurt or frozen juice
      bars instead of ice cream. Be careful of the portion size - these
      foods still have calories!<br>
      <br>
      40.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select clear broth- or tomato-based soups
      over white soups.<br>
      <br>
      41.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep the junk foods out of sight in your
      home and workplace.<br>
      <br>
      42.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take walking shoes or a jump rope with you
      when you travel to keep up with your exercise.<br>
      <br>
      43.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re getting off track, try to pre-plan
      your food intake for the next three days by writing it down.<br>
      <br>
      44.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buy frozen diet dinners with 10 grams of fat
      or less and 800 milligrams of sodium or less.<br>
      <br>
      45.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid batter coating or breading.<br>
      <br>
      46.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use two egg whites in baking instead of one
      whole egg.<br>
      <br>
      47.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretch during television commercials—arm
      circles, leg lifts, head tilts, etc.<br>
      <br>
      48.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eliminate the butter on your rolls or
      popcorn.<br>
      <br>
      49.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learn to say “no” gracefully when a friend
      or relative offers you a second helping.<br>
      <br>
      50.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose pizza with vegetable toppings rather
      than high-fat meats, such as sausage and pepperoni.<br>
      <br>
      51.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask for less cheese. Have you ever tried
      tomato pie?<br>
      <br>
      52.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose cooking techniques that keep fat to a
      minimum, such as baking, grilling, broiling, roasting or steaming.<br>
      <br>
      53.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Add more low-fat soy products to your diet
      for the soy protein and health benefits.<br>
      <br>
      54.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgive yourself when you slip—and make the
      next food choice a healthy one.<br>
