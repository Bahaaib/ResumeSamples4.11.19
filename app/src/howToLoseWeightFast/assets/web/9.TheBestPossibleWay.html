    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>On January 1, millions of people will
          make a resolution to
          lose weight. While this is a popular and great resolution to
          make, most
          people will go about it completely in the wrong way.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma"><big>
        <p>Many will go out and buy the newest, hottest and most talked
          about diet. Others will join a gym, hire a Personal Trainer,
          or hire a
          Nutritionist. Some will seek out a Hypnotherapist in this
          quest for
          weight loss. Let us break down the pros and cons of each, and
          then I'll
          give you some idea of what the best approach to make would be.</p>
        <p>Going on a diet. This is the worst possible move you can make
          if you're trying to lose weight and keep it off. If you want
          to lose
          weight fairly fast, and don't mind gaining it all back and
          then some
          afterward, then it may be for you. But, the short term
          gratification of
          losing weight from dieting will wreak havoc on your body and
          mind, both
          physically and psychologically.</p>
        <p>In a government study, it was shown that over 96% of people
          who diet fail after 6 months. In a different study, it was
          shown that
          people who dieted gained more weight over a period of 3 years
          than
          those who didn't diet. And both groups weighed the same
          initially.</p>
        <p>So with that being said, "Why in the world would somebody go
          on a diet." Well, the dieting industry spends billions of
          dollars each
          year on advertising revenue to make you believe their product
          will work
          for you. They work very hard to produce powerful emotions of
          fear,
          lust, and greed to its viewers. As a result, consumers spend
          nearly $40
          Billion Dollars each year on products that are proven to not
          work. So,
          let's get diets out of the picture.</p>
        <p>Joining a gym. There's nothing wrong with joining a gym, as
          long as you have the right expectations. A study showed that
          over 90%
          of people who join a gym have no idea of what they're doing
          once they
          get there. So you pay between $40.00-$100.00 a month, go a few
          times
          and never go back, all the while being locked into a year long
          contract
          in most cases.</p>
        <p>If you're already in pretty good shape, and you're one of the
          less than 10% of people who know what to do, then the gym may
          be for
          you. But, if you're one of the 90% + of people, understand
          that gyms
          bank on the fact that you will not know what you're doing once
          you get
          there. You'll either hire a trainer because you may get hurt,
          see
          little results, or you wont go back. Either way, the gym makes
          out.</p>
        <p>Hire a personal trainer. This could be an incredible
          investment as long as you find the right Personal Trainer or
          Personal
          Training Company. Unfortunately, the standards of the Personal
          Training
          Industry are extremely low. Attempts have been made recently
          to improve
          the standards, and it is working; however, too many trainers
          are still
          falling through the cracks. Nowadays, one can call themselves
          a
          Personal Trainer after taking a one day online course and
          earning a
          certification.</p>
        <p>An experienced Personal Trainer can help you attain results
          in
          a safe, and fast manner. You just need to be sure you're
          getting the
          right person or company. Some of the best questions to ask a
          potential
          trainer are:</p>
        <p>1. What is your experience and credentials?
          <br>
          Insist on a highly trained professional in the field of
          exercise
          physiology. Today there are literally hundreds of personal
          training
          certifying agencies, most of which do not require hands on
          experience
          or a comprehensive exam and evaluation. Certifications that we
          recognize as acceptable are: NPTI (National Personal Training
          Institute), ACSM ( American College of Sports Medicine), ACE
          (American
          Council on Exercise), AFAA (Aerobics and Fitness Association
          of
          America, and NSCA (National Strength and Conditioning
          Association).</p>
        <p>A personal trainer must also have experience in the field.
          What makes a personal trainer acceptable is their ability to
          handle and
          design programs for people of all ages, sizes, and
          disabilities. This
          not only comes from proper education, but from experience
          dealing with
          many different clients as well.</p>
        <p>2. Are you insured?
          <br>
          Statistics show that 85% of all personal trainers who operate
          under
          their own name do not carry adequate professional liability
          insurance.
          This not only shows a complete disregard for the integrity of
          the
          Personal Training Industry, it shows a lack of professionalism
          for the
          trainer or company.</p>
        <p>3. How long have you been in business?
          <br>
          This is very important. Most personal trainers work part time
          for a
          company, or are sole proprietors struggling to make ends meet.
          The last
          thing you'll want is to see amazing results with a trainer,
          but then
          find out they have to find another job.</p>
        <p>Find an experienced trainer who has been doing this for at
          least 2 years, or find a Personal Training Company that's been
          in
          business for over 5 years. By hiring a Company, if one trainer
          quits or
          becomes unavailable, they'll more than likely have someone
          else to step
          in so you won't skip a beat.</p>
        <p>4. How will you measure my progress?
          <br>
          Any Personal Trainer who wants you to see results and stick
          with the
          program will offer some type of fitness evaluation and
          progress checks.
          This is a very important element to a personal training
          program. Most
          people want to see not only visually, but on paper what
          they're
          spending their hard-earned money on.</p>
        <p>5. What's your availability?
          <br>
          One of the key elements for getting results is consistency.
          When hiring
          a personal trainer or personal training company, an important
          consideration is the availability and flexibility of the
          trainer or
          company. If you need to reschedule an appointment, the trainer
          or
          company should have the flexibility to either reschedule at an
          appropriate time, or have another trainer available to fill in
          your
          extra day.</p>
        <p>6. What are your rates and terms?
          <br>
          One of the reasons that the personal trainer is not ranked up
          there
          with other professionals in their fields in terms of respect
          and
          credibility is the fact that too many sell themselves short.
          Back in
          the 70's, health clubs offered personal training for free.</p>
        <p>Today you can find a personal trainer for anywhere between
          $40.00-$300.00 per session. The bottom line is that you get
          what you
          pay for. If you are seeking a lower cost personal trainer, 9
          out of 10
          times you will get a less experienced individual who is in
          jeopardy of
          having to switch careers.</p>
        <p>On the other side, if you come across a trainer who is
          charging very high rates, they should not only have many years
          of
          experience, but something else to offer besides exercise
          instruction
          only.</p>
        <p>While hiring a Personal Trainer can give you tremendous
          benefits, please beware of who you invite into your home and
          your life.
          Make sure the Trainer or the Company is reputable, is insured,
          has been
          in business for a good length of time, charges an appropriate
          fee, and
          can provide their credentials.</p>
        <p>Hiring a Nutritionist or Dietitian.
          <br>
          Let's face it, most people who want to lose weight already
          know what
          food is good for them and what food is bad for them. They
          already know
          that pizza is high in fat and fast food is high in calories.
          They know
          they should be drinking water, eating smaller meals through
          their day,
          and avoiding high fat foods. Why then would one spend
          $50.00-$200.00/hour on a Dietitian or Nutritionist?</p>
        <p>Well, if you need accountability, they can help. If you have
          any allergies to food, medical or digestive issues, they can
          help. If
          you have absolutely no idea of what's good for you or bad for
          you, then
          they can help.</p>
        <p>Now the same applies to Nutritionists and Dietitians that
          apply to personal trainers. Make sure you ask the same
          questions before
          inviting someone to help you with what you put into your
          mouth.</p>
        <p>Going to see a Hypnotherapist.
          <br>
          You may be surprised, but this is one of the most effective
          ways to
          lose weight and keep it off. Hypnotherapy helps to engage
          one's
          subconscious mind, and input healthy suggestions so one would
          take
          automatic actions to help them lose weight. Now, I only have
          one
          problem with many Hypnotherapists or Self Hypnosis Tapes out
          there.
          Again, Hypnotherapy helps to engage the Subconscious Mind. But
          what
          about somebody's conscious mind?</p>
        <p>I've seen Hypnotherapists and Self Hypnosis tapes telling
          someone that they look slim, weigh 120lbs, and are wearing a
          size 1
          dress while they're in a state of hypnosis. Well, while the
          subconscious mind may be able to allow this information in, if
          someone
          weighs 300lbs, and is a size 30, their conscious mind will
          definitely
          have a problem with this.</p>
        <p>If someone's conscious mind is working against their
          subconscious mind, the results will be lessened greatly. A
          good
          Hypnotherapist for Weight Loss should have a background in
          either
          Nutrition, Exercise, or both. Then they'll be able to provide
          you with
          an easy to follow plan, and help to embed the appropriate
          information
          into your subconscious mind. They'll also give you realistic
          expectations that both your Conscious and Subconscious mind
          will be
          able to accept.</p>
        <p>So, what's the absolute best way to lose weight and keep it
          off? Well, that depends on your situation. If you're in decent
          physical
          shape, and want to lose a couple of vanity pounds, then go
          join a gym
          or hire a personal trainer. If you have no idea of what foods
          are good
          and bad for you, or have a digestive, medical or allergy
          issues, then
          seek out a Nutritionist or Dietitian.</p>
        <p>If you have more than 30lbs to lose and have struggled with
          your weight for a good length of time, then either a Personal
          Trainer
          coming to your home, or a Hypnotherapist may be a good fit for
          you.
          Whatever You Do, Do Not Go On A Diet!</p>
        <p>If you're more than 30lbs overweight, have struggled for a
          while, have committed acts of self-sabotage and have no idea
          why,
          already know what foods are good for you and bad for you,
          tried dieting
          and exercise and failed, and don't know where else to turn,
          you're in
          luck.</p>
        <p>You may not see it as luck if you've struggled for so long
          with such a significant issue, but believe me, you're in luck.
          I can
          say this because there is finally a new way of utilizing the
          Power of
          Hypnotherapy, NLP, and Instinctive Training to make changes on
          unconscious levels. It addresses all areas of weight loss.
          It's a way
          that will transform your life in more areas than just your
          health and
          weight. And for that, this can be a lucky day for you.</p>
        <p>By utilizing Hypnotherapy, along with Instinctive Training
          and
          NLP, it'll help to change your inner dialogue. Whether you
          know it or
          not, you think over 60,000 thoughts each and every day. If you
          struggle
          with your weight, I guarantee that many of those thoughts are
          self-defeating. Most of your thoughts just come and go, and
          you'll
          never take notice of.</p>
        <p>Some you acknowledge and take action on. What's important to
          know is that close to 90% of your thoughts are the ones that
          just come
          and go. And it's in those 90% of unconscious thoughts that
          make you do
          90% of what you do on a daily basis.</p>
        <p>By changing your inner dialogue, you can experience life as a
          thin person, at least mentally. Once that's accomplished your
          body has
          no choice but to follow. You can't do it the other way around.
          You
          can't say, "Well, once I get thin, then I'll be happy with
          myself."
          This does not work, ever. <br>
          The system addresses all facets of the mind, and implements a
          plan
          based on your primal instincts for activity and eating. It
          helps
          produce weight loss that you will never think about.</p>
        <p>Imagine losing weight and not knowing how you're doing it?
          Imagine eating what you want and still losing weight?</p>
        <p>This is precisely what the system does for its users.
          Whichever route you decide to take for your resolution, I wish
          you the
          best of luck. Please do not waste your time, your money, or
          your
          metabolism on dieting. It doesn't work and you'll probably be
          worse off
          than if you did nothing.</p>
        <p>I am working diligently to make a push to enhance the lives
          of
          all of whom I come into contact with, both physically and
          mentally. I'm
          been booked for the past 3 years, and can't possibly make an
          impact on
          a scale that I'd like to. This is my reason for developing
          this system.</p>
        <p>Whatever amount of weight you'd like to lose, or whatever
          your
          age, height, or situation in your life, utilizing Hypnotherapy
          along
          with Instinctive Training, and NLP can transform your life.</p>
        <p>And yes, if you choose to, you can follow this route in
          conjunction with a Personal Trainer. I wouldn't recommend
          using a
          Dietitian or Nutritionist with the system unless you have a
          medical or
          emotional reason to do so.</p>
        <p>Best of luck and I hope you achieve whatever it is that you
          desire.</p>

        <p><small><small><small>As a Clinical
                Hypnotherapist, Sports Nutritionist, and highly sought
                after personal

                Mind-Body connection as
                it relates to weight loss in particular. Damien's vast
                experience and

        <p><small><small><small>Damien believes that
                the long term answer to weight loss has nothing to do
                with motivation,
                or lack thereof. It has nothing to do with genetics,
                with food, or even
                a lack of exercise. The answer lies deep in the
                subconscious minds of
                all people who struggle with their weight. And that's
                exactly the area
                that the Instinctive Weight Loss System targets. You can
