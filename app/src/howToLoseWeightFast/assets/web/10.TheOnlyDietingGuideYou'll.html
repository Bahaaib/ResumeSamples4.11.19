        <p>Medical authorities, doctors and nutritionists, wrote most of
          these diet books. Many of them contradict one another. Who are
          we to
          believe? What are we to believe? One fellow even wrote a diet
          book
          titled, "Are You Confused."</p>
        <p>Let's analyze an overweight individual. Except in rare cases,
          an excessive intake of food results in the body storing the
          calories it
          does not use for kinetic energy (energy in motion) as
          potential energy
          (energy awaiting use) in the form of body fat, resulting in an
          overweight condition.</p>
        <p>In other words, people who are overweight eat too much.</p>
        <p><strong>The World's Greatest Diet in Two Words</strong></p>
        <p>The solution is simple, and obvious. No magic about it and
          everyone knows the answer. It can be stated in two words: eat
          less.</p>
        <p>How easy.</p>
        <p>How difficult!</p>
        <p>Let's explore the difficulty; for there are many insidious
          forces at work here. First off, we will examine the body's
          viewpoint
          with respect to food. Whatever it is within the body that
          defines that
          hollow feeling in the stomach as a need for food is one of the
          basic
          problems.</p>
        <p>Since analogies and metaphors often bring answers in an
          abstract form that leads to a clearer understanding, let's
          construct
          one now.</p>
        <p><strong>Two Types of Energy, Potential and Kinetic</strong></p>
        <p>As stated, there are two basic types of energy, potential and
          kinetic. Potential energy is energy contained and awaiting
          use. Kinetic
          energy is energy in motion.</p>
        <p>Say that you have an old-fashioned watch with a mainspring.
          You tighten the spring by inserting a key in the proper place
          on the
          watch and turning it to coil the watch spring tightly.
          Transference of
          energy takes place. You transfer the energy of your fingers to
          the key,
          to the gears, to the mainspring, where energy is stored.</p>
        <p>As the spring slowly uncoils the energy becomes kinetic,
          causing the hands to move so that you can tell the time. Once
          you have
          turned the key so that the spring is fully wound, it would be
          difficult
          to turn it any more.</p>
        <p>Imagine what would happen to the watch if you were to take a
          pair of pliers and, using all of your strength, turn the key
          again, and
          then again, and then once more.</p>
        <p>Your timepiece would ultimately burst into a mass of screws,
          wire, and metal bits as the overwound mainspring, which cannot
          contain
          all the energy forced into it, finally flies all over the
          place.</p>
        <p>Over winding was the main cause of broken watches in the
          early
          part of the twentieth century before tiny clutches were
          devised to take
          the pressure off the gear system and make over winding
          impossible.</p>
        <p>Now let us see how that metaphor applies to people. Food is
          potential energy. You use this energy (turn it kinetic) when
          you walk,
          when you talk, when you think, when you eat. You even use a
          portion of
          it lying in bed staring at the ceiling. You might say that the
          equivalent to winding a watch would be feeding yourself.</p>
        <p>It takes much less food than is generally thought to produce
          the energy that most people need.</p>
        <p>Intellectually, you know that after a good breakfast, an
          apple
          or other piece of fruit would make for a wholesome light
          lunch. Why
          consume a lunch that would adequately feed some people for two
          days?
          Certainly not for the food value. What then?</p>
        <p>Here Are a Few of the Reasons that You Overeat: Guilt.
          Socializing. Security. Substitution. Purposeful distortion of
          the way
          you look. Need for love. Guilt</p>
        <p>There are those people who feel that because so many people
          can't afford even the basic sustenance to keep their children
          alive, it
          would be a sin not to eat every bite of food placed in front
          of them.
          Then they eat far past the point of satisfying hunger.</p>
        <p>There are also those who feel that the richer (and fattening)
          foods are expensive, and by leaving any provisions on the
          plate, they
          are throwing away money.</p>
        <p><strong>Socializing</strong></p>
        <p>"Let's talk about it over doughnuts and coffee."</p>
        <p>"We'll go over that at lunch."</p>
        <p>"I'll meet you for dinner."</p>
        <p>"Let's discuss it over a drink."</p>
        <p>"Four Seasons has the greatest margaritas in town; let's go
          over the terms there."</p>
        <p>"I've discovered the best pie shop, let's talk when we get
          there."</p>
        <p>And on and on. It sometimes comes as a great revelation when
          people discover that they can socialize without putting
          something in
          their mouths. Security</p>
        <p>Having the extra weight makes some people feel stronger and
          better able to protect themselves from aggressors.</p>
        <p><strong>Substitution</strong></p>
        <p>Gorging oneself, having that extra helping, choosing that
          extra big cut, is often a substitution for something you want
          and do
          not have. Gluttony is an acceptable vice, easy to satisfy, and
          so the
          normal transferal of one need for another is by way of food.
          It's also
          the only vice that shows. Purposeful Distortion</p>
        <p>Mary Evenson, at a recent Self Mind Control seminar, stood up
          and asked why she could not stop overeating, why she sneaked
          extra
          portions and sometimes ate four and five full meals a day.
          With tears
          in her eyes and a catch in her voice, she said, "People always
          tell me
          not to eat so much. But they never tell me how. How do I
          stop?"</p>
        <p>Looking at the sad woman and sensing the answer she needed
          was
          more than just that of telling her to diet or exercise;she
          already knew
          that. The instructor felt an inspired need to ask her
          point-blank,"Does
          your husband still love you?"</p>
        <p>This seemed to have nothing at all to do with her question
          and
          startled her for a moment. She stood there, leaning on the
          chair in
          front of her, blinking for a long moment, and then tears
          rolled down
          her eyes as she shook her head and said with a sigh,"I don't
          know."</p>
        <p>Actually she hated herself because she disliked the
          reflection
          of that self she saw in the mirror. She knew herself better
          than anyone
          else did. If, knowing herself as well as she did, she hated
          herself,
          how could anyone else not dislike her?</p>
        <p>With a philosophy like that it would be difficult for her to
          believe that anyone could even like, much less love her. She
          believed
          that her husband didn't love her because of the way she
          looked. "Well,"
          she subconsciously thought, "that's all right. I don't love
          the way I
          look either, so why should my husband?" She could cope with
          that.</p>
        <p>But if she were to lose weight, look good, and come to like
          herself again, and her husband still did not love her, then it
          was her
          he didn't love, and not the way she looked. And that she
          couldn't cope
          with.</p>
        <p>No matter how many diets she went on, there was no way that
          her inner consciousness was going to allow her to lose weight
          and look
          good. Looking good was seen as a threat by her inner
          consciousness and
          was to be avoided at any and all costs.</p>
        <p><strong>Need for love</strong></p>
        <p>Did you ever heard words like these when they were a child?</p>
        <p>"Eat everything on your plate, dear. If you want Mommy to
          love
          you, you'd better eat those peas."</p>
        <p>Or spinach, squash, or whatever. Hearing this over a period
          of
          time, the child soon equates food with love. As an adult
          needing love,
          he or she eats because food equals love. If you can't find
          love, find
          food; eat it all up, every bit; isn't that when Mommy loves
          you the
          most?</p>
        <p>Lack of love, moreover, feels like emptiness. Many who want
          to
          fill that emptiness with love fill up with food instead. With
          so many
          reasons for eating and overeating, it's a wonder that everyone
          isn't
          overweight. Why aren't they? As with all things, one's
          viewpoint is
          critical.</p>
        <p>Food represents different things to different people. Do you
          see food as a means of socializing, as a substitute, as a
          method of
          keeping your self-esteem, or as an expression of love? Or do
          you see
          food as energy, pure and simple, like a log on the fire,
          gasoline for
          the car, or electricity for your lights?</p>
        <p>If you're overweight, you can bet that you don't view food as
          energy, and that your problem is covered in one of the above
          groups.
          Many people have gone on ten-day fasts and felt the better for
          it. A
          few people have gone on forty-day fasts.</p>
        <p>Cesar Chavez, the great man who conceived and started the
          Farm
          Workers Union, in 1977 was a student in my seminar. At the
          time he was
          involved with a protest and strike involving Mexican field
          workers. He
          was in the twelfth day of a forty day fast.</p>
        <p>Therefore we must assume that the average, healthy body can
          get along just fine without food for, let's say
          conservatively, five
          days.</p>
        <p>And yet there are people who can eat two eggs, potatoes,
          toast, and coffee at 8:00 A.M., a Danish pastry and coffee at
          10:30
          A.M., and then at 1:00 P.M. say, "I'm starving, let's get a
          bit of
          lunch."</p>
        <p>Obviously, you can't "starve" between breakfast and lunch, so
          what is the reason for the hunger pangs? The answer is
          semantic. The
          empty stomach message you are receiving is only being
          interpreted as
          hunger pangs.</p>
        <p>It's actually potential energy waiting to turn kinetic. This
          feeling of energy has been interpreted as hunger for so long
          that it
          has become an empty stomach feeling, when actually your body
          is telling
          you that it has energy to spare, please put it to some use.
          But instead
          of using it in play, exercise, or work, the energy is used in
          eating
          still more.</p>
        <p>The body has plenty of fuel and is demanding use with the
          message, but instead more fuel is thrown in to the stomach and
          the
          energy turns inward to digest the new onslaught of food that
          the body
          didn't want in the first place.</p>
        <p>Learn to interpret this feeling of hunger as energy. Then use
          the energy. You will soon find that you have more energy than
          before
          you learned to interpret the energy message as a feeling of
          hunger.</p>
        <p>In the beginning of this chapter you read that there was no
          magic to reducing your weight; all you had to do was to eat
          less.
          That's the greatest diet in the world. An even better diet can
          be
          summed up in four words. "Eat less, exercise more." That is
          really all
          there is to it.</p>
        <p><strong>A Simple Method of Eating Less</strong></p>
        <p>Here is one excellent way to eat less. It may pose a problem
          if you have a guilt complex. But that will clear up once the
          pattern of
          eating less is established. Order what you normally do when
          dining at a
          restaurant and serve your usual portions when dining at home,
          but eat
          only half of what's on your plate. Before you begin eating,
          divide the
          portions in half and eat the left half only. It is a simple,
          uncomplicated method of eating less. Eat fruit.</p>
        <p>For more than a hundred years, indeed since the first book on
          diets was written late in the last century, dietitians have
          recommended
          fruit consumption as one meal of the day. By eating an orange
          or two,
          or an apple and a banana, you will find that your hunger
          message
          disappears, and you will still have the energy to put to some
          use.</p>
        <p>A full diet of fruit is not recommended, since we need more
          nutrients than a fruit regimen can provide.</p>
        <p>Once you get used to eating a few pieces of fruit for
          breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you will find many of your eating
          habits
          changing. You do not need a formal diet.</p>
        <p>We do not recommend any of them because all of them tend to
          control you, and since no one enjoys being controlled by an
          outside
          force, you will be subconsciously fighting any diet. Better to
          modify
          your diet; that you can do.</p>
        <p>It is much easier, for example, to eliminate a type of food
          that you believe may be causing you a problem,sugar perhaps.
          Simply
          eliminate sugar and you will be well on the way to recovery.
          You know
          which foods are heavily sugared: cake, cookies, candy, ice
          cream,
          desserts, and so forth.</p>
        <p>You cannot avoid sugar totally; it is in almost all processed
          foods and in most breads. It's not necessary to eliminate it,
          though,
          only modify your intake. You may decide to eliminate bread
          from your
          eating program, or salad dressings, or oil and butter, or
          alcohol. You
          may decide to modify your eating habits by eating moderately
          and
          enjoying it more.</p>
        <p><strong>Immature People Need Instant Gratification</strong></p>
        <p>Attitude has much to do with respect to food. If you see food
          in general as two groups, those being food you want in your
          mouth and
          food you want in your stomach you will find yourself
          considering each
          choice differently.</p>
        <p>Sugared foods, fatty foods, fried foods, you want in your
          mouth but not particularly in your stomach. Grains,
          vegetables, fruit,
          you want in your stomach but not all people care for them in
          their
          mouths.</p>
        <p>The trick is to consider how the food you eat is going to
          affect you an hour after you eat it, a week after you eat it,
          or a
          month after you eat it. Be mature as to your choices. Immature
          people
          need instant gratification, that's mouth food. Mature people
          look to
          the future and consider the consequences of what they put in
          their
          stomachs.</p>
        <p><strong>An Attitude Change</strong></p>
        <p>Gunther Hagen had a problem with both fear and guilt. His
          downfall was apple pie with a large slab of vanilla ice cream
          on top of
          it. The man was overweight and always on one diet or another,
          but he
          could not bring himself to give up the pie and ice cream.</p>
        <p>He sneaked out of the house to the local restaurant and
          crammed the dessert down his throat every day, looking about
          him
          furtively for anyone he knew who might see him here, feeling
          guilty
          about the entire process.</p>
        <p>He was afraid of the consequences of what he was doing, and
          for hours afterward asked himself why he did it.</p>
        <p>Then the longing and inordinate desire overwhelmed him once
          again and he looked for a means to sneak out of the house so
          that he
          could gorge on apple pie and ice cream once again.</p>
        <p>After the seminar he decided that if he was going to eat the
          pie, he was going to enjoy it. One of the keys to satisfaction
          is
          moderation. When you are moderate in the things that you do,
          you are
          generally happy about the outcome.</p>
        <p>So our overweight friend decided that he would be moderate.
          Gunther set a day for himself that would be
          apple-pie-and-ice-cream day
          and on that day he would eat without fear and without guilt.</p>
        <p>He decided that once a week would do it for him. As long as
          he
          knew that on each Tuesday he could have his pie and ice cream,
          he could
          live his life during the rest of the week without the
          incessant craving.</p>
        <p>He programmed himself to that degree at level and it worked.
          When the day came, he enjoyed his pie and ice cream as he
          never had
          before. It was, as he reported, a miracle.</p>
        <p>After four weeks he changed the schedule to monthly
          pie-and-ice-cream days. After three more months, when pie and
          ice cream
          day came around, he didn't feel like any and so did not have
          any. He
          reported to the people at a subsequent seminar that for the
          first time
          in as long as he could remember, he felt truly free and in
          control.</p>
        <p>And yes, he did reduce his weight to where he wanted to be
          and
          has kept to his present size. Without dieting. Simply by
          eating the
          same foods he had always eaten, but in moderation.</p>
        <p>Of course all that extra energy had caused him to think about
          putting it to some use, and so he started taking long walks to
          use the
          energy, and that beneficial side effect helped in his weight
          reduction
          program as well.</p>
        <p><strong>7 Easy Steps to Weigh Less:</strong></p>
        <p>- Accept the fact that you are overweight. Admit it if you
          are.</p>
        <p>- Have a strong desire to rid yourself of weight.</p>
        <p>- Go to the alpha level and see if any of the reasons cited
          in
          this chapter apply to you.</p>
        <p>- Learn to interpret the hunger pangs you feel four or five
          hours after eating as potential energy waiting to turn
          kinetic.</p>
        <p>- Learn the approximate caloric values of the food that you
          eat, and substitute a low-calorie item for a high-calorie one
          whenever
          possible.</p>
        <p>- Eat less, exercise more.</p>
        <p>- Be mature. Consider the consequences of what you eat. Four
          pounds a year doesn't sound like much, but it's forty pounds
          at the end
          of ten years.</p>
