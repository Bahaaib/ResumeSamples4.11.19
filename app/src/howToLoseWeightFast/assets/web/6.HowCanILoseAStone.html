        Can I Lose A Stone In A Month - Rapid Weight Loss With
        Intermittent
        Fasting</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><small><small>By

    <p><big><strong>Rapid Yet Sustained Weight Loss</strong></big></p>
    <big>
      <ul>
        <li><em>1 month, 1 stone, 1 concerted effort</em></li>
      </ul>
    </big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Lets
        figure out what's necessary to achieve this. If we assume 30
        days for a
        month, then we need to lose about 5lbs every 10 days (about 2kg,
        or
        15lb in 3o days, or 0.5lb/day, or over 3lbs per week).</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>I'm
        going to take an imaginary man and woman and put some figures
        down for
        them, showing you how to do it for yourself if you're different
        from my
        examples.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>If
        we assume that there are about 3500 calories in a pound of fat,
        then
        you need to create a deficit of at least 11500 calories each
        week, if
        you want to get those 3lbs off (3500 x 14lbs = 49000cals).</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>If
        we then break that down into each day, that's a daily deficit of
        about
        1600 calories.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Now,
        let's find out how much energy it costs to stay living:</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>I'll
        take 3 men and 3 women.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Male
        1</big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>70kg -11st 0.3lb - 154.3lbs</big></li>
      <li><big>Energy cals (range) 1,918 - 3,036</big></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Male
        2</big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>80kg - 12st 8.4lb - 176.4lbs</big></li>
      <li><big>Energy cals (range) 2,038 - 3,226</big></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Male
        3</big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>90kg - 14st 2.4lb - 198.4lbs</big></li>
      <li><big>Energy cals (range) 2,158 - 3,416</big></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Female
        1</big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>60kg - 9st 6.3lb - 132.3lbs</big></li>
      <li><big>Energy cals (range) 1,598 - 2,531</big></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Female
        2</big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>70kg -11st 0.3lb - 154.3lbs</big></li>
      <li><big>Energy cals (range) - 1,718 - 2,721</big></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Female
        3</big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>80kg - 12st 8.4lb - 176.4lbs</big></li>
      <li><big>Energy cals (range) - 1,838 - 2,911</big></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Notes:
        The ranges shown for daily calorie expenditure are dependant on
        activity level, from sedentary (think office worker that drives
        to work
        and takes no or very limited exercise) to highly active (someone
        who
        has an job that involves several hours of manual labour per day,
        or
        exercises for more than 90 mins at a high intensity/consistently
        high
        heart rate each day).</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>These
        imaginary figures are based upon someone being about 170cm tall,
        in
        their mid 30's, and are used for illustration purposes only, the
        principles behind the practices here are valid, you just need to
        personalise the practices to your situation. These are
        estimations only
        and will vary person to person, to find out more accurately you
        need to
        get your own starting figures. You can do this using the
        calculators
        found at caloriesperhour.com. Use the BMR and RMR calcs for a
        rough
        starting point, then use the practices here to modify the
        figures based
        on real world results.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>So
        you can see that for a woman of 60kg, who is only lightly active
        or
        sedentary, this would basically mean not eating at all, for
        about a
        month!</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Who
        is this for? Thing is though, a 60kg woman doesn't really need
        to lose
        14lbs (about 6kg) or over 10% of her bodyweight, so we're not
        really
        catering for this person. What we should be looking at is the
        higher
        end of the scale. That's where big weight loss numbers are
        really
        practical.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>If,
        for example you look at the 90kg man, even a sedentary
        individual could
        cut over 1000 cals from their daily intake, as long as they do
        it with
        the right foods. I'll come on to that in a moment.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>First,
        let's take a brief look at the 3 factors that will make this
        massive
        calorie reduction possible.</big></p>
    <ol style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>Intermittent Fasting</big></li>
      <li><big>Eating high protein, low fat, low carb.</big></li>
      <li><big>Doing only high intensity weights and very low
          intensity cardio.</big></li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Now
        let's expand each of those so you can create your own plan.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><strong>1:
          Intermittent Fasting</strong></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Intermittent
Fasting
        (the Leangains version) is a simple approach to feeding the
        body. You split the day into two phases, an eating phase and a
        non-eating phase. The eating phase lasts around 8 hours,
        therefore the
        fasting phase lasts about 16 hours. This doesn't mean that you
        eat for
        the whole of the 8 hour block!</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>There
        are two key aspects to IF that make it work in your favour when
        it
        comes to massive weight loss.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><em>1:
          Each day is split, physiologically, into two distinct phases,
          each of
          which help your fat loss goal. These two phases are an
          anabolic, or
          tissue building phase, and a fat burning, or energy breakdown
          phase.</em></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><em>2:
          Using IF makes it much easier to reduce your calories than
          traditional
          dieting.</em></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>I
        don't need to go into more detail about the IF lifestyle,
        because you
        can read the two posts on my website (address at bottom, search
        the
        Intermittent Fasting Category for 'Intermittent Fasting Results
        and
        Guide' and 'Training For Fat Loss') that tell the full story,
        suffice
        to say, if you want to make your weight loss as painless and
        effective
        as possible, you should probably be doing some form of IF.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><strong>2:
          Eating High Protein, Low Fat, Low Carb</strong></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>In
        his superb set of articles about designing a fat loss diet, Lyle
        MacDonald talks about setting things up from the ground, rather
        than
        the top. Say what? Well, what we've done here is start with a
        weight
        loss goal, that being the top or end point, and the worked
        backward to
        figure out what we need to do. In those articles Lyle takes a
        slightly
        different approach and figures out what you need
        physiologically, and
        then puts those figures into a diet, to see what comes out at
        the end.
        Here, we are going to use part of that approach (setting protein
        intake) to give you a starting point for figuring out your
        foods.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><strong>How
          much food do you need? </strong></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Or
        more specifically, how much protein should you be aiming for at
        each
        meal? Well, we can give two answers to that question, the answer
        that's
        best is the one that makes you feel most reassured. The quick
        answer is
        'lots'. The more specific answer is worked out as follows; start
        with a
        level of about 1g/lb of bodyweight and divide over your two or
        three
        meals, and then adjust based on lean tissue and strength drops
        and
        hunger/satiety levels. So if you find your strength dropping,
        and your
        muscle leaving your body, you need to add more protein in, and
        if you
        find yourself getting hungry between meals or not satisfied at a
        meal,
        add more protein!</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><strong>What
Foods
          Can I Eat?</strong></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>I've
        put together a list of foods that will work whilst eating for
        massive
        fat loss. You can download it from my website, via the link at
        the
        bottom. One thing that I consistently find is the total lack of
        hunger
        and feelings of deprivation when on this type of diet, and this
        shouldn't be surprising given the huge range of foods on offer
        here.
        One thing you'll notice is the total lack of liquid foods/meal
        replacement powders/protein drinks. This is deliberate; they
        don't
        provide satiety and satisfaction, and they don't offer much
        opportunity
        for long term diet adherence. As Martin Berkhan says, 'don't
        drink your
        calories'.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><em>Why
          High Protein, Low Fat, Low Carb?</em></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>A
        couple of reasons; 1, you want to keep calories as low as
        possible, as
        easily as possible. 2, protein plus lots of bulky yet low carb
        density
        foods provides the easiest way to feel full, satisfied and happy
        when
        cutting calories.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><strong>3:
          Doing only high intensity weights and very low intensity
          cardio</strong></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Each
        of the three components in this weight loss plan are equally
        important,
        so you'd better find a way of including this part! Just ask
        yourself if
        it's worth jeopardising the whole plan for the sake of missing
        some
        simple exercises?</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><strong>Why
          start with a statement like that?</strong></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Because
        it's too easy for many people to drop back into old ways of
        'exercising
        for weight loss'.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>What
        you NEED to be doing is heavy weights, with low reps and using
        as big
        movements as possible. Remember, big weights are totally
        specific to
        each individual, and the actual number/weight is irrelevant,
        what's
        important is that you lift to YOUR capacity and you learn how to
        fully
        lift at your capacity. For those of you that have hardly lifted
        weights
        before that means learning what a max effort lift feels like,
        AND
        expecting that max to go up quickly as you learn how to get more
        and
        more out of yourself.</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>The
        great thing about this program is that it really is simple. Take
        the
        following exercises and rotate them:</big></p>
    <ol style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <li><big>Squat</big></li>
      <li><big>Dumbell press, bench press or bodyweight dips</big></li>
      <li><big>Dumbell or barbell shoulder press</big></li>
      <li><big>Lat pulldown, pullup, seated row or bent over
          barbell/dumbell row</big></li>
      <li><big>Deadlift.</big></li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Your
        rotation is simple: Do 3 weeks of 5set sof 4-6 reps (5x5 style
        routine)
        and then 3 weeks of 3 sets of 9-12 reps (3x10 style routine).
        Each time
        you hit the upper rep range you increase the weight. Only after
        10-14
        weeks do you need to rest (but if you've already been exercising
        consistently for more than 12 weeks, you need to take a week of
        total
        rest right now - unless you're goal is within 12 weeks from the
        start
        of your program, in which case, you get your rest at the end of
        that!)</big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>If
        you don't know how to do these exercises, you can get
        instruction from
        a competent trainer (you can find if they're any good by
        watching how
        they get you to move and focus on the exercises your learning,
        if they
        get you to do your exercises like those done in instruction
        videos you
        may be sure they know their stuff), or you can check out the
        copious
        amount of vids on YouTube and figure your own way.</big></p>
