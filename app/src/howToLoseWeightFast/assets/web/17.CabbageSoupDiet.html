    <p><font face="Tahoma"><big>When it comes to losing weight there are
          many different diets
          to chose from. In fact, there are often so many choices that
          it can be
          difficult to get started. Yet, by choosing a weight loss
          program and
          sticking with it, you can better guarantee a successful
          outcome.</big></font></p>
    <font face="Tahoma"><big>
        <p>The cabbage soup diet has been around for some time now. Many
          people in fact swear by it as a means to lose weight quickly.</p>
        <p>The cabbage soup diet is designed as a way to help you lose
          weight through the cleansing power of cabbage. You are allowed
          to eat
          fruits, veggies, some meat and one day of rice as well on
          varying days
          of the diet.</p>
        <p>The cabbage soup can be made in varying ways. Try using half
          a
          head of cabbage, some onions, some chicken stock or broth,
          celery, bell
          peppers and a can or two of tomatoes. Add or remove these
          vegetables as
          your taste suits. Also you can add any spices you like to the
          recipe
          for flavour.</p>
        <p>The diet purports to allow you to lose a whopping ten pounds
          in one week! While this may seem unlikely, many people have
          reported
          very good success with this diet.</p>
        <p>The cabbage soup diet is composed of eating the special type
          of cabbage soup described above. Alongside this soup, you are
          also
          allowed to eat some fruits and vegetables, and a little bit of
          rice and
          meat on occasion.</p>
        <p>You are also told to drink at least four glasses of water per
          day. The diet works because of a reduced caloric intake
          alongside the
          benefits that come from eating a low fat, high fibre diet.</p>
        <p>The diet should only be undertaken for seven days at a time.
          It is therefore not designed as a permanent diet option, but
          merely as
          a means to kick start your weight loss.</p>
        <p>Day One: On the first day of the diet you are allowed to eat
          all the fruit you desire excluding bananas as well as your
          cabbage
          soup. You are also allowed unsweetened teas, or water or
          cranberry
          juice.</p>
        <p>Day Two: Day two of the diet involves eating all vegetables
          alongside your cabbage soup. No fruit is allowed on this day,
          but you
          are allowed one baked potato for dinner.</p>
        <p>Day Three: On day three you are able to eat your soup as
          usual, as well as both fruits and vegetables. However, you are
          not
          allowed your baked potato today.</p>
        <p>Day Four: On day four your diet consists of eating just
          bananas and skim milk. You can also still have your soup. Eat
          as many
          as six bananas if you like and drink as much skim milk as you
          want.</p>
        <p>Day Five: Day five of the diet involves eating up to twenty
          ounces of beef and six fresh tomatoes. This day you need to be
          especially on top of drinking all your water in order to get
          rid of the
          uric acid from your body.</p>
        <p>Eat your soup today as well, at least twice. You can also
          substitute broiled chicken (without skin) or fish for the
          beef. You
          cannot however eat two different types of meat. Choose only
          one and eat
          it up to the allotted twenty ounces.</p>
        <p>Day Six: On this day you can eat both meat and vegetables
          alongside your soup. Chose one meat as described above and eat
          lots of
          veggies. When eating veggies however try to avoid those ones
          high in
          starch. This means no potatoes, not yams and probably go easy
          on the
          carrots.</p>
        <p>Day Seven: On day seven you can add brown rice to your diet.
          Eat as much of it as you like and eat your soup as well.</p>
        <p>Day seven is the last day of the diet and you can eat as much
          of the soup and rice as you like. You can also eat vegetables
          and
          unsweetened fruit juices as described above.</p>
        <p>After this week you should see very noticeable results. Most
          people will have lost between 5-7 pounds in the week, though
          many
          people have lost as much as ten pounds in the mere seven days.</p>
        <p>The key to success in this diet is to follow the rules
          exactly
          and drink plenty of water. You can also take a good quality
          multivitamin to ensure that you aren't missing any of the
          nutrients
          your body needs.</p>
        <p>Remember, that though this is a great way to get started with
          your weight loss plan, it is not a diet designed for long term
          use. A
          week is the recommended amount of time and going beyond this
          is not
          suggested.</p>
        <p>Because the diet is only a week however it can make it more
          feasible for those who have trouble sticking to diet and
          weight loss
          plans. Just make sure that after the seven days you keep up a
          healthy
          diet and add regular exercise to your week in order to ensure
          lasting
          results.</p>
