This economy            has hit women, particularly those over 40, especially hard. To ease            some of that burden the president has established a women schlorship            fund for women. Now is a great time to head back to school. This is            one of the best ways you have on ensuring your financial future so            you should take full advantage of it.<br>            <br>            Here are some simple steps to take to find out more about not just            this scholarship program but any other scholarship program you may            be eligible for (don't underestimate the sheer volume of            scholarships available today, virtually anyone can qualify for at            least one scholarship):<br>            <br>            1. To find out more about the Obama Women Schlorship just do a            general search online. Be careful when you go to various websites,            some of them try to trick you into paying a fee for processing or            helping you file your application. Make sure you do your due            diligence and never hand over any money unless you are absolutely            sure they are a legitimate company and that they can really help you            (stay far away from any site that "guarantees" you will be accepted,            they can't).<br>            <br>            Two other great places to find information on scholarships you may            be eligible for are your local public library and the financial aid            office at your local college. The financial aid office is staffed by            people who do this for a living, let them help you out.<br>            <br>            2. Apply for as many scholarships as you can. It is a numbers game            and you won't be approved for every scholarship you apply for. The            more you apply for the greater your chance of getting at least one.<br>            <br>            3. Be very careful when filling out your forms. Make sure you fill            them out completely and provide all the information that they ask            for. It can be time consuming to gather all that information, but            since many scholarships will want pretty much the same things, you            can do it once and then just re-purpose it over and over again.<br>            <br>            4. Don't wait until the last minute. Start early. The earlier you            start the less stressful the whole process will be. You will also            have plenty of time to compile everything they require for the            application and you have time to ask for help if you need it.<br>            <br>            5. Another thing to keep in mind is that there are many scholarships            available that will allow you to take online courses too. This may            be a great help if you are a mom and / or working full time. Being            able to take classes in your own time frame can be the difference            between success and failure.<br>            <br>            It doesn't matter if you apply for the government sponsored women            scholarship program or another type of scholarship for which you are            qualified, the point is that there are many resources to help pay            for part or all of your college education. Now is a great time to            improve your financial future. Go for it!<br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>            <br>          </big></big></big></font>  </body></html>
