          <br>
          <b>Introduction</b><br>
          <br>
          The E degree is a powerful tool.&nbsp; No longer do you have
          to spend your days driving to and from school. You do not have
          to dedicate four or more years to doing nothing but living on
          a campus getting your education.&nbsp; With E degree programs,
          you can easily explore all that the world has to offer with a
          degree in the field of your dreams and get that degree when it
          works for you.<br>
          <br>
          The problem is, though, that the online network of E degree
          programs is huge.&nbsp; Not only are there specific online
          universities and colleges that you can attend, but many of the
          largest schools in the world are now offering E degree
          programs as well.&nbsp; They offer the ability for you to get
          your education from large universities without stepping foot
          on their actual campus.&nbsp; The benefits of this are
          enormous.<br>
          <br>
          Your task, then, is to determine which school is offering you
          the very best opportunity for success.&nbsp; Which school is
          offering you the program that you are most interested
          in?&nbsp; What type of degree can you get from these
          programs?&nbsp; How in the world will you do your educational
          requirements on the internet?<br>
          <br>
          To help you to answer all of these questions, use this e book
          as a guide.&nbsp; You will find helpful tips to finding the
          right schools and to finally getting the degree that you are
          interested in.&nbsp; You will also find the advantages as well
          as the disadvantages of online learning.&nbsp; We will take
          you through the process of getting enrolled and getting your
          life started.<br>
          <br>
          That is the best thing about E degrees.&nbsp; You can take
          back your life and do with it whatever makes you happy.&nbsp;
          This e book is for anyone that wants to get a degree but just
          did not have the time to do it before now. <br>
          <br>
          If life did not allow you to get your degree when you left
          high school, it is for you.&nbsp; If you could not afford to
          attend a standard college, this is for you.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          If you need to continue your education and better your career
          goals, then this is for you as well.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          No matter why you want to enroll in E Degree programs, we will
          help you to make that decision.<br>
          <br>
          One thing to keep in mind throughout this e book is your
          ability to meet the challenges that you are likely to face
          with E Degree programs.&nbsp; The fact is that this is a
          unique method of learning that may not be right for
          everyone.&nbsp; Yet, if you take this degree program seriously
          and strive to complete it as you are directed by the school,
          you will walk away from your computer with an accredited,
          justified degree that really will open doors for you.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Can you do it?&nbsp; Or, should we say, are you ready to do
          it?&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You can finally win at the game of education and the rewards
          are endless.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp; What Is An E Degree?</b><br>
          <br>
          You have likely seen them advertised throughout the web.&nbsp;
          The E Degree is a tool that allows just about anyone that is
          interested to get their degree from online universities. If
          you enroll in an accredited school, which you will learn more
          about later, you will be able to obtain the exact same degree
          as you would get if you attended that school full time or part
          time in the traditional way.<br>
          <br>
          Online learning allows you to do the course work, the homework
          and even the lecturing aspects of the course of study on the
          web or on your computer.&nbsp; There are many formats that you
          can get involved in.&nbsp; Determining the right one for your
          needs is important.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Here are some ways that you will be able to learn in these
          programs.<br>
          <br>
          1. You can attend virtual classrooms set up like message
          boards, forums or blogs and communicate with your classmates
          as well as your instructor.&nbsp; You communicate in this
          manner when you have the time to do so.<br>
          <br>
          2. You can use technology such as web cameras to actually
          watch a traditional class lecture happening.&nbsp; These can
          be done live or in most cases they are taped so that you can
          view them when it works for your needs.&nbsp; In some cases,
          you may be able to communicate in a live classroom with the
          teacher and classmates as the lessons progress from chapter to
          chapter.<br>
          <br>
          3. You can use CD ROM learning programs as well.&nbsp; Here,
          the coursework is self studied, at your own pace.&nbsp; You
          may need to come into the school or visit secure online
          testing facilities to take quizzes or to send in coursework.<br>
          <br>
          4. Email is likely to be one of the methods you use to
          communicate with classmates as well as with your
          instructor.&nbsp; Files including class work can be emailed to
          your instructor.&nbsp; Instant messaging can be used, in some
          cases, to help get your questions answered.<br>
          <br>
          5. Classes may include just online tutorials that will be
          presented as a classroom lecture is.&nbsp; You will listen and
          interact with the online program, learning as you go.<br>
          <br>
          There are countless other ways that schools set up their
          online learning programs.&nbsp; From live communication to
          self study, there are plenty of opportunities for you to find
          the type of learning environment that fits with your specific
          needs.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In many cases, these learning objectives are set in place to
          allow individuals to get the best type of learning program
          based on what the coursework is and the need of that student
          is.<br>
          <br>
          Schools often offer several options for E Degree
          learning.&nbsp; There is not one set method or model that is
          used.&nbsp; When considering the various schools to select
          from, you should insure that the type of learning method that
          you prefer is offered there.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          What Can An E Degree Do?<br>
          <br>
          When the E Degree was first offered, it was done in such a way
          that allowed students to get caught up in their coursework or
          perhaps just get their lectures and classroom visits in from
          home while they still came into the school and took tests, met
          for finals and for discussions, which was a rare
          occasion.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Then came the scams.&nbsp; Yes, there were several various
          online learning companies out there that were nothing more
          than scams.&nbsp; They promised that you could learn whatever
          you needed and wanted to without going to school in the
          traditional method.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The fact is that these schools did allow for you do learn
          online, but they were missing one critical thing.&nbsp; These
          schools were not accredited.&nbsp; While you could learn from
          them, your degree or certificate that you earned was not
          necessarily something that was recognized by employers.&nbsp;
          Therefore, your education may have been solid but you couldn’t
          use it to benefit your life.<br>
          <br>
          Yet, E Degree programs and online learning in general have
          become much more realistic and advanced then this.&nbsp; The
          fact is that, today there are hundreds of schools that are
          offering online degree programs to those that are
          interested.&nbsp; In fact, most schools that offer online
          educational degrees today are accredited.&nbsp; We will talk
          more about why accreditation is important later on.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Once you enroll and obtain an E Degree, you are able to use
          that degree to better your life in any way that you can.<br>
          <br>
          If you get a nursing degree, then you can get a position in
          the field of nursing that you have studied in.<br>
          <br>
          If you get a degree in education, you are ready to be
          certified to become a teacher in the field in which you
          obtained your degree.<br>
          <br>
          If you get a degree in computer programming, you can become a
          computer programmer.<br>
          <br>
          The E Degree allows you to get into a new position or even
          better your current position.&nbsp; In short, it works in the
          same way that any other degree would work for you.&nbsp; The
          only difference here is that you will not be spending
          countless days at the school itself.&nbsp; The school is
          accessed on the internet instead.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Are They Easier?<br>
          <br>
          One thing that you should note is that there is a
          misconception that E Degree learning is easier than that of a
          traditional school.&nbsp; This is untrue.&nbsp; The fact is
          that you will learn the same academic studies that you would
          have learned in a traditional school setting but you will
          learn them online instead of in your local school.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In many ways, the dedication, motivation and the self study
          are much harder to maintain in an E Degree program.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          If you are looking for an easy way to get your degree, the
          online learning community is not necessarily it.&nbsp; For
          example, let’s say that you enroll in a 2 year program to earn
          your nursing degree.&nbsp; You are a mother and have a
          job.&nbsp; You figure that you can easily get in a class here
          and there and end up finishing your degree.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Now, as you are going through your life, you will need to find
          a place for the E Degree within it.&nbsp; After a long day of
          fighting with the kids, you have to make a decision.&nbsp; Do
          I want to stay up for another hour and do my studies or should
          I just go to bed?&nbsp; If you do not have the motivation to
          complete your E Degree, you do not earn anything.&nbsp; You
          have to persevere through each day and each class. <br>
          <br>
          Although the work is no more challenging then you will find in
          your traditional school, you now have to keep your schedule
          and do the work on your own, without a teacher pushing you to
          complete it.&nbsp; You still have that teacher and you may
          still have deadlines to meet, but you do not have a class at
          10 am everyday, necessarily. <br>
          <br>
          The E Degree may be the perfect way for you to get your
          education.&nbsp; Keep reading to learn more about it as well
          as to really answer the question, “Is this for me?”<br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Chapter 2:&nbsp; Why Study Through E Degrees?</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Now that you have a basic understanding of what an E Degree
          is, you may be asking yourself, why should I choose this route
          to getting my degree?<br>
          <br>
          The fact is that there are many reasons and we will take a
          look at the top ones here.&nbsp; When you read through this e
          book, you should spend some time determining just how well E
          Degree learning fits into your life.&nbsp; Does online
          education meet your specific life?&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          These benefits that we are about to share are really only the
          top ones and you may have many more.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the
          bottom line is that there are many benefits to online
          education.<br>
          <br>
          Time<br>
          <br>
          If you ask most people what they would like more of, their
          answer is time.&nbsp; We rush here to there and there is just
          not a whole lot of time for you to spend your days in
          school.&nbsp; In respect to the E Degree, the fact is that you
          can learn while the rest of your life is in full swing.&nbsp;
          Let’s compare.<br>
          <br>
          If you graduate high school and enter a college in your local
          area, you are going to spend probably the next four years
          dedicating your life to your education.&nbsp; Well worth it,
          of course.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Yet, this time for education includes time to drive to and
          from the school, or perhaps you will forgo this all together
          and live on campus, sucking all of your time to put to
          school.&nbsp; You also get not much of a choice in when you
          take your classes.&nbsp; Often students have classes so spread
          out that finding a job to work around them is impossible.<br>
          <br>
          Or, you can use online education.&nbsp; Here, you can live
          your life as you are and get in your coursework when your
          schedule fits it.&nbsp; Some people are naturally night owls
          and work better during the late night hours.&nbsp; Here, you
          can do that.&nbsp; Or, you can take a class at four in the
          afternoon one day and then find that you can sneak another one
          in at eleven in the morning the next time.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          What E Degree programs give you is the option to use your time
          as you need to.&nbsp; You can study faster, complete that
          degree in much less time than a traditional school.&nbsp;
          Likewise, you can take more time if you need to so that you
          can better stay on top of the other aspects in your
          life.&nbsp; Time is one of the most crucial benefits that E
          Degree learning offers you.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          No Travel<br>
          <br>
          Another benefit of E Degree programs is that there is no
          travel involved.&nbsp; You do not have to have transportation
          to and from the school.&nbsp; You do not have to waste your
          time traveling in rush hour traffic to get to your class
          before it starts, again.&nbsp; This is not only an added
          bonus, but for those that have a hard time moving from place
          to place, it is a great way to take full advantage of
          educational opportunities.<br>
          <br>
          If you are handicapped, unable to leave your home or just do
          not drive, then the E Degree may be a great opportunity for
          you to get into the field that is important to you.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In addition, you will find that there are no commuting costs
          either.&nbsp; With the rising cost of fuel, people will
          appreciate this.&nbsp; No gas money is needed, to parking
          tickets for the school’s lots, and no fees for usage.&nbsp;
          You just get to attend school.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, we should mention that in some courses, you will
          need to attend lab learning classes.&nbsp; For example, in a
          nursing degree program, you are still required to get your
          clinical rotation in.&nbsp; To do this, you may need to travel
          to the school, if local to you.&nbsp; Or, you may be able to
          secure these hours through a local business that has a working
          relationship with the school.&nbsp; Most of the time, if these
          opportunities are needed; your school will have the ability to
          provide you with the locations to complete them.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Internet Skills<br>
          <br>
          As you get into the school of your dreams, you may find that
          you are learning more than just what you set out to do.&nbsp;
          One of the benefits that you receive second hand through
          online learning is the ability to use the Internet.&nbsp;
          While some teens of today have absolutely no problem with
          doing anything and everything on the web, some older
          individuals might.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You will learn things like researching, using communication
          technologies like files, various software programs, web
          cameras, and much more.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Why is this important?&nbsp; Not only has it become a very
          important skill to have for life in general, but more and more
          businesses are relying on the internet skills of their
          employees to do their jobs.&nbsp; You are going to find that
          the skills you learn here are ideal to take with you into the
          working environment.<br>

          <br>
          Save Money<br>
          <br>
          We saved this one for now because you will need to do a bit
          more research on your specific school to determine if in fact
          you will save money when getting an E Degree or not.&nbsp; Not
          all schools are the same cost and therefore you need to
          consider this based on the specific school that you decide on.<br>
          <br>
          But, in most cases, you are undoubtedly going to save
          money.&nbsp; The cost for an education on the web runs much
          lower, in most cases, then the state or national colleges and
          universities.&nbsp; The simple cost of enrollment is much
          lower in this method.&nbsp; But, you are likely to save more
          money on tuition anyway.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You will save on travel costs, no fuel costs, no parking fees,
          and no cost for having the car in the first place.<br>
          <br>
          You will save on meals.&nbsp; You will not have to pay top
          dollar for a cup of coffee to keep you awake during class.<br>
          <br>
          You will save on material fees.&nbsp; In most cases, you will
          have software to use rather than large textbooks filled with
          information you probably will not cover.&nbsp; Some courses
          may require textbooks, though.<br>
          <br>
          You do not have to pay room and board.&nbsp; This alone can
          save you thousands of dollars for each year you attend.&nbsp;
          You do not have to rent a dorm room, apartment or other second
          living arrangement to be close enough to the school to attend.<br>
          <br>
          Comparing the costs of an E Degree school and a local
          community college may be a different story.&nbsp; You may have
          to spend a bit of time comparing this yourself, based on the
          location of the school and what it offers.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Yet, it is important to note that some community colleges do
          not provide as many courses to study as the online
          options.&nbsp; You can get a higher degree in some online
          learning schools as compared to some local community college
          degree programs.<br>
          <br>
          Again, these are just some of the many reasons why you may be
          interested in getting an online degree.&nbsp; What are your
          reasons?&nbsp; Take a minute to jot them down.&nbsp; Determine
          if they are met by what E Degree programs can offer.&nbsp; The
          flexibility alone is more inspiring than most realize.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter 3:&nbsp; Who Are E Degrees For, Anyway?</b><br>
          <br>
          You may not realize this, but anyone that is looking for
          education can secure the help of online learning to get
          it.&nbsp; Depending on what type of education you qualify for
          will determine what you are able to apply for.<br>
          <br>
          Just like in any other type of education, you need to have a
          foundation of knowledge to enter into the programs.&nbsp; If
          you live in the United States, you will need to have completed
          high school in order to earn a degree in a university,
          although you may be able to begin earning some credits for
          that degree beforehand.&nbsp; But, there are various programs
          to think about.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Online Learning Before College<br>
          <br>
          One thing you may not realize is that online learning is not
          just for the college level and ready student.&nbsp; Well
          before this time you can be learning through the help of the
          web.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          High School<br>
          <br>
          Those that are in high school can often learn through the
          process of online learning.&nbsp; They can seek out their
          beginning level college courses to get them started in the
          process.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Here, you will want to work with the administration of not
          only the college but also with your high school to determine
          your ability to qualify.&nbsp; You may need to meet specific
          GPA status before being allowed to do this.<br>
          <br>
          Home Schooling<br>
          <br>
          Parents that have children that they are home schooling can
          take advantage of online education as well.&nbsp; There are
          many curriculums that are already computer based, many of
          which will you CD ROMs designed by top educators.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Now, children are able to get online to get the education they
          need.&nbsp; This allows for several key benefits including
          instruction that is in the home but is still taught by a
          certified teacher.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          These programs are offered to children as young as elementary
          school and provide for every level of education.&nbsp; Some
          parents find that enrolling their child into a program like
          this allows them to get the certified education the child
          needs that perhaps the adult can not provide as clearly as
          needed.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Preschool<br>
          <br>
          Yes, even the preschool aged child can get into the process of
          learning on the web.&nbsp; Working with an adult, usually
          their parents, they can tap into the world of online learning
          to learn all sorts of academics in various types of
          environments.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In fact, some children that have done this have shown to go on
          to do even better in a standard school setting down the road.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Learning After College<br>
          <br>
          You have already gone to college or perhaps you never were
          able to go to college in the first place.&nbsp; No matter what
          you did then, you are older know and not too sure if entering
          the college scene is right for you again.&nbsp; If you are
          considering it then it is by all means the ideal choice for
          you.&nbsp; Any person that is looking for an education can
          succeed in getting one now that this type of opportunity is
          available to you.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Never Received College Education<br>
          <br>
          There is no reason why you can not enroll in an online school
          now, no matter what you are doing with your job and
          family.&nbsp; Online education allows you to get the most out
          of life by providing you with the opportunity to become
          educated without having to stop life in its tracks to do so.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Certification<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps you are already out of college and now you need to
          recertify to keep your education up to date to keep your
          current position.&nbsp; Online education and E Degree programs
          are in place to provide that for you.&nbsp; There are plenty
          of schools around the web that offer all sorts of
          recertification programs for those that need them.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Advancing Your Degree<br>
          <br>
          If you currently have a degree but you would like to take it
          to the next level, E Degree programs can help you to do that
          as well.&nbsp; These are designed in such a way as to allow
          you to move to the next level of your education without
          worrying about losing your position at the same time.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          If you are in a current position but would like to further
          your degree to earn a better position down the road, then E
          Degree programs are designed to allow you to do that.<br>
          <br>
          As you will see in later chapters, E Degrees are designed from
          the beginning of educational goals through many levels.&nbsp;
          Sometimes, you will be able to get your Doctorate from an
          accredited online E Degree school.&nbsp; So, advancing your
          career can be done ideally on the web through these
          programs.&nbsp; The best part is that you do not have to stop
          working to make it happen.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Just For Information And Fun<br>
          <br>
          Anyone can enroll in an E Degree program if they are just
          looking for an education.&nbsp; Let’s say that you are retired
          and looking for something to do.&nbsp; Perhaps you would like
          to study history in detail.&nbsp; Or, perhaps you would like
          to learn to do something new such as becoming a writer.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>
          These are things that you can do no matter what age you are or
          what your goals for using this information are.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, there are plenty of individuals that are senior
          citizens going back to school to learn something new or to
          expand their knowledge.&nbsp; The fact is that online E Degree
          programs are ideal for just that use.&nbsp; Educating you
          without you having to stay behind in life is a great tool to
          actually have and to use.<br>
          <br>
          As you can clearly see, E Degree programs and online learning
          is designed for just about anyone out there looking for an
          opportunity to excel with more of an education.<br>
          <br>
          Where You Can Start<br>
          <br>
          When you begin entering the world of online education, you
          will have to follow the same basic guidelines as you would for
          any other school.&nbsp; You will first need to start with a
          goal to obtain a Bachelor degree and move up.&nbsp; The good
          news is that the degrees that are available range
          widely.&nbsp; You can in fact get your doctorate if you are
          interested in doing just that.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          But, before you can do this, you may be required to take
          entrance exams as well as determine where your education
          stands as of now.&nbsp; To get into college level courses, you
          will need to provide information as well as records stating
          that you have a GED or have graduated from high school
          levels.&nbsp; In the cases where you will be able to attend
          prior to completing high school, your school is likely needed
          to sign off onto this.<br>
          <br>
          If you have not been in school in a while, you may also want
          to consider taking some refresher courses to help you get back
          on track.&nbsp; If you are continuing your career education,
          this is not needed in most case.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, what you need to know is that you are not in this
          process alone.&nbsp; You will be working with counselors and
          others that will guide you through finding the right program,
          E Degree and courses to get started with.&nbsp; This is a
          rewarding type of education, not something you are doing alone
          without anyone to guide you.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter 4:&nbsp; Understanding Accreditation</b><br>
          <br>
          One thing that you will hear a lot about is
          accreditation.&nbsp; This term sounds fancy and important, but
          really it is quite simple.&nbsp; The WorldNet Dictionary says
          that accreditation is, <br>
          <br>
          “The act of granting credit or recognition, especially with
          respect to educational institutions that maintains suitable
          standards.”&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          This really does sum up what you need to know.<br>
          <br>
          What does this have to do with you and your E Degree?&nbsp; It
          is quite simple.&nbsp; You need to enroll in a college or
          university that is going to provide you with the highest level
          of education for your money.&nbsp; When you get your degree,
          you should know that you have what it takes to make it in that
          field.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Not only will employers want to insure that your education has
          come from an accredited school, but you need to know how to do
          your job well.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          What Does Accreditation Mean, Then?<br>
          <br>
          What does it take for a school to be accredited?&nbsp; Why is
          this type of school better?&nbsp; An accredited school is one
          that has demonstrated that it is teaching what is required to
          educate students in that field.&nbsp; Schools will need to
          have an outside company come in and observe their
          school.&nbsp; They are looking for the board to decide that
          the school is approved for teaching the highest quality of
          information. <br>
          <br>
          They will find out things like how the school provides
          education, what their resources are like (are they adequate)
          as well as determine if the school provides basic educational
          services that meet the demands and the minimums that are in
          place.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          There are several different ways that a school can be
          accredited.&nbsp; Most of the time, the school will entirely
          be accredited, meaning that all of their courses are
          considered approved.&nbsp; In other cases, just certain
          schools within the college or the university are
          accredited.&nbsp; When you are applying for admission into the
          school, you should insure that it is fully accredited.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          For any school to become accredited, they will need to pay a
          considerable amount of money to do so.&nbsp; In addition, the
          process is not easy nor is it everlasting.&nbsp; The school is
          going to need to be recertified as accredited every several
          years.&nbsp; In addition, the accreditation process can take
          several years to complete.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Why does any of this matter to you?&nbsp; A school that is
          accredited is one that has gone through great lengths to
          insure that you are provided a good education by attending
          there.&nbsp; A school that goes through all of this expense
          and time is a means of showing that the education they provide
          is effective in the field.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Beware Of Non Accredited Schools<br>
          <br>
          We have all seen the ads. <br>
          <br>
          “You can get your bachelors degree in just 30 days!”&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          “You can become an MD in just 6 months and four easy payments
          of just $199 each!”<br>
          <br>
          These are schools that you need to stay away from.&nbsp; Short
          and sweet, just stay away from them.<br>
          <br>
          There is no way that these companies can offer you the full
          fledged education that you will need to get the job or the
          career that you are after.&nbsp; You can even call these
          companies diploma mills because all they are doing is writing
          out some type of diploma and mailing them out after your final
          payment has been mailed.<br>
          <br>
          Sure, they may make it look like you are learning something,
          but their degree is not going to stand up in the real work
          place.&nbsp; Each day, people get taken by these scams and
          unfortunately lose their money.<br>
          <br>
          The sad part is that employers are not dumb.&nbsp; They know
          completely which schools are accredited and which are holding
          your resume down.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Not All Are Bad, Though<br>
          <br>
          It would not be fair for us to say that all schools that do
          not hold accreditation are bad schools.&nbsp; This is in fact
          untrue.&nbsp; There are several reasons for this.&nbsp; For
          example, an accredited school will get their accreditation
          from a private organization.&nbsp; In the United States, many
          of these organizations are not regulated and, therefore, their
          standards may be quite different.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, some schools just do not pursue
          accreditation.&nbsp; In fact, this is very much true of
          schools that have religious affiliations.&nbsp; Here, the
          simple fact that the accreditation process is very costly can
          cause the school to lose a good amount of money.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          On top of these things, it takes several years for a school to
          become accredited.&nbsp; New schools may even have the latest
          advancements in technology, be fully staffed and provide
          cutting edge training and education but not be
          accredited.&nbsp; They could be in the middle of it or may not
          even be pursuing it.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          What To Do As A Student<br>
          <br>
          As a student, then, what are you to do?&nbsp; When it comes to
          finding out if a school is worth the cost, you should take
          into consideration accreditation.&nbsp; But, you should do so
          knowing a few things.<br>
          <br>
          First, realize that accreditation is done for online schools
          just as it is done by those in traditional form.&nbsp; Some of
          the standards may not fit well.&nbsp; Nevertheless, ask
          questions.&nbsp; Find out if the school is accredited and who
          has done the accreditation.&nbsp; The online accreditation
          organization is that of The Distance Education and Training
          Council.&nbsp; Yet, some are being accredited by the standard
          accreditation organizations as well.<br>
          <br>
          In either case, ask these questions.<br>
          <br>
          Is the school entirely or specific schools within it
          accredited?<br>
          <br>
          If not, is the school in the process of getting their
          accreditation at this point?<br>
          <br>
          If not, why not?<br>
          <br>
          If the school is accredited, take a few minutes to verify
          which organization accredited the school.<br>
          <br>
          Is this organization legitimate?&nbsp; You can find this
          information rather easily on the web just by looking at the
          Better Business Bureau or doing a search.<br>
          <br>
          If the school is not accredited or in the process of getting
          it, find out if they were turned down.&nbsp; If so, find out
          why?<br>
          <br>
          Why go through this trouble?&nbsp; It is quite simple.&nbsp;
          Your degree, your education and your funding is going towards
          that E Degree.&nbsp; You deserve to make the best decision
          possible and you can only do this with all the information in
          hand.<br>
          <br>
          Taking accreditation seriously is important.&nbsp; Getting
          these answers is essential.&nbsp; With so many bad apples on
          the web looking to take your money, you do need to know what
          you are investing in as well as what it will get you.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, the bottom line is that you should take into
          consideration this fact.<br>
          <br>
          If it is too good to be true, it probably is.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Before you begin learning, learn about your school’s ability
          to provide for you.<br>

          <b>Chapter 5:&nbsp; What You Can Expect </b><br>
          <br>
          Now that you know a bit about E Degrees, you will next want to
          know what you can expect from it.&nbsp; Let’s skip over
          finding the right school for now as you should still be trying
          to decide if the online learning experience is right for
          you.&nbsp; Don’t worry, we will do that next.<br>
          <br>
          Here is where you are.&nbsp; You are enrolled in the perfect
          online school getting ready to earn your E Degree.&nbsp; What
          is school going to be like?&nbsp; What are your classes going
          to be like?&nbsp; How will you communicate with your teacher?<br>
          <br>
          You probably have a lot of questions and on top of that, each
          school is going to be a bit different then the next one.&nbsp;
          But, here are some of the basics of what you will see when it
          comes to E Degree learning.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Communication<br>
          <br>
          Communication is vital in the world of education.&nbsp; You
          have to be able to talk to your teachers, ask questions and
          get the information that you need.&nbsp; Some schools have
          their own software programs in place to allow this to
          happen.&nbsp; Others will use various other systems based on
          what needs they have.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Some commercial software packages that are quite common are
          those such as WebCT as well as Blackboard.&nbsp; Your school
          is likely to have these software programs in place and will
          give you the details of it.&nbsp; Some are completely designed
          software packages.&nbsp; Others are just simply websites that
          have message boards on them.<br>
          <br>
          When it comes to using these programs, they are a bit
          different than you would think.&nbsp; If you went to class in
          a traditional setting at your local college, you would come to
          class at the same times as other students as well as the
          teacher.&nbsp; But, this is not what happens in the
          traditional E Degree program.&nbsp; Here, you will use an
          asynchronously systems.&nbsp; That means that students as well
          as your teachers will meet at different times.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Let’s say that you have to work 9 to 5 each day.&nbsp; Your
          perfect time for a class is at 7pm, when everyone is settled
          and you have some time to yourself.&nbsp; No matter what time
          you plan to do your coursework, you can log into the software
          program or even the website, if that is the method in which it
          is designed and simply do what needs to be done.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In this system, students as well as teachers will meet at
          different times.&nbsp; The lectures and the coursework is
          completed when it is convenient for you to do so.&nbsp; You
          will participate in the study at different times than your
          classmates.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          How It Works<br>
          <br>
          In a typical class at one of the better E Degree schools, you
          will simply start your week with an email from your teacher or
          instructor.&nbsp; The instructor will tell you what the week’s
          topics for discussion and learning will be as well as send out
          the assignments that you will need to complete.&nbsp; The
          instructor is also likely to provide you with information in
          the form of a short lecture.&nbsp; He will also add topics for
          your classmates and you to talk about.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You will go through the week doing your assigned work.&nbsp;
          It can be anything from reading the lectures to providing
          papers and even meet for conference system participation
          calls.&nbsp; You can read other student’s questions as well as
          ask your own.&nbsp; You will participate in discussions,
          usually done in forum style so that students can post when it
          is convenient for them to do so.&nbsp; And, you will send in
          your work to your instructor through email.&nbsp; He sends it
          back, graded.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          But, Technology Is Not Left Behind<br>
          <br>
          Many of the more advanced E Degree schools do not leave your
          education to just emails and software.&nbsp; Today, many of
          them incorporate much more technologically advanced
          systems.&nbsp; Yes, this is a bit of fun and it allows you to
          communicate with your teacher and students in a more direct
          way.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          If you enjoy the ability to hold class discussions or are a
          learner that does better with hearing and seeing rather than
          just reading, these are technological advancements that you
          will want to look for in the school that you select.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Chats.&nbsp; If you have ever been in a chat room, then you
          know what we are talking about.&nbsp; Some schools or courses
          will schedule chats to keep the class working together.&nbsp;
          By doing this, your instructor can bring the entire class
          together to talk about the various topics set forth.&nbsp;
          These may be mandatory or simply additional methods of
          communicating.<br>
          <br>
          Online Video.&nbsp; Today, you see the news on your laptop in
          streaming video.&nbsp; Many of the best online schools are now
          providing this type of video for their educational
          abilities.&nbsp; Simply, you can sit down with your cup of
          coffee and watch a lecture unfold in front of your eyes.&nbsp;
          These classes are ideal for those courses that are just too
          detailed to provide through written lectures.<br>
          <br>
          Video Conferencing.&nbsp; Some of the most technologically
          advanced schools may provide for this service as well.&nbsp;
          All you do is sit down, coursework in front of you and listen
          and watch the live lecture.&nbsp; With this type of software,
          you can raise your hand to discuss with the teacher, answer
          questions and even ask them.&nbsp; All of this is done in real
          time.<br>
          <br>
          As you can see, there are many fun and interesting ways that
          you will be able to enjoy your education when it comes to E
          Degrees.&nbsp; The fact is that not all schools are the same
          though.&nbsp; If you see something here that really makes you
          smile, make sure that you look for it in the school that you
          attend.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In addition, realize that each course will likely have their
          own methods of educating you.&nbsp; Some courses need more
          hands on attention then others do.&nbsp; Some courses may be
          simple self studies where others rely heavily on
          lectures.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In any case, now you have had a look at what the normal
          practice is likely to be for your E Degree.&nbsp; Let’s help
          you to find the best school for you to get into now.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Chapter 6:&nbsp; Selecting the Right</b> <br>
          <br>
          E Degree School<br>
          <br>
          We have talked about the methods of accreditation and how it
          is essential for you to find a school that is
          accredited.&nbsp; Yet, there is much more to your school then
          just that.&nbsp; You will need to put together your own plans
          for attending as well as find the school that offers what you
          are looking for.<br>
          <br>
          In later chapters, we will help you to understand what some of
          the various degrees are that you can obtain through E Degree
          programs.&nbsp; First, though, let’s figure out what the
          school has to have for you to enroll there.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Selecting Schools<br>
          <br>
          Besides accreditation, you will want to take other things into
          consideration before selecting the right online educational
          organization for your specific needs.&nbsp; No school is worth
          your time or your money if they can not provide the type of
          education that you are looking for.&nbsp; This means
          determining if they offer the programs that you are interested
          in first.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Picture in front of you a large clipboard, full of all of the
          E Degree school options that you have.&nbsp; Each school is
          listed there, and a space for you to take notes.&nbsp; As you
          go through the next sections, you will be figuratively
          crossing off the schools that do not apply to your
          needs.&nbsp; Your goal is to narrow down the field so that you
          can find the select few schools that offer the very best
          educational opportunity for your needs.<br>
          <br>
          Programs Offered<br>
          <br>
          Your first goal will be to determine if they offer the courses
          that you are interested it.&nbsp; Simply, if they do not have
          what you are looking for, then they can not provide your
          education to you.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Here are some questions to answer in that regard.<br>
          <br>
          Does the school offer the entry level program that I am
          interested it?&nbsp; They will need to do this or, you will
          not find any benefit going to that school.<br>
          <br>
          Does the school offer you the ability to advance in this
          career path with their school?&nbsp; If you can only take
          entry level courses at that school, you will need to advance,
          then, to more advanced schools to finish your degree.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          What length of study can you obtain at that school for your
          degree?&nbsp; Some schools are now offering well beyond the
          Associates degree and even the Bachelor’s degree.&nbsp; You
          can, in some fields of study and in some schools, advance to
          Doctorate levels of education through the E Degree programs.<br>
          <br>
          Does the school offer me the specialized area that I want to
          study?&nbsp; For example, if you find a school that offers
          nursing degrees but you would like to obtain a degree that is
          in forensic nursing, if this is not offered, specifically, you
          may not meet the requirements to be certified as such.<br>
          <br>
          Now, these are just the first things to take into
          consideration.&nbsp; If you visit the website of any online E
          Degree school, the first thing you need to know is if that
          school offers what you are looking for.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          When it comes to looking for long term educational
          opportunities, this can pay off for you.&nbsp; It is faster,
          easier and just more economical to stay with the same school,
          if possible throughout your educational career.&nbsp; This may
          not be possible in some fields of study, though.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          What’s Involved<br>
          <br>
          Next, you need to determine what each of those schools will
          offer during the courses.&nbsp; Again, here are some of the
          questions that you will want to answer for yourself to
          determine how well the school fits these needs that you have
          in place.<br>
          <br>
          How long does the course take to complete for you to earn your
          degree?&nbsp; While every degree program is different based on
          the amount of knowledge that you need to have and practice you
          need to obtain, believe it or not there are differences
          here.&nbsp; Determine what the average length of attendance is
          for your specific degree goals.<br>
          <br>
          What types of courses are offered from that study?&nbsp; If
          you are looking to specialize, you will want to make sure that
          your field of study is provided there.&nbsp; In addition, you
          will find differences in some subject from one school to the
          next.&nbsp; Finding the amount of coursework in your
          educational background is going to be necessary.<br>
          <br>
          How are classes taken in that degree field as well as that
          school?&nbsp; As we mentioned before, there are plenty of
          various types of methods for taking classes.&nbsp; Some
          schools offer less flexibility here and others offer
          more.&nbsp; Determine how you will attend your glasses to get
          your education.<br>
          <br>
          What’s The School’s Reputation?<br>
          <br>
          Beyond that of accreditation, your school has set forth a
          reputation that is likely to tell you what you can expect from
          that school if you attend.&nbsp; There are many things that
          play a role in this but, you will want to determine what it is
          that you can expect from your school nevertheless.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          As you sit there, you probably have an opinion about the best
          schools in the country now that are traditionally based.&nbsp;
          Perhaps you think that Yale is the best school or you may even
          think that perhaps Harvard is.&nbsp; The reputation that
          school has is important.&nbsp; The same is true about the
          online educational community.<br>
          <br>
          Again, here are some additional questions to ask of your
          school to help check off the schools that are not right for
          you.<br>
          <br>
          What do you know of that school?&nbsp; Many people have heard
          good and bad about the school.&nbsp; Sometimes it is important
          to take note of these things.&nbsp; This can be especially
          helpful in cases where you know of someone that has been
          educated at that school.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          This first hand knowledge can be very important to your
          opinion of the school as well as what the school has provided
          in the past.<br>
          <br>
          What can you learn about that school?&nbsp; Just like any
          other purchase you make, doing some background work can be
          quite helpful.&nbsp; Here, you will want to look for reviews
          of the school online offered by other students.&nbsp; Avoid
          trying to obtain these reviews directly from the school’s site
          as these are obviously biased.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Instead, work on providing yourself with necessary information
          by looking for information from others that have
          attended.&nbsp; If you ask, they are likely to provide just
          what you are looking for.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          What do professional organizations have to say about the
          school?&nbsp; There are plenty of professional college level
          commissions that usually do have something to say about
          it.&nbsp; In addition, you can learn about the school through
          checking them out on the Better Business Bureau’s website.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Learn About Their Success<br>
          <br>
          When you attend an online school to earn an E Degree, your
          goal is to walk way from the degree with success, of some
          sort.&nbsp; One of the benchmarks for a school is how well
          they provide this education.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Now, as a new student it is hard to know what your education
          will be like.&nbsp; You won’t know what is provided for and
          what is not.&nbsp; Instead, what you will need to do is to
          learn as much as you can from those that have passed through
          those virtual doors.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          One way to do this is to learn from those that left.&nbsp; You
          are not likely going to be able to pull up their names and
          numbers and give them a call though.&nbsp; Yet, you can learn
          from them in several other, key ways.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Here are yet another set of questions that you can ask of the
          school to determine if it is the right one for you.<br>
          <br>
          How many students are enrolled per year and of them, how many
          graduate on time?&nbsp; This information can be obtained right
          from the E Degree school.&nbsp; In most cases, you will find
          this information to be posted right on their website.&nbsp;
          Asking this question is vital as it can provide you with an
          idea of what is likely to happen to you.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Will it take you just six months as the school claims?&nbsp;
          Or, do most of its graduates extend that to 12 months
          instead?&nbsp; If this information is not readily available,
          simply ask for it.<br>
          <br>
          What do graduates accomplish when they leave the school?&nbsp;
          This too is another question you want to know.&nbsp; Are the
          graduates from the school successful?&nbsp; Do they find
          employment right away?&nbsp; In addition, where are they now,
          several years after they have graduated?<br>
          <br>
          This information can serve to guide your decision simply
          because it is the likely path you will take.&nbsp; If many of
          the school’s graduates go on to solid positions and five years
          later are earning six figures, you know their education paid
          off.&nbsp; Again, to get this information, request it from the
          school.&nbsp; You probably can find it right on their website
          as well.<br>
          <br>
          What is their graduate’s pass rate for exams and licensing
          procedures?&nbsp; Here, you want to know the facts.&nbsp; How
          many students leave their nursing, medical, law or other
          degree programs, take their licensing tests and pass the first
          time?&nbsp; Most universities collect this information and can
          provide it to you. <br>
          <br>
          This information is especially important for the type of
          education you are looking into.&nbsp; Sure, their law program
          has graduates passing the bar well but what about getting a
          nursing license?&nbsp; You should know what the likelihood of
          you securing that information actually is.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          What Services Does The School Provide?<br>
          <br>
          Your list is probably pretty well down to just a few schools
          by now.&nbsp; As you go through the process of finding the
          right school, you should also pay attention to what that
          school will provide to you in the way of various
          services.&nbsp; Just like any school, you need to know what to
          expect in this regard.<br>
          <br>
          Here are some questions to ask your school about the services
          that they provide to their students.<br>
          <br>
          Does the E Degree school provide for extra help in the way of
          tutoring?&nbsp; If you were in a traditional school, you may
          need to work with a tutor when things got a bit rough.&nbsp;
          How does your E Degree school provide this additional help if
          it is needed?&nbsp; Most importantly, how does this process
          work for you?<br>
          <br>
          Does the E Degree school provide for access to the teacher or
          instructor should you need it?&nbsp; What happens if you just
          do not understand something?&nbsp; How will you communicate
          with your teacher one on one?&nbsp; If you are unable to
          convey your problems through email, how does the school, or
          the teacher, handle these problems for and with you?&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You should be able to easily reach your instructor for help as
          well as one on one time with them.&nbsp; Of course, this may
          differ from one teacher to the next, though.<br>
          <br>
          What about financial aid?&nbsp; Most of those that are
          attending college today need some help with financial
          aid.&nbsp; From scholarships to funding and even to financing
          your education, you may need this help.&nbsp; Does the school
          offer it as well as do you qualified for any of the programs
          that it offers?<br>
          <br>
          You will find that most of the E Degree schools do provide for
          some level of education in this means.&nbsp; You may need to
          insure that the programs are programs that you do personally
          qualify for.&nbsp; In addition, some offer scholarship
          programs to those students that meet requirements, just like a
          traditional school would do.<br>
          <br>
          Of course, there is much more that you will need to take into
          consideration when it comes to earning your E Degree.&nbsp; In
          fact, you are bound to spend countless days considering the
          right school.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          If you were enrolling in a standard, traditional college,
          wouldn’t you give it all of this attention as well?<br>
          <br>
          While many people do not like to take the time to research,
          asking and getting answers to all of those aspects listed here
          really can make sure that you get the best education available
          for your dollar.&nbsp; In many, many ways, success is right
          around the corner, if you find the right school to accomplish
          it in.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter 7:&nbsp; Program Choices</b><br>
          <br>
          Everything sounds great.&nbsp; You have found all sorts of
          information on the various schools.&nbsp; Now, just which
          program do you plan to enroll in?&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          While it can be hard to make up your career choice no matter
          what type of school you plan to attend, you will want to do
          your best to take into consideration all of the aspects that
          are important to you.&nbsp; To help you in picking the right
          career path for your needs, take the time to read through the
          descriptions of the degree programs offered by the E Degree
          school you plan to attend.&nbsp; <br>

          you.&nbsp; But, to give you some idea of what career choices

          <b>Chapter 8:&nbsp; Enrolling, the Process</b><br>
          <br>
          You have finally found your school.&nbsp; You have found the
          perfect program to enroll in.&nbsp; You are about to start on
          your E Degree career.&nbsp; So, what are you waiting for?<br>
          <br>
          The enrollment process for E Degree schools is not much unlike
          enrolling in another other type of school.&nbsp; You will
          first need to put in an application to that school.&nbsp; In
          some schools, especially those that are parts of traditional
          universities and colleges (even schools like Harvard and
          Standard offer E Degree programs.)&nbsp;&nbsp; The application
          process will take just a few minutes, sometimes done right
          online.<br>
          <br>
          E Degree schools will then ensure that you are qualified to
          attend their school.&nbsp; If you are enrolling in a Master
          degree program, they want to insure that you have the
          undergraduate and Bachelor degree requirements as well.&nbsp;
          In some cases, you will need to insure that these credits can
          be moved from one school to the other.<br>
          <br>
          Requesting Information<br>
          <br>
          One thing that you will need to do is to request detailed
          information about the courses and the E Degree that you plan
          to earn.&nbsp; Since it is important for you to understand how
          the courses work, you will need to learn in detail about
          them.&nbsp; The good news is that you can find all of this
          information available to you right here on the web.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Most of the online E Degree schools will require you to either
          fill out an online request form or contact them to request
          it.&nbsp; They will then send you packages in the mail will
          all of the details that you are going to need.&nbsp; What’s
          more is that they will have a guidance counselor call you to
          begin talking to you about your needs, desires and
          goals.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          From this point, you will need to complete your application
          and submit it.&nbsp; Once it is fully reviewed and you are
          accepted into the school, you will learn when your classes
          will start, how they will work, as well as what your goals
          will be.&nbsp; Of course, you will need to make payment before
          the learning process begins as well.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          What You’ll Need<br>
          <br>
          As a child, you probably got a list of supplies that you would
          need for school before school started for the year.&nbsp; When
          it comes to the E Degree, it is still important to pack your
          bags for your education.&nbsp; But, what you will need is much
          different now then it was with the traditional school<br>
          <br>
          Here are a few things to keep in mind.<br>
          <br>
          Your computer.&nbsp; It is essential to have a good, working
          computer that you can rely on.&nbsp; You should insure that it
          offers spam protection and virus protection (and that it is
          running) so that you can insure there is no reason you can not
          get online to work on your degree.<br>
          <br>
          Internet access.&nbsp; Beyond just having the internet to use,
          you should try to have high speed internet access or an
          effective high speed modem.&nbsp; You are likely to be
          watching video streams, uploading and sending emails and files
          and you will need to be able to do all of this without a
          problem.&nbsp; Take into consideration having high speed if
          possible.<br>
          <br>
          Textbooks.&nbsp; In some courses you will need to purchase or
          rent textbooks for your degree study.&nbsp; This will be
          dependant on the school and most importantly the type of
          course you are taking.&nbsp; It is essential to have the right
          tools in hand.&nbsp; Some schools will not require this
          material, but most will.<br>
          <br>
          Software.&nbsp; You may need to purchase additional software
          for your computer.&nbsp; In some cases, this software is part
          of the cost of paying for your education through the E Degree
          school.&nbsp; In most cases, you will need to have specific
          software in order to watch the lectures, to attend virtual
          classes as well as to communicate with others.<br>
          <br>
          Other materials.&nbsp; Like in traditional settings, you will
          need to have your standard paper and pen.&nbsp; You should try
          to have a headset that will help you to hear the video streams
          without clogging up everyone else’s need for quiet.&nbsp; Your
          E Degree teachers will help you to know what else you need to
          have to get started.<br>
          <br>
          A Quiet Place.&nbsp; One of the most important aspects is to
          have a quiet place to work.&nbsp; You are going to need a
          place to work on your projects, write papers and to stay
          focuses.&nbsp; Of course, your computer needs to be in those
          locations as well.<br>
          Chapter 9:&nbsp; The Cost<br>
          <br>
          Going to college is very expensive.&nbsp; It does not matter
          what, where or how you go, it will cost you.&nbsp; But, when
          you consider the fact that your education will likely improve
          and you will end up in a good paying job, this helps to make
          the cost of school a better realization.<br>
          <br>
          When it comes to getting an E Degree, you are likely to pay a
          decent amount of money.&nbsp; As discussed earlier, the costs
          for going to an online school are generally less then
          attending a school full time.&nbsp; But, do not take our word
          for it.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You should invest in determining which school offers the most
          bang for the buck.&nbsp; BUT!&nbsp; We can not emphasize
          enough that your education is much, much more important than
          your cost.&nbsp; Choosing a cheaper school that offers the
          same qualifications, same educational experience is not a bad
          thing.&nbsp; Choosing a school solely because it is less
          expensive can cause you to be wasting your money.<br>
          <br>
          Financial Aid<br>
          <br>
          Another thing to keep in mind is financial aid.&nbsp; Most
          schools today offer some help to the student that is looking
          to attend a college or university.&nbsp; This holds true for
          the E Degrees as well.&nbsp; No matter where you are in the
          world, what your goals are, there is likely to be
          opportunities to find financial aid for your education.<br>
          <br>
          Some E Degree schools offer help to those that just can not
          afford it as well.&nbsp; You may qualify for reduced
          educational programs.&nbsp; While we would not recommend
          choosing a college because it offers this, it is still a
          method to getting your education that you may be interested in<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Other Funding<br>
          <br>
          In addition to financial aid, do not forget about the
          scholarship programs that abound.&nbsp; Yes, even E Degree
          learners can find countless opportunities to save when working
          with these schools.&nbsp; The schools themselves often offer
          opportunities for those that need them.&nbsp; Scholarships
          often can be used for funding your education from various
          other organizations as well.<br>
          <br>
          Government grants and programs are beginning to allow for E
          Degree learning as well.&nbsp; If you think you may qualify,
          check out the US Government’s Department of Education website
          at www.ed.gov to learn more about these programs.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter 10:&nbsp; The Challenges</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Let’s be honest here.&nbsp; Earning an E Degree is not
          something that everyone needs or should do.&nbsp; The fact is
          that the experience of the college atmosphere is something
          that can not be duplicated in that of the standard E Degree
          program.&nbsp; And, while we believe the E learning is a
          wonderful way to learn, we have to point out the simple facts
          that there are some people it may not be right for.<br>
          <br>
          Your Own Learning<br>
          <br>
          When it comes to your education, you are your own best and
          worst enemy.&nbsp; One of the most essential problems that
          those that are involved with E Degree programs will have is
          keeping themselves on track.&nbsp; It is very easy to push off
          you work for another day or for you to do later.&nbsp; Those
          that are no good at managing their time can easily find
          themselves behind the game.&nbsp; This can be very costly to
          someone that is looking to actually make something of their
          degree.<br>
          <br>
          To state this simple, you will gain quite a bit of freedom and
          flexibility when it comes to obtaining your degree
          online.&nbsp; At the same time, you will find that this
          freedom can be the worst part of the entire learning
          experience as well.<br>
          <br>
          To remedy this problem, it is essential that you keep yourself
          motivated to excel.&nbsp; Know what your goals are, post them
          near your computer and reflect on them daily.&nbsp; Realize
          that your first dedication needs to be to your education
          simply because your future depends on it.<br>
          <br>
          If you find that you are not a person that can manage time
          wisely or you are someone that needs more structure in place,
          E Degree programs may not be right for you.<br>
          <br>
          It Broke<br>
          <br>
          While the dog can not eat your homework, the internet
          can.&nbsp; With this type of learning you are dependant on
          your computer and your internet connection.&nbsp; When and if
          it fails, you are sure to find yourself struggling to get your
          course work completed.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          To solve this problem, you may want to take into consideration
          a back up plan.&nbsp; Perhaps you will use your desktop
          computer for your coursework but just in case something does
          happen, you can rely on your laptop or another computer at a
          friend’s home.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to this, you need to realize that you may need to
          hone your computer skills to be successful as well.&nbsp; You
          will need to stop and insure that you know how to use the
          necessary software programs.&nbsp; If you are not good at
          typing, then it may be beneficial to take a quick course to
          improve this.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          It’s Not For Me<br>
          <br>
          Another problem that you may face is having to actually deal
          with a computer monitor instead of a face.&nbsp; Some people
          do not do well without the personal interaction of a teacher
          and other students.&nbsp; Some students are wired to not be
          able to do well without having things like eye contact and
          personal interaction.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In addition to this, you may need to learn just how to
          communicate more effectively through the web.&nbsp; You will
          need to be able to type out your feelings, concerns,
          discussions and thoughts rather than saying them.&nbsp; Not
          everyone is capable of doing this right off the bat.&nbsp;
          But, there are plenty of individuals that can learn it
          successfully.<br>
          <br>
          As we have said throughout this e-book, you need to start off
          by making sure that E Degree learning is the right type of
          learning for your needs.&nbsp; There are bond to be issues
          that come up.&nbsp; You may not like it.&nbsp; Or, you may
          just not have the time that you thought you had to dedicate to
          getting your degree.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          In any case, your goals should be to focus on finding the
          right type of degree program for your specific talents and
          abilities.&nbsp; Believe it or not, the E Degree does work
          well for many people.&nbsp; Only you can decide, though, if
          you are one of those people.<br>

          If you have made it this far, then you get a
          congratulations.&nbsp; You are well on your way to becoming
          successful with your E Degree program.&nbsp; Although there
          seems to be a lot work that goes into the process, you may
          find that it is not all that hard after all.&nbsp;
          Nevertheless, we do have some tips for you to take into
          consideration.<br>
          <br>
          1. Determine first if E Degree programs are for you.&nbsp;
          Spend some time really researching the good and the bad and
          see how well you fit within those goals.<br>
          <br>
          2. Never settle for something that is not what you want.&nbsp;
          If the E Degree school you are considering does not offer
          exactly the program that you are looking for, or you did not
          see it listed here, do not worry, it is probably out
          there.&nbsp; Make sure you do not settle for the wrong program
          as you really do not get any benefit from this.<br>
          <br>
          3. Do your homework to learn as much as you can about the
          school you plan to attend.&nbsp; Not only will this save you
          time from making a mistake but it will allow you to find the
          school that you fit well into.&nbsp; With so many out there,
          you should commit to some time to do this successfully.<br>
          <br>
          4. Dedicate a space and time for learning.&nbsp; Just because
          you have all the flexibility in the world with your education
          does not mean that you should not plan ahead.&nbsp; The fact
          is that you need to insure that your education comes
          first.&nbsp; In that, you need to plan a schedule each week to
          include time for your lectures and your homework.&nbsp; This
          really will make or break how well you do.<br>
          <br>
          5. Consider E Degree programs for continuing education.&nbsp;
          If you are looking for a good way to continue your education
          or to keep your licensing requirements, E Degree programs are
          ideal for doing just that.&nbsp; They can provide you with an
          ideal means for finding the educational goals you need without
          stopping life in its tracks.<br>
          <br>
          6. Don’t fall for gimmicks.&nbsp; As with any other type of
          educational opportunity, you will need to insure that you know
          who the school is, what you are doing and do not fall for
          ploys in advertising.&nbsp; You want to insure that you have
          all that it takes to succeed, not the best price or best ad in
          town.<br>
          <br>
          7. Plan to succeed.&nbsp; Give yourself every opportunity to
          get ahead.&nbsp; If taking your education to the next level is
          important to you, then make it happen.&nbsp; Do not stop in
          your tracks because it gets too challenging or too
          boring.&nbsp; Find ways to make it all come to life.<br>
          <br>
          8. Communicate with your classmates and teacher.&nbsp; Many of
          the newest technologies allow you to do just that.&nbsp; Take
          full advantage of the opportunity to get all the interaction
          you need.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Conclusion</b><br>
          <br>
          You have made it.&nbsp; Now, the question comes at you.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>
          Are E Degree programs right for you?<br>
          <br>
          Again, only you can make the decision on this.&nbsp; You will
          find countless reasons why you should not do it.&nbsp; You
          don’t have time.&nbsp; You can’t afford it.&nbsp; You just do
          not know what you want to do with yourself.&nbsp; Sure, these
          excuses may hold you back, but consider what an E Degree can
          do for you too.<br>

          have.<br>
          <br>
          It can improve your self esteem.<br>
          <br>

          believe them, it is likely that more learning will happen
          through the web each year.&nbsp; Soon, students will not even

          it.&nbsp; <br>
