          </b><b> Introduction</b><br>
          <br>
          I have been a student at a private college and I currently
          work for another private college.<br>
          <br>
          When I worked in the financial aid department of one career
          based college I would sit down face to face with potential
          students and their families.<br>
          <br>
          I have seen first hand, time and time again, while a private
          college education can cost tens of thousands of dollars,
          anyone with a little ingenuity and a lot of self motivation
          and confidence can get their college education at a
          drastically reduced price and in many cases even for free.<br>
          <br>
          Almost all of the students and parents I have sat down with to
          explain the options available are not aware of what is
          available for them to use to further their college education.<br>
          <br>
          Some things we tell students about is standard information
          that everyone receives when they speak to financial aid
          counselors. A chosen few, usually based on their needs are
          informed about a few other closely guarded secrets.<br>
          <br>
          You can now learn those secrets as you read this report, Free
          College.<br>
          <br>
          This book is dedicated to all current and future college
          students young and old who would like to get their college
          education for little or no cost. <br>

          Enjoy!<br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b> Chapter One: The First Twelve Years</b><br>
          <br>
          Free education is a luxury all to often taken for granted by
          children as well as young adults barely coming to the end of
          their senior year of high school. Yes, high school graduation
          is a time when the realization of the fact that they’re about
          to be catapulted into the “real world” a place that creates
          fear and trepidation of the unknown, a time when the value of
          all those years of free education suddenly comes crashing down
          like an icy cascade of water that jolts a person from a deep
          sleep. It is when the knowledge of how they utilized or didn’t
          utilize their free gift will be put to practical use. It is
          also a time that finally puts a real dollar amount on
          education; yes after high school many have the rude awakening
          that from that point on education is anything but free. <br>
          <br>
          Most often when a person, especially one right out of high
          school is sitting in front of a financial aid officer at any
          college the reaction is the same. Facial expressions of shock
          and disbelief and sometimes even anger are the normal fare for
          the poor officers who often have to take a “Don’t kill the
          messenger” approach to the shocking news that there is no such
          thing as a free education. <br>
          <br>
          Financial Aid is just that, aid or help in the forms of
          grants, scholarships, loans, and other programs designed to
          help select persons achieve their educational goals. However,
          many times most of the help or aid comes in the form of loans
          that must be paid back after the student graduates, and with
          some loans payback actually has to start while the student is
          still in school. You also have to remember something called
          the shortfall or the part of the expenses that are not covered
          by the different forms of financial aid thus leaving a monthly
          payment that must be paid directly to the school itself. This
          too is something that is forgotten about or not even thought
          of in the first place by many.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          But do not lose heart! There are many ways to get a free
          college education and this report will provide you with the
          information and resources you need to minimize or eliminate
          altogether in many cases the costly expense of education. We
          present real examples and tactics being used by real people to
          earn real degrees. The ideas and procedures found in this
          report have helped them to earn everything from Associates
          degrees all the way up to Masters degree or higher and there
          is no reason why these ideas won’t work for you. <br>
          <br>
          The following information will touch upon and examine in
          detail many if the individual ways of obtaining a free
          education. We will look at websites, programs, scholarships
          and many other opportunities that are not widely known; yet
          they are highly effective. So prepare to be catapulted into
          the very real world of free education.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter Two: Fast Web and Other Scholarship Websites</b><br>
          <br>
          There are literally thousands of philanthropic organizations
          as well as private parties who are ready and willing to give
          financial aid to students who show even the slightest degree
          of commitment and drive. The challenge is taking the time to
          sort through all of the possibilities to successfully identify
          the legitimate opportunities.<br>
          <br>
          That’s where Fast Web comes in to play. Fast Web claims to be
          the most complete source of local, national and college
          specific scholarships, Fast Web states on their website that
          they have access to 1.3 million scholarships worth over $3
          billion.<br>
          <br>
          How does Fast Web know which scholarships and grants you
          specifically are eligible for? First you go to fastweb.com and
          set up an account. The usual information is required of
          course, such as, name address, etc. However the next few pages
          ask you for very specific input, such as income, nationality,
          likes and dislikes. These seemingly random questions are not
          at all just for general information. They are designed to
          pinpoint which specific organizations that offer grants and
          scholarships will benefit you personally.<br>
          <br>
          Questions that may not appear important or better put,
          necessary, are sometimes very pertinent to obtaining certain
          scholarships. For example, stating the nationality of one may
          open the way to obtain a scholarship aimed specifically at
          minority or tribal groups.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Then, based on your survey, you will receive more information
          on how to apply for the scholarships you personally qualify
          for. Some organizations require that you write an essay
          explaining why you should receive the scholarship. Others
          simply ask you to provide proof of income or provide more
          information depending on which institution is granting the
          scholarship. After your initial survey you will find that from
          that point on, you will receive, for years to come, e-mails on
          new scholarships available to you already connected to the
          information you filled out about yourself. Then you decide if
          it sounds like something that interests you and if is an
          opportunity you would like to apply for, but the option is
          always yours.<br>
          <br>
          At any rate, as you learn the system, you will find that you
          should apply for as many grants and scholarships as you can
          and there is no limit to how many you can potentially qualify
          for. There is no guarantee of receiving the funds but the odds
          are very good that you can be among the hundreds of thousands
          that do receive this type of&nbsp; “Free Education”. <br>

          Following are a list of additional websites that will inform
          you of grants and scholarships available.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter Three: More Scholarship Websites</b><br>
          <br>
          Besides Fast web there are many other websites that claim to
          help students finance their education through scholarships. To
          assure myself of which ones are legitimate, I visited a
          financial aid office of a local private college and asked for
          up to date information on where to obtain scholarships and
          grants. The financial aid officer handed me a paper that had a
          list of the following top websites recommended by them as well
          as other colleges. Fast web as you can see is the first on the
          list, however it is followed by others that are equally
          interested in providing assistance to students looking to
          locate legitimate sources of grants scholarships.<br>

          </b><b> Chapter Four: Maintain Your Financial Aid By Being a
            Dedicated Student</b><br>
          <br>
          You wake up one morning feeling no desire to get out of bed.
          Even though you’re not sick and you know that you have class
          in an hour you still just want to lie there and think it won’t
          hurt to miss today. While this might be true in a few unusual
          cases the reality is that missing class can hurt you
          economically in the long run if you aren’t careful. The fact
          is that in terms of receiving Financial Aid for education,
          there are two conditions that must be met and maintained by
          students if they want to continue receiving such assistance. <br>
          <br>
          One criterion for receiving Financial Aid is a student’s
          completion rate. Most do not realize how financially
          devastating it can be to them if they make a habit out of
          skipping classes. Yes, if you do not complete a certain amount
          of your class time you will be cut off from and not qualify
          again for a very long time for federal financial funding. <br>
          <br>
          The government will require you to maintain a 65% completion
          rate to continue loaning funds to you. Many uninformed
          students just “blow off” their classes and get a shock later
          when college officials inform them that they have lost their
          Federal Aid and now must apply for a private loan in order to
          continue their studies. This unfortunate situation can last
          for one or in many cases several semesters. Remember, the
          completion rate average has to be recalculated and must reach
          65% and stay there for you to qualify for government
          assistance.<br>
          <br>
          Another aspect of the completion rate is the fact that the
          school must, because of government regulations, drop a student
          if a certain amount of classes are not attended. Some students
          do not understand that a chain reaction can be started with
          the end result being the loss government funding. While such
          an unfortunate situation is not impossible to recover from, if
          you find yourself in such a condition it can be difficult and
          at best very distracting when what you should be concentrating
          on most of all is your studies and keeping up good grades. <br>
          <br>
          This brings us to another very important factor in receiving
          and maintaining federal financial aid, that is, keeping a good
          grade point average. Many students are concerned about their
          GPA, however, they are not always aware of the negative impact
          it can have on their financial assistance if their grades
          drop. Failing to maintain their grades at acceptable levels
          has often caused many students to go into shock and shed tears
          when they realize that they must either get a private loan or
          leave school before graduation.<br>
          <br>
          So the next time you feel tempted too miss class for any
          reason, please remember that you could be in danger of
          negatively impacting you education in general and especially
          putting yourself at risk of losing some of the free money that
          could be potentially available to help you reach your
          educational goals.<br>
          <br>
          If you have an unavoidable situation that makes it necessary
          to miss some classes, immediately get in touch with the proper
          department at your school so they can attempt to keep you in
          good standing with your funding sources. Remember it is to
          both yours and your college’s mutual benefit to keep you in
          school. They will do anything and <br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b> Chapter Five: Reap The Benefits of College Work Study
            and Student Worker programs</b><br>
          <br>
          One of the major ways to cut down the cost of education and
          receive financial aid while attending college is through the
          numerous college work-study programs that most if not all
          institutions offer to qualifying students. Students who meet
          an accepted level of proficiency usually a grade point average
          of at least 2.0 or higher and who have an adequate completion
          rate can take advantage of such programs to assist them in
          cutting down costs and increasing their financial aid.<br>
          <br>
          These programs are designed to support diligent students who
          really apply themselves to their education. Many students are
          not aware of the fact that they can apply to work at their
          college and receive compensation. Opportunities available
          include programs where the student’s income comes directly
          from the school itself or comes from the government and is a
          part of the student financial aid program. Positions available
          include but are not limited to, tutoring, assisting in student
          services, the library, the IT department, the list goes on.<br>
          <br>
          To take advantage of these positions you must first and
          foremost be an excellent student.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Then you need to approach either the Career Development Center
          or the Financial Aid Office, since many of the in school work
          positions are actually funded by government financial aid
          programs. If you qualify because of GPA and completion rates
          then you only have to worry about the same things you would be
          concerned with when trying to get a job elsewhere. <br>
          <br>
          Many students think of this type of job as less important and
          thus give it a less than professional approach. While it is
          true that generally students attend school in various casual
          forms of attire i.e., jeans and t-shirts etc. you should
          always follow accepted rules of professionalism in dress. You
          will definitely get the preference over a fellow applicant if
          you apply for a position wearing professional dress or
          business casual attire and he is dressed like a student.<br>
          <br>
          Student workers enjoy many benefits while working for the
          school they attend. For example some of the more obvious
          benefits are you will be “close” to work after class is out.
          Think of how much commuting time you will save when all you
          have to do to get to your job is in many cases walk down a
          hallway or maybe take a few flights of stairs or the elevator
          and at most you may have to drive over to another part of the
          campus. <br>
          <br>
          Another benefit is the work experience you will obtain from
          your job. Many times recent graduates feel the frustration of
          having to wait to get that perfect job in the field of their
          choice due to needing a certain amount of real world work
          experience. However, if you have worked while attending
          college you will have a head start that can make a big
          difference in how a potential employer views you as a valuable
          employee.<br>
          <br>
          Many student workers have been hired as permanent employees by
          their colleges after and in some cases even before graduation.
          This is because they are already familiar with the student’s
          work ethic and personality. Often times new graduates are even
          offered management positions. The former student worker
          already has a good idea of how things work at the school and
          thus has an easier time of transitioning in to such a role.
          Also many times a diligent student worker has learned a great
          deal of interpersonal skills, because career focused and
          private colleges are especially customer service driven
          entities.&nbsp; This brings us to another topic regarding free
          education. Attending college for free as a company benefit.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter Six: Free Education as a Company Benefit </b><br>
          <br>
          Many companies and corporations today provide benefits to
          their employees so they can attract, hire and keep the
          best-qualified people. Benefits such as dental and medical
          insurance and pension plans do a lot to make working for a
          company and remaining a long time loyal employee a winning
          proposition for its workforce.<br>
          <br>
          While providing benefits for the worker many companies are
          interested in ways to provide both benefit to the employees
          and to the company its self. One of the many benefits that
          more and more companies offer today that help their employees
          and bring benefit to the company as well, are various Tuition
          Reimbursement and Employee Waiver Programs for employees who
          are attending college. Receiving a college education certainly
          is a great “perk” for a worker and a college-educated
          employee, in most cases, brings greater value to the job. <br>
          <br>
          Company sponsored education programs pay various annual
          amounts depending on an employee’s time on the job and the
          relevancy of the program or studies to the employee’s job
          description. Check with your HR department for details on
          available tuition reimbursement benefits.<br>
          <br>
          Another benefit to the employee is the tax exemption that they
          can receive as a student. Check with your HR department and
          your accountant to learn more about tax benefits.<br>
          <br>
          In order to qualify for tuition reimbursement programs you may
          have to meet certain reachable criteria. For example, you may
          have to agree to remain on the job for a certain amount of
          time after obtaining your degree. You might also be required
          to maintain your GPA (grade point average) at a certain level.
          You may have to show proof of classes being taken. And some
          employers may also require you to finish the program in a
          certain period of time. <br>
          <br>
          While there are usually requirements an employee must meet to
          receive free college (tuition reimbursement) from their
          employer, whatever the requirements, they are more times than
          not, very attainable and well worth the effort. <br>
          <br>
          The benefits of obtaining a higher education will follow you
          long after you move on to a different job. In cases where
          employees choose to stay and climb the corporate ladder, they
          are helping the company as well themselves. Investigating your
          employer’s details and requirements for educational tuition
          reimbursements beforehand, will help you to decide if your
          company’s tuition reimbursement plan is right for you. <br>
          <br>
          Consider the following. A very well known dental insurance
          company provides the best dental insurance to its employees.
          This pleases both the employee and the care providers and
          lends credibility to the insurance when each and every
          employee from building maintenance to the President of the
          company can say to the public at large, “I have this insurance
          and it is great.” <br>
          <br>
          [Side bar: It was disturbing to me when I asked a hospital
          employee about the service at her hospital. Her reply to me
          was, “I really can’t say, my insurance doesn’t cover me to go
          here.” End of Sidebar]<br>
          <br>
          Many automobile dealerships provide cars for certain valued
          employees to drive. This of course makes the employee very
          happy but it also helps the company’s image, when people see
          the employee driving the car the company sells instead of a
          competitor’s model. <br>
          <br>
          Another example is Airlines providing free air transportation
          to its employees. This perk not only makes employees and their
          families extremely happy it helps fill airline seats with
          happy passengers.<br>

          <b>What if the company you work for is a school?</b><br>
          <br>
          In the same vein of the examples above many if not all private
          and career focused colleges provide free education to their
          staff. What a great win/win/win situation for all three; the
          employee, the college and the students all benefit. The
          employee gets a free education in a certificate or degree
          program. The school gets a loyal employee and student and
          other students see workers at the school attending the college
          where they work, “this must be a very nice college, even the
          employees attend here.” <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          In light of the above, next, we will discuss how you can get a
          free college education simply by getting a job at your local
          private, career based college.<br>

          Question: Do you put the cart before the horse or the horse
          before the cart?<br>
          <br>
          Answer: In some instances you must put the cart before the
          horse. Read on to find out why.<br>

          </b><b> Chapter Seven: Free Education as a Company Benefit
            When Your Company is a College</b><br>
          <br>
          As we discussed in the last chapter there are employers that
          will provide its employees with a certain amount of
          reimbursement for college tuition. However, a well guarded
          secret is, many times at a college one of the employee
          benefits is being able to attend tuition free. This comes in
          various names such as tuition waiver, employee waiver, tuition
          reduction and tuition remission. The important thing to ask
          when considering these benefits in terms of free education is
          will they allow you to earn a degree while working flexible
          hours on the job.<br>
          <br>
          There was a time when I did not know about the secret of
          working at a college to attend it as a student and receive a
          free education. Let me share with you how I found out about
          this aspect of free college. I was planning on attending a
          Career-Focused college and I made the necessary visit to the
          financial aid office to determine how I would finance my
          education.<br>
          <br>
          The Financial Aid officer was running down the list of all the
          different options I was qualified to receive in order to
          finance my new career in Business Administration. She was
          friendly, knowledgeable and very talkative, that is until we
          got to a part in our conversation where I asked her about her
          being a student. <br>
          <br>
          It wasn’t being a student that she had a problem talking
          about. It was when I asked her about how working at the
          college affected her in terms of grants loans and other types
          of financial aid she was entitled to. <br>
          <br>
          I was really curious and kept on pursuing the question until I
          got her to admit in a whisper that she was actually attending
          school and earning her degree tuition free. <br>
          <br>
          It was then that I decided I would do the same. I was bound
          and determined to get myself hired at a college and thus be
          entitled to earn a degree for free. <br>
          <br>
          I eventually did get hired at a college and after the 90 day
          probationary period I did indeed become eligible for free
          college. In the 3 years I have been working there I have seen
          many come in to work for my company and also take advantage of
          this going to college for free.<br>
          <br>
          Why is it often a well-guarded secret that private and career
          focused colleges give a free education to their staff? One
          reason they do not publicize it much is the fact that a
          private career based college is also in most cases a
          “Career-Focused” college. They make their profit from the
          income they receive from students who attend their campus. You
          can understand why they save the information about free
          education for their loyal employees who they want to keep on
          the job with this extra great company perk. While recruiting
          new students a Career-Focused college wants the new students
          to focus on financing their tuition by way of student loans,
          grants, and private loans etc. and not on “getting a job at
          the college to go to school for free.”<br>
          <br>
          The benefits of a free education at the college where you work
          are obvious, in addition to the regular medical and dental
          provisions, you can set your self up in a position to receive
          a quality education close enough to walk to. Think about the
          many who leave their traditional jobs and then drive a little
          or a lot depending on the location between school and work. If
          you worked at the school in the first place then that wouldn’t
          ever be an issue. Also, working for a school and becoming
          eligible for an employee tuition waiver will even allow you in
          many cases to receive your training online if this is provided
          by your school.<br>
          <br>
          Even many traditional colleges and universities recognize
          tuition wavers to be a valuable benefit and offer a variety of
          such benefits to their staff. Such institutions believe in
          showing their commitment to higher education and thus programs
          that promote employees continued education are encouraged and
          strongly supported! <br>
          <br>
          What if you need a degree to get a job at a college in the
          first place? Don’t let college employment requiring a degree
          discourage you. Many colleges have certain entry level
          positions that may be attainable without having a degree.
          However, even in schools where an Associates or Bachelors
          degree is a requirement, a tuition waivers benefit can still
          help you to attain a higher degree, if offered at the
          particular college. Yes, you can do what it takes to earn an
          AA degree at a local city college then go on and earn a
          Masters or Doctorate degree tuition free at the college of
          your choice. <br>
          <br>
          A search online will give you plenty of colleges who are
          hiring as well as a list of benefits, which can be found on
          their websites. Don’t assume if the benefit of a free
          education is not mentioned they do not offer it. You might
          have to do a little undercover investigation to find out all
          the facts from people you know or “meet” who work for the
          college you are interested in.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously the value of obtaining your education for free at
          your place of employment has numerous benefits. Not only do
          you have a paying job with all of the other benefits that go
          along with it, but also you’ll be increasing your knowledge
          and receiving college credits for it at the same time. You
          will also be in the powerful position of putting yourself in
          line for promotions and even a career change if you so choose.
          <br>
          <br>
          Believe me, going to college for free by working at a college
          is a real possibility and it is being done by thousands of
          savvy student/employees worldwide.<br>
          <br>
          What about the question asked in the last chapter?<br>
          <br>
          Should you put the cart before the horse or the horse before
          the cart?<br>
          <br>
          What we mean by this question is this; should you get a job
          with a college you want to attend before becoming a student
          there or should you become a student first?<br>
          <br>
          Your personal circumstances dictate your answer to this
          question.<br>
          <br>
          You must keep in mind that even if you are a student at a
          private or career focused college the fact that you attend
          that college does not guarantee that you can get and keep a
          job there.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand if a college does offer a free education to
          its employees and you are an employee you will get that free
          education if you so desire.<br>
          <br>
          If you qualify for a student loan or have other means to pay
          for your first few months at the college while you are
          attempting to get hired and that is how you feel comfortable
          doing it by all means get enrolled, start school and apply for
          a job at your convenience.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand if you don’t want to start off your college
          career in debt and you don’t have other means to pay secure a
          job with the college first and after you are hired “take
          advantage” of that perk you are really after. Depending on the
          policy of your target college you may or may not want to
          mention your desire for a free education on the job
          application and the subsequent job interview. However if the
          interviewer emphasizes a free education as a company benefit
          you might want to eagerly show interest in going to school for
          free.<br>
          <br>
          Just be cautious and carefully weigh your discussion about
          free education just the same as you prepare your other words
          regarding your interview.<br>
          <br>
          If you don’t get hired do not lose heart. There is probably
          more than one private college where you can work depending on
          where you live. At the end of this report is a list of private
          colleges. This list is by no means a complete list of every
          college. Do a web search for “private college” “career focused
          college” and similar search terms and you will find that there
          are hundreds of such institutions.<br>
          <br>
          If you really can’t find a local college that meets your
          needs, consider relocating. You will find students from all
          over the world moving thousands of miles just to attend
          private colleges. Do not rule out relocating to get a free
          education.<br>

          Looking past graduation day; what now? Read on.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter Eight: After Graduation</b><br>
          <br>
          The long awaited day finally arrives! You wake up put on your
          cap and gown and show up at the appointed place surrounded by
          a mob of family and friends all with ear to ear smiles and
          loads of balloons, flowers, and other paraphernalia designed
          to show their support and congratulations for you having made
          it! Yes Graduation day is here! After the speeches and
          awarding of degrees and turning of the tassels you have if
          anything probably been inundated with one thought. The idea
          that this is by no means the end of you education yet just the
          beginning of your journey on the road to life long learning. <br>
          <br>
          Does this mean that your pursuit of free college is over? By
          no means is this true. In many cases colleges and universities
          have programs especially aimed at alumni to help keep them
          equipped with the tools they need to remain fully competent in
          their fields.<br>
          <br>
          These programs include tuition free retraining programs where
          graduates can return to their school and re-take, review and
          re-evaluate courses that were a part of their program. This
          can be very helpful especially if a graduate was already
          working in a field outside of his program and now after some
          time has passed he wishes to refresh his skills so as to
          increase his current marketability in his area of expertise.<br>
          <br>
          Some schools offer their alumni the opportunity to audit a
          class that has been updated. (to audit a class means to sit in
          on it without receiving a grade or credit for that class)<br>
          <br>
          Auditing a class allows you to stay completely up to date with
          current accepted standards and you don’t get left behind due
          to new and improved methods or more advanced technology. <br>
          <br>
          In a similar vein if an entire program is revamped or
          additional classes are added then alumni are also allowed to
          take these classes. Of course each individual school has its
          differences in how and to what extent they provide such
          services to alumni so it would be wise to investigate before
          choosing a school to insure you are getting maximum benefit if
          this particular facet of free education appeals to you.<br>
          <br>
          In most of these re-training situations you will probably
          incur some reasonable expenses such as lab fees, books and
          material fees, parking and other such expenses. These
          expenses, however, are usually minimal and really affordable
          when compared to the value of what you are getting, that is,
          constant and fresh education and information relevant to your
          career. <br>
          <br>
          Have we, in this report, covered every possible way for you to
          get a free college education? No we haven’t. Please continue
          to the next chapter.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Chapter Nine: Free College is Possible if You Think Outside
            of the Box</b><br>
          <br>
          I am sure that I have not touched on every way possible to
          obtain an education for free or at low cost but I hope that
          the ideas presented here will at least help you to understand
          that getting a free education is possible. You just need to
          investigate, ask questions, and apply for every grant and
          scholarship that comes your way as well as consider working
          for the college you attend to receive a free education.<br>
          <br>
          Remember, thousands of people today are getting a free
          education using these and other methods and there is no reason
          why you can’t do the same. Talk to students and find out what
          they are doing. Ask what types of scholarships and grants they
          are utilizing. Talk to staff at colleges and universities and
          keep your eyes open for job openings at these institutions.
          Surf the Internet for current information. Yes if you are
          determined to find a way of receiving your education at a
          tremendous discount or even for free, then you will most
          definitely find one. <br>
          <br>
          The road to free college is less traveled, however, you can
          pave your own way to a tuition free education, and live with
          the satisfaction of knowing you did it! <br>

          Note: Career Education Corporation and the Apollo Group are
          the parent corporations of many of these and other
          Career-Focused institutions.<br>
          <br>
          As you can see, armed with a list of traditional universities
          and having knowledge of other career focused colleges you have
          more than just a few colleges to choose from.<br>
          <br>
          You might be wondering if a certain college you are interested
          in is accredited. This may or may not be an important question
          with which you should be concerned.<br>
          <br>
          First of all it must be noted that there are different types
          of accreditation. Secondly depending on your goals
          accreditation may or may not be important.<br>
          <br>
          Just to illustrate, you might want to have advanced training
          in a hobby that you are already engaged in. Let’s say you have
          been arranging flowers for your friends and family weddings
          for several years. You decide you want to make some extra
          money arranging flowers and maybe even pursue it as a business
          someday. <br>
          <br>
          Your skills already prove to people that you can arrange
          flowers but some advanced techniques that you could learn at
          florist school would add to your current skills. You might
          well decide that the purpose of attending florist school is
          only to increase your skills and you do not care if the school
          is accredited. That’s fine. The techniques in this report will
          work for you.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand let’s say that you have had the hobby of
          raising and breeding puppies now you want to become a
          veterinarian. Now you probably would want to look for an
          accredited school.<br>
          <br>
          Whatever your desires and goals happen to be regarding your
          college education you must do your research. Ask questions.
          Find out how others view the college you are examining.<br>
          <br>
          If you find yourself going to a school that for what ever
          reason just is not for you, you can change to another one.
          Remember, there is always another college that would welcome
          you with open arms.<br>
          <br>
          Again: Welcome to the world of Career-Focused, private, career
          focused colleges, looking at them from the slant of going to
          college for free.<br>
          <br>
          Thank you for reading Free College.<br>
          <br>
