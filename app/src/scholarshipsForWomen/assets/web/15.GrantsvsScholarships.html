If you            cannot afford an education then you are missing out on the chance to            fulfil your own potential. This can actually have a knock on effect            on the rest of the surrounding area. You may have skills that could            be of great service to another and yet never have the opportunity to            develop them, and that is why it is extremely important to seek out            any way possible of fulfilling your potential and developing            yourself to the fullest extent. <br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">That is in fact where            scholarships come in!</font></big></big></p>    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Scholarships and grants          can provide a fantastic source of financial aid for individuals who          either deserve it in terms of their talent or are struggling as a          result of financial hardship. In some cases, the individual actually          falls under both category headings. Regardless of where they fit into          the scheme of things, talented individuals that need help can get it          from a scholarship or grant.<br>          <br>          A scholarship is a financial merit-based award that a student would          have to apply for. The scholarship may be a package of financial aid          to help the student. It could include housing and course materials as          well as tuition, or just the tuition. It may only be a percentage of          the tuition. This is dependent on the terms and conditions of the          scholarship itself and what it offers. It may last for an academic          year or for the duration of your degree course. However, it will          always have conditions attached, and this will most likely relate to          your grade point average. It would have to remain above a certain          level for you to qualify for the scholarship.<br>          <br>          A grant is totally different. Again, you would have to apply for it,          but it would be a one off payment that would be awarded to you for a          specific purpose. It may be a specific topic you are working on would          be eligible for funding and you were given a grant of a set amount to          help. You may be eligible for a housing grant if your family's income          level is below a certain level. Whatever the reason for the award, it          is a one off payment of a set amount.<br>          <br>          Scholarships can be applied for by anyone attending an academic          institution for a period of time. The application forms are usually          quite extensive and can take hours to fill in properly. One slight          mistake on the form could get it discarded, so the most important          thing for you to do is actually read through the instructions and          comply with what it is asking from you to the letter! There will          literally be thousands of candidates for any scholarship so you have          to be able to make your application stand out from the crowd in order          to obtain the funding. It does help if you have a gift for certain          ones, but the majority just want to help someone who needs the funding          and stand out from the crowd.<br>          <br>          The one rule is do not lie. If you do they will find out during the          course of their investigations and considerations, and your          application will immediately be rejected! Always be honest and show          your awards and merits up in the best light possible if you want          results. It may also be worth applying for several scholarships and          grants at any given time so that you are not putting your eggs in the          one basket. It never hurts to have a back up, especially where college          and money is concerned!<br>          <br>          Scholarships and grants can be difficult to get to grips with if you          have never had experience of them before so it is essential that you          fully understand the process and concept before beginning to apply.          Financing is important for college students these days so you owe it          to yourself to do the best you can in terms of your application. It is          your future after all!<br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>        </font></big></big>  </body></html>
