College education is expensive! A lot of          parents do a double take when their children are preparing and looking          forward to attending a community college or a state university.<br>          <br>          There are a lot of things which comprises the cost of college          education and the tuition fee is just a part of the big picture of          getting into college. Other everyday expenditure includes food,          transportation, housing, pocket money, and other miscellaneous fees          which when added up can create a significant portion in financing a          college education.<br>          <br>          A lot of families in this day and age, even if they belong to the          upper-class society, think about applying for financial aid. College          grants and scholarships are the most excellent kind of financial          assistance.<br>          <br>        </font></big></big>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Grant and scholarship            programs do not entail students or the family to pay back. These            could be of two kinds: <br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">(1) based on need,            which is given due to the financial inability of the student and the            family as a whole, and <br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">(2) based on merit,            the talent of the student like in sports, is the main consideration.            The student’s academic ability also falls under the merit-base            college grant and scholarship.</font></big></big></p>    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          Oftentimes, college grants and scholarships combine the merit and need          criteria to ease out the whole financial aid process. Numerous          students and their families are in the look-out for this type of          financial aid. However, college grants and scholarships are limited          compared with the growing number of students year after year.<br>          <br>          Qualifying students can avail of federal and a number of state          scholarship programs. Some of which are the following:<br>          <br>          Federal or National Pell Grants – this is a program funded nationwide          intended to endow assistance to any qualified undergraduate learner          pursuing postsecondary schooling. Grants and scholarships of this kind          are given to those who have not finished a baccalaureate degree.<br>          <br>          The worth of the grant can vary year after year and will depend          largely on the financial need of the students, the expenses that will          be incurred while attending the chosen university or college, and the          availability of funds from the national government.<br>          <br>          This type of grant will open opportunity for the students to avail          succeeding financial aid from the national government.<br>          <br>          Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) – this is a          program for ongoing undergraduate students with outstanding monetary          need. However, not all students can avail this type of grant. This          will depend on the eligibility of the students and availability of          finances of the concerned school.<br>          <br>          Another form of financial aid that students and families can turn to          is through loans. This type of financial assistance should be paid          back. The financial need of the family should be considered thoroughly          to avoid paying high interest rates.<br>          <br>          It is also a must to understand all the terms of lending agencies such          as the schedule of repayment and interest rates, before signing in or          making a commitment.<br>          <br>          Work study is a form of financial assistance which calls for students          to do labor to sustain their college education. Work study is commonly          done on campus and is the most typical form of financial aid in all          universities and colleges. Usually, the students will render service          to schools for ten to fifteen hours per week.<br>          <br>          Scholarships, grants and other forms of financial aid to acquire          college education is really multifaceted, confusing at times, and even          exasperating. The good thing is college education is a non-refundable          and non-biodegradable type of investment. <br>          <br>        </font></big></big>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It is for the future!</font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big> </p>  </body></html>
