Living expenses soon take          a toll on your wallet and your life. Many college students have heard          about grants, but do not take the time to research them.<br>          <br>          With effort on your behalf, grants can be an excellent source of          educational funding. There are four categories of college grants that          are available:<br>          <br>          * Student-specific usually pertains to non-traditional, low-income,          and disadvantaged students who are anywhere from the high school to          doctoral educational levels.<br>          <br>          * Subject-specific college grants are grouped according to subject,          such as health, education, or engineering. Some subject          specific-grants are meant to stimulate additional enrollment in fields          that are under-represented.<br>          <br>          * Degree level college grants are for students who are at a certain          level in their program towards their degree.<br>          <br>          * Minority college grants are for those who are considered to belong          in a minority, such as the disabled, African Americans, Native          Americans, and women. <br>          <br>          <b>Non-Traditional Grant Options</b><br>          <br>          Non-traditional grants are for students who are out of the typical          college age range. For example, if you graduated from high school, but          did not enroll in college until several years later, then you may          qualify for various non-traditional grant options. Or, if you are          starting your higher education at a community college, or through an          online campus, then there are specific student grants that can assist          your non-traditional educational endeavors.<br>          <br>          <b>Grants That Help The Disadvantaged Attend College</b><br>          <br>          Low income and disadvantaged college grants are for individuals whose          incomes prevent them from attending college. In this scenario, the          Pell Grant provides students the financial means to pay for books,          dorm rent, utilities, and food. Indeed, the Pell Grant covers all of          the college expenses for which an adult would traditionally be          responsible.<br>          The National Federation of the Blind, as well as the National          Association of the Deaf, are just two of the many grants available to          the disadvantaged college students.<br>          <b><br>            The Options Of Graduate-Level Grants</b><br>          <br>          Graduate and doctoral students can obtain grants from community          colleges, universities, or private organizations. All three seem to          compete with one another on who is providing the best grant, which          means graduate and doctoral candidates have many options when it comes          to obtaining a college grant. These graduate-level grants can be used          for research, traveling, or living expenses.<br>          <br>          <b>Grants For High School And Undergraduate Students</b><br>          <br>          High school and undergraduate college grants attract the low income          and disadvantage candidates, as well as those who are specializing in          a certain field, ranging from engineering to the arts. These college          grants can be used for living expenses, books, and dorm rent.<br>          <br>          <b>Educational Grants For Military Families</b><br>          <br>          Military families all benefit from the college grants provided by the          Navy, Army, or the Air Force. If you or your spouse enrolls in the          Army, then your spouse can apply for the Army's Spouse Education          Assistance Program - or if the Navy is your affiliation, then you can          apply for the Navy's Spouse Tuition Aid Program. Both college grants          provide you the means to pay the tuition in full.<br>          <br>          <b>Finding Subject-Specific And Degree-Level Grants For Your Major</b><br>          <br>          Subject-specific college grants pertain to individualized majors, such          as Education, IT, Engineering, Veterinarian, Ministry, and          Administrative Justice. Traditionally, subject-specific grants are          plentiful at community colleges and universities. If you have          conducted research in your major, or you have a particular focus you          are studying, then your chances of obtaining these subject-specific          college grants increase.<br>          <br>          Degree level college grants are similar to the subject-specific          college grants, as they also have specific, individualized          requirements. For example, there are junior degree level grants only          geared for those students entering into or already enrolled in junior          year. The key to these grants is to conduct research early and find          ones for which your academic standing qualify.<br>          <br>          <b>Grants Geared For Minority, Under Represented Students</b><br>          <br>          Minority college grants are for those who are considered to belong to          a minority group, such as African Americans, Native Americans, and          women. There are a wide supply of minority grants, whose goal is to          increase the representation of minorities in higher education, as well          as specific fields. For example, there are the Astraea Lesbian          Foundation for Justice grant, the American Anthropological Association          grant, the American Psychological Association Minority Fellowship          Program, and the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) Minority          Fellowships. The list of available minority grants is very extensive.<br>          <br>          <b>Finding The Best Grant For Your Education</b><br>          <br>          In order to find the best grant for you, you must conduct appropriate          research. With the many specific requirements and deadlines grants          have, the earlier you begin your research, the more likely you can          obtain the best grant for your circumstances.<br>          <br>          Consider your specific academic situation, and find the grants that          may apply to you. Research for grants in your degree, your school          year, and any disadvantaged / minority group for which you qualify.          Not only are there a plethora of online research databases, but your          university and department's academic counseling office can provide you          with grant information.<br>          <br>        </font></big></big>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Although researching            and applying for grants takes time, the financial rewards are            certainly worth the effort.</font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big></p>    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>          </font></big></big> </p>  </body></html>
