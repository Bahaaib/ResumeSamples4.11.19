          Graduate school scholarships provide college graduates or
          students who have excellent or similar academic standing with
          financial support as they continue their graduate education in
          their chosen fields. Since graduate school can be costly, a
          good alternative to pursuing one's studies without having to
          spend for it or to spend lesser than usual, would be to get a
          scholarship or a grant, aside from taking out student loans.
          Although your college diploma could expose you to more
          opportunities already, finishing your graduate school studies
          can give you an edge among other professionals in the future;
          but as is the case, going through graduate school means going
          through a lot of expenses and loans.<br>
          <br>
          As the adage goes, "What your mind can conceive, your body can
          achieve"; basically, if you are determined to pursue your
          graduate studies, nothing is impossible. In fact, graduate
          scholarships for women are there to assist you in your journey
          and they can also help you find jobs sooner than other
          graduates.<br>
          <br>
          Before you jump into the scholarship bandwagon, it is
          important to know what types of graduate scholarships are
          available. Some scholarships can provide you with financial
          assistance while others can provide you that and a job. Now,
          would you still go for the ordinary scholarship program?<br>
          <br>
          What are the different types of graduate school scholarships?<br>
          <br>
          * General Scholarships are offered to anyone with no specific
          qualification. This would mean that both men and women are
          qualified for general scholarships and the main criteria for
          sponsors to consider you would be based on your academic
          standing. These scholarships are offered by certain
          organizations and offices. Since you are looking for graduate
          scholarships for women, applying for general scholarships
          would mean that your application will be put against several
          other applications, both from males and females. Your chances
          of being rewarded student assistance are quite slim. <br>
          <br>
          * Campus-Specific Scholarships are scholarships offered by
          universities to its existing or current students. In order to
          qualify for one, you need to meet certain criteria that the
          school poses and you have to be a student of that certain
          school as well. If your school does not offer graduate school
          scholarships, you might have to transfer to another school
          that provides its students with graduate school scholarship as
          well as good incentives. <br>
          <br>
          * Federal and State Scholarships and Assistance are
          scholarships provided by the government. Some government
          offices cater solely to women and provide support for
          undergraduate, college and graduate studies. Notable sponsors
          are The Society of Women Engineers and National Women's
          Studies Association. <br>
          <br>
          * Athletic scholarships are one of the most-favored
          scholarships by both men and women students. Not only is it
          easy to qualify for one (you need to be good in sports and
          stay at an average academic level), there are also chances
          wherein national teams would sign you up to play for them
          during or after your stay in the university. If you are
          passionate about sports and about your studies, athletic
          scholarships could be your thing.<br>
          <br>
          Applying for graduate scholarships for women is easy, provided
          you have meet the requirements or qualifications and you are
          determined to become a scholar. This would mean accepting the
          duty of making sure your grades remain above average
          throughout your stay in graduate school. Simply put, it would
          mean hard work. To apply for a scholarship, it is recommended
          to check your own university first. Most universities provide
          their own students with better awards compared to programs
          sponsored by organizations.<br>
