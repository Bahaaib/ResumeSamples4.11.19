It          might be a great feather in your cap to get one of these scholarships          but your chances of doing so are almost as good as they are of winning          the lottery.<br>          <br>          For many students a better alternative would be to look for an          institutional scholarship.<br>          <br>          Almost every college will award at least one institutional (in-house)          scholarship each year and many of the larger colleges will award          several, often having scholarships available within each department of          the college. If you are attending one of the larger colleges it is          possible therefore that you could be eligible to apply for several          scholarships within your own institution.<br>          <br>          Although institutional scholarships have been around for many years,          surprisingly a relatively low percentage of students tend to apply for          them in comparison to the better known and well publicized national          scholarship programs. Now one thing to note here is that not all of          these scholarships will cover the full costs of attending college and          many will be limited to just tuition fees, or to covering only housing          costs. Nonetheless, the sums of money available are often substantial          and they can certainly reduce your college costs considerably.<br>          <br>          Many of the larger colleges will also have departments dedicated          solely to student financial aid, including scholarships, and will          provide you with details of just what scholarships are available and          how to go about applying for them. This can be a very good place to          start as you can get a great deal of information to point you in the          right direction and help to ensure that you get your application in on          time and prepared to put you in the best possible light for          consideration. You will also find that some colleges have websites          which also provide information about available scholarships, together          with details of the application procedure.<br>          <br>          For those people who are familiar with the application procedure for          nationally available scholarships, you will find that the process is          essentially the same for institutional scholarships. Each scholarship          will however have its own specific requirements and so you need to          ensure that you read these through carefully and follow the          instructions precisely. Also, be sure to check carefully to ensure          that you are eligible for a scholarship before applying. Most          scholarships will have a list of criteria which you must meet before          submitting an application and, if you are in any doubt, you should ask          the awarding body before applying.<br>          <br>          One benefit of institutional scholarships is that, because there is          less competition, you do not usually need to wait too long before          finding out whether or not your application has been successful.          Another benefit (although it may not seem like a benefit at the time)          is that, if you are not successful, you will nevertheless have gained          valuable experience of the application procedure at your college and          will therefore be better prepared when it comes to making a further          application in the second and subsequent years.<br>          <br>          If you have not investigated the availability of scholarships within          your own college then take the time to do so now and get your          applications in. If you are successful then it will certainly make          your time at college (and in the 'debt repayment' years following          college) a lot easier and you have nothing to lose by applying. If          they turn you down you are no worse off than you are now, but it they          award you a scholarship then you are sitting pretty.<br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>        </font></big></big>  </body></html>
