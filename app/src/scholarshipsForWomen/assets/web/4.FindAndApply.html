So you can see the          opportunity for you to qualify for a scholarship is not as low as you          might have imagined. In fact, many are surprised by the sheer number          and variety of scholarships which are available.<br>          <br>          <b>Free Scholarship Resources</b><br>          <br>          There are a variety of free search resources available on the Internet          to help you find the scholarship you deserve.<br>          <br>          Some web sites provide you with information regarding types of          scholarships available, the amount of the scholarship, requirements of          the scholarship, how to apply for the scholarship, and the deadline          for applying for the scholarship.<br>          <br>          Many web sites also provide a number of valuable recommendations          regarding available schools and colleges specific to your needs based          on the criteria you provide.<br>          <br>          So by dedicating some time and utilizing the Internet search engines          you can type in certain keywords which will assist you in locating a          scholarship specific to your needs. For example, you may wish to type          in: "scholarships for women over the age of 40", "scholarships for          women athletes" or just "scholarships for women" to start. By          narrowing down your search criteria you increase the chances of          finding the scholarship best suited to your qualifications and needs.<br>          <br>          <b>A Word of Warning</b><br>          <br>          You need to be aware of what appears to be legitimate scholarship          offers but may in fact be scholarship scams, especially if the          scholarship offers are unsolicited or will be provided in exchange for          some type of cost or fee.<br>          <br>          Now we want to be clear that this applies to obtaining the actual          scholarship from the supposed scholarship providers. We are not          referring to information you may purchase online or in a bookstore for          instance, that may contain extremely valuable information and tips to          help you meet your scholarship goals.<br>          <br>          The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) states on its web site that          there are many legitimate companies which advertise that they can get          students access to scholarship lists in exchange for an advance fee.          Other legitimate services charge an advance fee to compare a student's          profile with a database of college and university scholarship          opportunities and provide a list of scholarship awards for which the          student may qualify. To assist you in separating the legitimate offers          from the fraudulent offers you should always keep in mind that          legitimate companies never guarantee or promise scholarships or          grants.<br>          <br>          So, don't lose heart! Take advantage of all the resources available to          you and with persistence and research you have a very good chance of          finding the scholarship you need and deserve.<br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>          <br>        </font></big></big>  </body></html>
