        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Having a
          high
          cholesterol level has become a very serious problem for many
          people
          today.&nbsp; This has been credited to a majority of the
          population
          getting accustomed to a diet rich in fats, bad habits such as
          smoking
          and leading a sedentary lifestyle. And because of high
          cholesterol
          levels, more and more people are finding themselves at an
          increased
          risk of developing coronary heart disease as well as stroke
          and heart
          attack.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Heart
          disease is
          the number one cause of death for most people in the developed
          countries around the world. Having a high level of blood
          cholesterol
          has been linked to the increase of the incidence of heart
          disease and
          has become a grave cause of concern.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The only
          good
          news to this fact is that developing heart disease is highly
          preventable. All it takes is for one to be able to follow a
          healthier
          lifestyle. The path to such a lifestyle is trying to lower
          one's
          cholesterol level. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Although
          there
          are already several drugs available that will help an
          individual reduce
          body cholesterol levels, this is usually reserved for more
          high risk
          patients in need of drastic decreases in their cholesterol
          levels.
          There are also natural ways readily available for anyone
          looking
          forward to lowering their own cholesterol to normal and
          healthy levels.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One of
          the
          natural ways of lowering cholesterol levels is through diet.
          Following
          a low cholesterol diet day in and day out can be very
          effective in
          trying to control and maintain a normal cholesterol level.
          This would
          mean eating low cholesterol foods such as soy products,
          vegetables and
          fruits.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">High
          fiber foods
          are also known to help in the fight to lower cholesterol.
          Regular
          exercise is also a good habit to develop if you are really
          intent in
          trying to lower your cholesterol levels. Exercise helps in
          increasing
          HDL or "good" cholesterol in the body as well as strengthens
          your heart
          muscle, helps keep your blood pressure at normal and even
          helps you in
          shedding of those excess pounds.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are
          also
          several natural supplements that will be able to help you
          lower your
          cholesterol&nbsp; levels. Taking B-complex vitamins,
          specifically
          Niacin, has been known to help lower blood cholesterol in the
          body.
          supplements fortified with Lecithin can also help in lowering
          your
          cholesterol as it enables excess fat and cholesterol to be
          dispersed in
          the water instead of building up in the arteries.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are
          other
          natural ways of lowering cholesterol levels available today.
          All it
          will take is some research and talking to your doctor about
          how to
          effectively follow a lifestyle that will enable you to lower
          cholesterol the natural way.</span><br style="font-family:
