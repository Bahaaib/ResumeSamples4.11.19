        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You will
          know
          that just how healthy you are when you check your cholesterol
          on a
          regularly basis. You will also find that your doctor will
          break down
          that report so that you have several numbers and a real
          understanding
          of just how healthy you are. With all the medical advances,
          that you
          will come across you'll be able to know exactly what part of
          your
          cholesterol is out of control and how your overall progress is
          doing.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You will
          be
          getting the numbers with an explanation, but it still can be
          very
          confusing. It is very difficult to explain what you are told
          to someone
          else. You will want to get a cholesterol testing kit so that
          you can
          test yourself in the comfort of your own home. You may find
          that it is
          difficult to understand the kit, but if you learn how to do
          the math,
          then you will be able to understand your results and the
          numbers.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You will
          first
          be given a number for your bad cholesterol that is often
          referred to as
          low density lipids cholesterol. This is commonly referred to
          as "bad
          cholesterol" and you can remember this by using the L to stand
          for
          Lower-you want to be sure to lower this type of cholesterol. </span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The bad
          cholesterol will end up making about 65-75% of your total
          cholesterol,
          however, you should make sure that your total number is at
          least lower
          than 130. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Because
          LDL
          cholesterol is the type that causes heart attacks, if you have
          other
          risk factors such as obesity or a family history of heart
          disease, you
          want to keep this number even lower, less than 100 if
          possible. Your
          diet is very important in many ways, but it will lower your
          bad
          cholesterol levels.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You will
          then
          realize that your second number is your good cholesterol or
          HDL. This
          is a high density lipid cholesterol. You can always remember
          that your
          HDL is healthy by remembering the link to the "h". You will
          want this
          to be of at least 35 or higher for men, but 40 or higher for
          women.
          Women have an easier time raising HDL levels than men do, but
          this can
          be done through exercise and not smoking.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As for
          your last
          number, you will fid that it is your total cholesterol level
          that will
          add both your good and bad together. You will find that if you
          keep
          your LDL and HDL levels normal, then you will be able to have
          a good
          total cholesterol level. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However,
          you
          should consult your doctor if you have any questions about
          your
          cholesterols and the numbers. They will be able to place you
          on
          medication so that you can have a healthy life with the
          cholesterol
          under control.</span><br style="font-family:
