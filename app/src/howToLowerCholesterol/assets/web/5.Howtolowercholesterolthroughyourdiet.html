to lower cholesterol through your diet</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Although most
people believe that the trend towards cutting off cholesterol in diets
is brought on by the fact that the young generation is dieting
themselves to death; it is not so. Limiting the body's cholesterol
levels is not only for appearance's purposes but also for health
reasons. Cholesterol levels in the body, when at a certain level, can
cause a host of body complications and disease that can even eventually
cause death.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Problems like
hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes come in mind. This is
especially true with people who are already old and in their middle
ages because of the slowing down of the bodily processes particularly
the digestive system and the body's ability to convert fats to energy.
This is perhaps why most older people, especially those that have
weight issues, are being asked by their doctors to lessen their
cholesterol intake.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What
is cholesterol?</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">People have been
talking about cholesterol but do they what it is and how it affects the
body. Because of news about rising cases heart problems in the country,
cholesterol has become an overnight antagonist. Everybody thinks that
cholesterol is bad.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Actually, not
all cholesterol is bad for the body. In fact, our bodies need
cholesterol to make bile salts. It is also a major ingredients in
maintaining hormonal balance as well as in the production of Vitamin D.
Things become troubled when the levels become too high that the
cholesterol already clog the arteries, making it hard for the blood to
flow and the heart to pump.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There are two
kinds of cholesterol, the good and the bad. The LDL, which is the bad
kind, adhere to the arterial walls, forming plaques that eventually
clog the passageway. Saturated fats and the trans fatty kind are
sources of this kind of cholesterol. This is frequently found in
pre-packed foods like potato snacks and canned goods.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The HDL, on the
other hand, can lower the levels of LDL cholesterol. This is because
the good HDL helps transport the LDL cholesterol from the arterial
walls back to the liver where it is excreted out. These are found in
nuts and in seafood particularly fishes.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">People who want
to lower their LDL levels are also advised to eat a lot of fruits
because of the fiber that they bring to the body. Oats, cereals, and
legumes are also great sources of fibers that can help combat the rise
of LDL cholesterol, eventually decreasing the risk of heart disease.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Factors
that affect cholesterol levels</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Contrary to
popular opinion, it is not just the diet that should be taken into
consideration when dealing with high cholesterol levels. There are
actually a lot of factors that affect the condition. One of these is
the age and the gender. Older people are more affected by increased
levels of cholesterol because of their bodies' slowing processes.
Another factor is the level of physical activity. Exercise can actually
help in lowering down of LDL cholesterol. Also, it can help in
strengthening the body and in toning the muscles.</span><br

<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Lowering
cholesterol levels</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">From what was
mentioned above, it seems remarkably simple to lower the body's
cholesterol levels&hellip; that is if one has the discipline to see it
through. Just eat right and exercise regularly, avoid canned and
pre-packed foods and you are on your way to lower cholesterol levels.</span><br
