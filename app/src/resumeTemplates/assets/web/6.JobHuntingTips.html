    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Before submitting your resume to a prospective employer, check
          your resume for corrections at least three times before
          handing it over. After researching about the job position, it
          is critical that you format your resume to match the needs of
          the company. For example, if you are applying for an
          accounting job, you should put in detail your accounting
          experience on your resume. Typographical and grammatical
          errors are serious no-no's. It is also ideal to keep the
          length of the resume' to at least a page and a half long.<br>

          A survey conducted by a staffing and consulting firm based in
          California which corresponded with 1,400 chief financial
          officers concluded that candidates for employment made most of
          their mistakes on their interviews. Some of the mistakes they
          made include: arriving late, having little knowledge about the
          company and the position applied for, and having a superiority
          complex and behaving arrogantly. The body language of the
          applicant must also denote that he is confident yet not
          overpowering. He must maintain eye contact, have a strong
          handshake, and avoid looking defensive by the act of crossing
          the arms. Wearing the right clothes is crucial for projecting
          a confident stance. As they say, it is better to go to an
          interview over-dressed than being under-dressed.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          A common mistake of interviewees is that they tend to get
          tense and forget the questions that are given to them, which
          has the effect that they are not prepared for the interview.
          It is important to research about the company and the position
          applied for to prevent being side-tracked during the
          interview. If you do not know the answer to the questions
          being asked, it is better to admit you don't know the answer
          to the question and add that you can research about it. Look
          for the skills or expertise that the company is looking for so
          that when interview day comes and the interviewer asks about
          your strengths and core competencies, you will be able to
          match it to what they need.<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Having a referral from one of the company employees can go a
          long way toward landing an interview. A typical company may
          receive job applications in the hundreds and usually 35% to
          60% of all job vacancies are filled by referrals. The odds of
          getting hired when you have a referral are very high if you
          have another 200 to 500 applicants vying for the same
          position. If you do not know anyone from the company that may
          give you a referral, it is a good idea to the alumni network
          of your college, trade groups, social networks, and
          professional associations. Remember, having a referral greatly
          increases your chances of getting the position.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          With the current trend of technology and its merging with
          business processes, more and more companies are now requiring
          prospective applicants to submit their application online.
          Thus, first impressions are relayed not by your first
          appearance but by the quality and content of your e-mail.
          E-mails regarding job application should be polished and
          well-articulated. When applying on-line, use the following
          tips:<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Employers do not like when you send them application letters
          that seem to be too casual. It is important to make a letter
          that is both formal and well written. This gives a good
          impression regarding your capabilities and skills.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          When writing an application letter, you must be concise and
          straightforward. Do not put a story on the letter just to get
          the attention of the employer, chances are he or she will just
          get irritated with you and this only reduces your chances of
          getting hired.<br>

          Although there are instances wherein there is a lot of need
          for a job but the requirements for the position may entail
          training programs that may bar you from getting the position
          due to its highly competitive nature. Some require a lot of
          experian even at least 3 years of work experience. Some may
          have no barriers to entry but the job itself may entail a very
          routine work flow.<br>
          <br>
          Getting the job you want may be a challenge but never lose
          hope. It is better to wait a while and get the job that you
          will enjoy rather than get a job as soon as possible but
          ending up dissatisfied and unhappy. Make the right decision
          then act on it.<br>
