      <b>Career Myth #1: You can't make a living doing something you
        really, truly love</b><br>
      <br>
      This is the grand-daddy of career myths, the belief that you can't
      have a "practical" career doing something that you were passionate
      about. It has to be one or the other.<br>
      <br>
      This myth is rooted in fear. Fear that we have to sacrifice our
      happiness to make a living. Don't buy the myth that you can't earn
      a living by doing what you love.<br>
      <br>
      When I first started coaching, I heard from plenty of people that
      it would be very difficult to make a living doing this work. I
      just decided to find coaches who were successful, and to learn
      from them (simple, eh?).<br>
      <br>
      If you find yourself buying into this myth, consider this question
      - As you look back on your life, what will you regret more?
      Following your passion or following your fears?<br>
      <br>
      <b>Career Myth #2: It's a tough job market/economy</b><br>
      <br>
      Even when the newspapers and other news sources say that
      unemployment numbers remain steady, that job growth is at a
      standstill, or that we're experiencing slow economic recovery, not
      to mention downsizing and outsourcing, don't believe it.<br>
      <br>
      It's a myth because it doesn't reflect the whole story, the fact
      that that it's a different job market today. It's a changing
      economy. How we transition from job-to-job is different. Hiring
      practices have shifted. So the job market has changed, but that
      doesn't necessarily make it tougher. What makes it tougher is that
      we've been slower to change. We've held on to old practices and
      old behaviors. That's not to say that old ways still don't work,
      but they're just not as effective.<br>
      <br>
      So I challenge you to just believe that it's a perfect job market
      for you to find work. I've had my college students try this, just
      for a week, and, more times than not, several of them find job
      leads or make important connections during the week.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Career Myth #3: Changing careers is risky</b><br>
      <br>
      What's riskier than leaving what you know to pursue the unknown?
      Changing careers means leaving behind a piece of your identity -
      your "I'm a lawyer" response to the "what-do-you-do?" question. It
      might mean admitting to yourself that you made a mistake with an
      initial career choice. Or it might mean acknowledging that you're
      unsure of what's next. And smart people always know what's next,
      right?<br>
      <br>
      Nope. Successful career changers often don't have a plan. In
      Working Identity: How Successful Career Changers Turn Fantasy into
      Reality by Herminia Ibarra, she provided evidence that waiting
      until you have a plan is actually riskier than just doing and
      experimenting.<br>
      <br>
      Nothing, absolutely nothing, is riskier than not changing careers
      if you're longing to do so. Here's why: The longing won't go away.
      It will always be there, under the surface, waiting for you to do
      something about it.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Career Myth #4: Always have a back-up plan</b><br>
      <br>
      Sometimes having a back-up plan is the smart and prudent course of
      action. Back-up plans are so grown-up and responsible. But what
      happens when you're standing with one foot in and one foot out? In
      my experience, we usually close the door and retreat. We are
      reluctant to commit to ourselves, and we end up denying ourselves
      the satisfaction of playing full-out, getting dirty and sweaty. We
      end up with feelings of regret and the nagging "What if?"
      question.<br>
      <br>
      Back-up plans diffuse our energy. Diffused energy equals diffused
      results. Give all that you've got to your dream/passion/risk and
      you've got a better chance of being successful.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Career Myth #5: There's a perfect job out there for
        everyone</b><br>
      <br>
      How long have you been searching for yours? You just know, deep
      inside, that there's an ideal job that's perfect for you out
      there. It matches your personality, skills, and interests to a
      tee. And it pays well. If only you could figure it out. If only
      you knew what it was.<br>
      <br>
      Is there a perfect job out there for you? No. And here's the good
      news - there are more jobs than you can imagine that would be
      "perfect" for you. Chances are you've even come very, very close
      to a few of those perfect jobs already. So what happened? And how
      do you recognize one of these so-called "perfect jobs"?<br>
      <br>
      Ever see the perfect gift for someone, but it was months till his
      or her birthday? Then when you go to find the item later, you
      can't. Another lost opportunity and you, once again, berate
      yourself for not buying it when you first saw it.<br>
      <br>
      So maybe you've run into a perfect job in the past, but because of
      the timing, you passed by the opportunity. Or maybe you were so
      focused on something else, that you missed an obvious clue.
      Instead of dwelling on the past, which you can't change, vow to
      keep your eyes open and to look beyond the obvious.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Career Myth #6: Asking "What's the best thing for me to
        do?" is the right question</b><br>
      <br>
      This is one of the most common questions asked when considering a
      career change or a career move. It seems like a logical analysis -
      weigh the pros and cons and evaluate the balance.<br>
      <br>
      Do not ask yourself this question!! It rarely leads you to the
      answers you're seeking. It will lead you to feeling overwhelmed
      with options (sound familiar?), or feeling like you have to choose
      what's practical over what seems to be impractical.<br>
      <br>
      The question that will lead you to answers is simple (but not
      easy!!) It is "What do I really want to do?" This is a very
      different question than "what's best?"<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Career Myth #7: If you don't like your job, you're probably
        in the wrong career</b><br>
      <br>
      Cause and effect, right? One way to tell if you're in the right
      career is whether or not you like your job. If you're dissatisfied
      with your job, it's probably a sign that you need to re-examine
      your whole career choice. This is frequently what I hear from new
      clients who have decided to work with a career coach. They know
      something isn't right because they don't like their jobs. Their
      natural assumption is that their dissatisfaction is a symptom of a
      larger underlying issue - their career choice.<br>
      <br>
      This is an example of false logic. Not liking your job might be
      telling you you're in the wrong job. It doesn't necessarily mean
      you're in the wrong career. It doesn't even mean you're in the
      wrong job. You could just be working for the wrong person or the
      wrong company. It takes a skillful approach to discern the source
      of discontent, and I think it's very hard to do it on your own
      (shameless plug for career coaches here!)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Career Myth #8: Everyone needs a mission statement</b><br>
      <br>
      Do you know what your mission is? Mission statements are supposed
      to guide us, keep us on track, and help us move forward. But what
      if you don't have one? Does that mean you're destined to never
      fulfill your potential career-wise?<br>
      <br>
      A client who was a successful professional contacted me because
      she was at a career crossroads. She felt that if only she could
      find her mission in life, she would know which career path to
      take.<br>
      <br>
      She had a clear goal for coaching - find her mission! Instead, the
      most amazing thing happened. She decided that she didn't need a
      mission. She chose to trust that she was already fulfilling her
      mission statement, even though she didn't know what it was. After
      the client shifted her focus from finding her mission to living
      her life, an amazing opportunity came her way and she pursued it.<br>
      <br>
      Here's a little tip: If your mission statement is elusive, stop
      chasing it. Be still and let it find you. And in the meantime,
      keep living your life and see what happens.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Career Myth #9: Expect a career epiphany</b><br>
      <br>
      When you see a link to "Find Your Dream Job," do you immediately
      click on it to see what's there? Do you look at every "Top Ten
      Career" list out there to see if anything catches your interest?
      Do you know your MBTI type? If you do, you might be falling prey
      to the career epiphany myth.<br>
      <br>
      I'd love, love, love it if most of my clients had a career
      epiphany that indicated to them, in crystal-clear terms, their
      next step. Instead, I see career "unfoldings" or a journey of
      discovery much more regularly. That is, being willing to not
      ignore the obvious, the pokes, the prods, and listen carefully to
      the whisper within. Yep, forget harp music and angels, for most of
      us, the career epiphany is a quiet whisper.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Career Myth #10: Ignoring your career dissatisfaction will
        make it go away</b><br>
      <br>
      Oh, if only this worked in the long run!! Granted, it does work at
      first. When you find yourself beginning to question your career,
      you'll find it's rather easy to push the thoughts aside and
      pretend they aren't there. You know what I'm talking about: the
      "what ifs" and the list of regrets.<br>
      <br>
      Over time, the random thoughts become nagging thoughts. You spend
      more and more time daydreaming about options. You build your list
      of reasons to ignore your growing career dissatisfaction:<br>
      <br>
      You're too old.<br>
      You don't want to take a pay cut.<br>
      You don't want to go back to school.<br>
      You missed your opportunity 5, 10, 15 years ago.<br>
      <br>
      There is a natural fear of change. Sometimes the fear of change
      remains, but there becomes a greater commitment to living than to
      feeling the fear.<br>
