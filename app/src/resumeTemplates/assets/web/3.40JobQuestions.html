          Questions</b></span><br>

      A list of the Forty Most Common Interview Questions is below, but
      keep in mind that many other interview questions will be derived
      from these forty. When thinking about how you should answer each
      question, always consider how you can segue into one of your Key
      Selling Points. Consider, too, arriving at each interview with a
      mental list of creative ideas about what you would do in the
      position if you were hired, which one human resources manager
      says, "is a great way to impress just about any employer."<br>
      <br>
      Remember that tact and discretion are of utmost importance in any
      interview. A common, but tricky question some interviewers ask is,
      "What other companies are you considering?" Here, you'll want to
      be honest, without revealing too much information or indicating to
      the interviewer that any other job is more appealing than this
      one. Other questions that will require lots of diplomacy-and as
      little negativity as possible-include, "Why did you leave your
      last job?" and "What would you do differently if you were in
      charge of this company?"<br>
      <br>
      Finally, keep in mind that your interviewer's questions may not
      automatically educe the kind of information she needs to know. In
      the end, it is up to you-the interviewee-to provide enough details
      about yourself and your work experience that will satisfy that
      ultimate question: "Why should we hire you?"<br>
