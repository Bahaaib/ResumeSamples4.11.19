          <br>
          In preparing for a job interview it is important to list and
          plan your answers ahead of time so that you don’t panic when
          the time comes. Jotting down some of the possible questions
          and then figuring out the best answer for each will help to
          boost your confidence.<br>
          <br>
          There are ten interview questions that often times are the
          downfall of job seekers, especially if they are caught off
          guard. These top ten questions are ideal to be used when
          practicing for a job interview. The top ten questions are:<br>
          <br>
          <b>What are your weaknesses?</b><br>
          <br>
          The best way to answer this question is to minimize your
          weakness and emphasize on your strengths. Mention professional
          traits that you deem as your weakness rather than
          concentrating on negative personal qualities. Likewise, it
          would be best to mention that you are doing something to
          improve yourself professionally in order to correct your
          weakness.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Why should we hire you?</b><br>
          <br>
          This is another overwhelming question which can make any
          interviewee panic. An ideal way to handle this question is to
          start with summarizing your working experiences which may be
          important to the company. Remember be confident and show that
          you really are looking forward to becoming a part of the
          company.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Why do you want to work in our company?</b><br>
          <br>
          The purpose of the interviewer for asking such a question is
          to make certain that you as the applicant are really
          interested in the job and not just simply applying because
          there is a job opening. As an applicant you have to convince
          the interviewer that you are serious and very much interested
          in the job you are applying for.<br>
          <br>
          <b>What are your goals? Or where do you see yourself five
            years from now?</b><br>
          <br>
          It is better to answer this question with reference to
          short-term and intermediate goals rather than talking about
          some distant future. It is also advised to involve the company
          in discussing your professional goals. For instance, say that
          you see yourself as becoming a part of the company and helping
          it in achieving it goals and missions. Most interviewers asked
          this type of question to gain insight on the real motive of an
          applicant since there are some applicants who will just make a
          company their training ground and then after they have gained
          some experience leave to search for another job.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Why did you leave or why are you leaving your current job?</b><br>
          <br>
          This is another question used to weigh the professionalism as
          well as the ability of an applicant to stay on a job. As an
          applicant it is not nice to say anything negative about your
          current or previous employer since it may reflect a badly on
          you. This will also create a “big question” in the mind of the
          interviewer why you are making such discriminatory remarks
          regarding your previous job. To prevent falling into this trap
          just say that you are looking for additional opportunities to
          enhance further your professional knowledge.<br>
          <br>
          <b>When were you most satisfied in your job?</b><br>
          <br>
          Again, be very careful in answering this type of question
          since this will reflect a lot about you as a potential
          employee. A not so convincing answer may cause you to lose the
          chance of getting that job you want. Try to answer this
          question without any prejudice to your previous job, and
          concentrate more on discussing things that motivate you
          professionally. This will create the impression that you are a
          good employee since you refrain from creating any bad remarks
          regarding you previous job plus this will provide your future
          employer with ideas on how to motivate their employees.<br>
          <br>
          <b>What can you do for us that other candidates cannot offer?</b><br>
          <br>
          Some applicants usually go blank when asked this question for
          fear that they may answer inadequately. Be confident and
          concentrate on discussing your positive traits and work
          qualifications that you deem as important and relevant to the
          job you are applying for.<br>
          <br>
          <b>What three positive things would your last boss say about
            you?</b><br>
          <br>
          Simply tell them of your positive traits both as a person and
          as an employee which are noticed not only by your previous
          employer but likewise by your co-employees. Think of positive
          remarks that your previous boss may have told you and read
          through any performance related assessments you may have had
          for inspiration.<br>
          <br>
          <b>How much salary are you seeking? Or how much salary are you
            expecting?</b><br>
          <br>
          When an interviewer asks you your salary requirements, it
          usually means they like you and considering hiring you to
          become a part of their company.<br>
          <br>
          Some employers would even ask your salary history from your
          previous jobs. This will provide them with an idea of how much
          you would consider asking from them. A safe way of answering
          such a question is to ask for a salary that is similar or
          close to what you is previously receiving. Or simply tell them
          that you are willing to receive any amount that is rightfully
          commensurate to the position or the job you’re applying for.<br>
          <br>
          <b>If you were an animal, what can of animal would you be?</b><br>
          <br>
          This question is geared more on knowing the personality that
          you have. Try to think of animals that are not harmful but
          rather exhibits good qualities that match with the type of
          position you are applying for.<br>
