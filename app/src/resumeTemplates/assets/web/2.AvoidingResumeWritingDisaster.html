        Writing Disaster</span><br>
      <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight:
        bold;">Statistically Proven Resume Errors</span><br
        style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    </div>
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Wouldn’t it
      be wonderful to get inside the mindset of Human Resource
      departments and employers and know exactly what they’re looking
      for in an applicant’s resume and Interview? It’s always difficult
      to know how a given employer will react to specific elements of
      your resume – is it a positive thing to be in demand, undertaking
      interviews at many companies, or does it suggest you’re disloyal
      to your potential new boss? Is being in a job a long time a sign
      of loyalty or stagnation, and is looking to move on quickly from
      company to company a sign of ambition or simply job hopping? <br>
      <br>
      Well, of course the response varies from person to person but a
      few surveys on the subject give some indication of general trends
      of opinion from surveyed employers on topics from lies on a resume
      or covering letter to the pedantry of human resources departments.</span><br
      style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The first
      point of interest from these statistics is that 86% of
      interviewers surveyed are sceptical of resumes and applications
      forms, and believe that there are at best exaggerations and at
      worst downright lies. The same survey indicates that just over a
      third of resumes are 100% factually accurate. Overlooking the
      dishonesty inherent in the whole process for a moment here, it
      seems it’s right for the employers to be sceptical – and as such
      there is a real advantage in being honest and up front when resume
      writing and in your interview.<br>
      <br>
      Convince your interviewer that you are the honest type and that
      there are no lies on your resume or covering letter, and you’re in
      the honest attractive minority - that bit more likely to receive a
      job offer at the end of the interview process.</span><br
      style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">On a related
      note, having reliable and complimentary references is essential.
      59% of those surveyed mentioned having to withdraw job offers to
      successful applicants on the basis of poor references – to be so
      close, only to fail on a poor reference either means exaggerated
      resume, or a poor choice of referee. By being truthful (though
      bold) with your resume writing, and ensuring your references are
      prepared to give solid endorsement, you can not only ensure that
      you avoid the heartbreak of a withdrawn job offer, but also
      guarantee that you are a superb backup candidate should this fate
      befall your competitor! <br>
      <br>
      According to the survey, 85% of interviewers contact at least one
      reference to ensure they’ve got the right person for the job –
      this is one corner that should not be cut!</span><br
      style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Here’s a fact
      likely to perturb the thousands of youngsters graduating the
      University system each year – only 8% of interviewers in the UK
      believe that academic qualifications give any indication to a
      candidate’s job suitability. Obviously doctors, scientists and
      academics will need a good University degree, but it appears the
      best resume writing strategy is to concentrate on the attitude,
      skills and knowledge, rather than to rely on your academic
      qualifications. <br>
      <br>
      With such little credence seemingly given to ‘book smarts’ it
      appears insane for anyone to lie on a resume and forge
      qualifications – but people do! It’s a foolish risk to take,
      especially when you consider that two thirds of interviewers check
      up on professional qualifications, and well over half check up on
      academic accreditation claimed!</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Finally, when
      it comes to posting your application through, here’s some eyebrow
      raising stats about the nature of HR departments from the UK Mail
      Postal Service: 83% of them will reject incomplete or inaccurately
      addressed resumes and covering letters out of hand, 55% of them
      gave significant favour to those addressed to a named person and
      over 60% found applicants including a photo resulted in lowering
      their opinion of the person applying. </span><br
      style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Apparently a
      little more care and research in the distributions of applications
      along with a little less vanity will go a long way to impressing
      human resource managers with your resume and covering letter!</span><br
