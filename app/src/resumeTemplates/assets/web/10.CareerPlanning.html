          Whether you are about to graduate from college, or want to
          change jobs at a later point in life, career planning is a
          very important aspect of the process.&nbsp; Before you
          actually start applying for positions, it is essential to be
          certain of the areas you would like to work in.&nbsp; The
          worst thing that could happen is not to take any steps in the
          career planning process, and end up in a job that you are
          unhappy with, or do not have the proper skill set for.<br>
          <br>
          Career quizzes are often helpful in the career planning
          process.&nbsp; These are often a great first step when trying
          to determine what type of jobs you'd be best suited for.&nbsp;
          Many are available online, and address some of the following
          areas:&nbsp; identifying your skills and abilities;
          determining if you prefer working with people, data or things;
          or summarizing what workplace values are most important to
          you.&nbsp; By compiling all of this information, you'll
          usually get a general idea of what fields you should be
          seriously checking out.&nbsp; The quizzes often list suitable
          occupations based on your answers.<br>
          <br>
          One avenue that would be best to explore is signing up for
          career counseling.&nbsp; There are many free services, mainly
          ones offered by the government, or at post-secondary
          institutions, that will get you started on your career
          planning journey.&nbsp; Career counselors are trained
          professionals that will be able to offer you advice and make
          realistic recommendations on what area you would be best
          suited to work in.&nbsp; They will look over your academic
          training, and often administer aptitude tests to see what
          careers you should be exploring.<br>
          <br>
          Researching companies that you could picture yourself working
          for is another great step in the career planning
          process.&nbsp; Check out their websites for information, and
          to see what type of positions they may be hiring for.&nbsp;
          When possible, try to set up a meeting with a member of the
          department you'd like to be a part of, so that you may ask
          them questions and find out about the day to day aspects of
          the company on a more intimate level.&nbsp; Check the
          newspapers and magazines to see if the company is mentioned at
          all, and see if the articles are favorable or not.&nbsp;
          Although this may seem very simple, it can be a valuable part
          of your career planning.<br>
          <br>
          If you think you may need to go back to school in order to
          make a career change, obtaining a catalogue from a local
          post-secondary institution is a good way to kick start career
          planning.&nbsp; Look through what programs are offered, what
          skills are required to be accepted to programs of interest,
          and what type of a time commitment you'd be looking at in
          order to make this change.&nbsp; See if prior employment or
          life experience will work in your favor, and give you advanced
          standing into your selected programs.&nbsp; People often
          forget to check into educational requirements for certain
          careers, and may waste time and energy by skipping this step
          in the career planning process.<br>
          <br>
          An often underrated aspect of career planning is talking with
          your friends and family.&nbsp; Discuss with them in detail
          what it is they do, and ask them to honestly tell you what
          they could picture you doing for a living.&nbsp; Who knows?
          They may see something that you've overlooked, and it could be
          the missing link to your career planning process.<br>
          <br>
          Career planning is something that everyone is faced with at
          some point in their lives, and it should not be taken lightly,
          although you can have some fun with it.&nbsp; Most important
          of all is to be honest and realistic with yourself, and make
          sure you ultimately choose a path that will make you happy and
          keep you financially secure.<br>
