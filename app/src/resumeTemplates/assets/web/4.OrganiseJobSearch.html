        The job search process involves a lot of planning and attention
        to detail, so it’s no wonder that many people quickly feel
        overwhelmed and even a bit out of control. The best way to avoid
        this is to organize your job search so that you have a clear
        strategy outline and a structured schedule to keep you moving
        forward.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Outline your strategy</b><br>
        <br>
        Start by creating an outline of your job search strategy. List
        the tactics you intend to use, and the amount of time you will
        devote to each tactic. A typical list might include the
        following:<br>
        <br>
        · Network with contacts<br>
        · Search online job sites<br>
        · Search newspaper ads<br>
        <br>
        Some employment experts say that less than 20% of all jobs are
        found through the newspaper or online, with the other 80% found
        through networking. Knowing this, decide how much time you are
        going to devote to your job search, then allocate that time
        accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Define the steps</b><br>
        <br>
        Next, for each tactic create a list of the steps involved. Here
        is what this might look like for the “Network with contacts”
        tactic:<br>
        <br>
        · Call the contact<br>
        <br>
        · Ask to meet for 30 minutes to get their feedback and
        suggestions on your resume as well as your job search strategy<br>
        <br>
        · Confirm the date, time and location of the appointment<br>
        <br>
        · Meet with contact, taking notes on the conversation and
        collecting one or two referrals to other contacts you might meet
        with<br>
        <br>
        · Follow up meeting with a thank you note<br>
        <br>
        · Check back with contact after one to two months if you are
        still searching for a job<br>
        <br>
        Once you have the steps listed, you will have created a
        checklist for yourself to help make sure you complete each step
        along the way.<br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Create a schedule</b><br>
        <br>
        Now create a schedule of daily activities so that you are doing
        something with your search each day. A basic schedule might look
        like this:<br>
        <br>
        <b>Morning</b><br>
        <br>
        - Call two contacts to set up networking appointments<br>
        - Write questions to ask during each appointment<br>
        - Prepare resume packet for each appointment made<br>
        - Prepare and send resumes for job found online or in the
        newspaper<br>
        <br>
        <b>Afternoon</b><br>
        <br>
        - Attend networking appointment (if previously scheduled)<br>
        - Write thank you note following appointment<br>
        - Check one or two online job sites<br>
        <br>
        <b>Weekend</b><br>
        <br>
        - Prepare for new week<br>
        - Check online job listings<br>
        <br>
        <b>Track each activity</b><br>
        <br>
        For each tactic, track all of your activity. You can use
        computer software or a plain notebook with blank pages. The idea
        is to keep notes on each day’s actions, checking them against
        your master checklist for the tactic.<br>
        <br>
        Let’s use an example. You want to make a networking appointment
        with Suzy Smith, so start with a blank page and put her name at
        the top, along with relevant contact information. Each time you
        do one of the steps defined as part of networking (make the
        phone call, prepare a resume packet, go to the appointment,
        etc.), mark it down on Suzy’s page. Note the date, time, action
        taken, and any notes you may have.<br>
        <br>
        Tracking your activity creates two benefits. First, when you
        have multiple activities happening at the same time it is very
        easy to get confused or lose track of steps that still need to
        be taken. Using your tracking log, it is easy to see at a glance
        where you are at with each activity and what next step is coming
        up. The second benefit is that it keeps you focused and active
        in your job search. It is easy to procrastinate and postpone
        looking for a job, but if you have to note daily activities in a
        tracking log you will feel more motivated to get moving and take
        action.<br>
        <b><br>
        </b><b>Action items</b><br>
        <br>
        Finally, keep a separate list of “action items” that need
        attention right away. If, for example, a contact tells you about
        an open position at a colleague’s company and suggests you call
        about it, this goes on your action item list to be handled
        within 24 to 48 hours. This list is a great way to deal with
        emergent issues and opportunities, while still staying organized
        and keeping up with your regular schedule.<br>
