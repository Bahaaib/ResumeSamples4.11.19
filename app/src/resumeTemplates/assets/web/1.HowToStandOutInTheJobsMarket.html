        To Stand Out In The Jobs Crowd</span><br style="font-family:
        Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    </div>
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Have you got
      what it takes to secure an executive role? Job hunting is
      stressful.
      Just spending time looking for appropriate jobs in the paper or on
      the
      internet is frustrating and you know that when you find one or two
      executive appointments that you want to apply for, you will be up
      against a lot of competition.</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Standing out
      from the crowd is important at every stage of the process. From
      your CV
      to your final interview, you want to be the candidate that
      impresses.
      Whether this is your first executive position, or you are a
      seasoned
      senior manager, you still need to make your application and
      interview
      different enough to secure the job.</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you’re
      dealing with an executive recruitment agency, there are three key
      areas
      where you need to be on top of your game in order to increase your
      chances of success:</span><br style="font-family:

      On the Phone</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Often, your
      first direct contact with a recruitment firm is on the phone. A
      telephone interview is a real test of your skills, because you
      can’t use eye contact of body language to reinforce what
      you’re saying; you have to rely on being prepared, focused and
      flexible so that you create a great impression.</span><br
      style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

      Your CV</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The key here
      is
      to focus on your achievements and experience, making everything
      you put
      on your CV directly relevant to the position. The internet is
      awash
      with information on how to make your CV more presentable, but
      there are
      some key points to remember:</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">• Keep it
      short</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">• Keep it
      relevant</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">• Put your
      contact details at the top</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">• Focus on
      things you've achieved, rather than your skills</span><br
      style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight:
      bold;">3.
      Your interview</span><br style="font-family:
      Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The interview
      for an executive appointment – either as a preliminary with the
      recruitment agent or a first or second interview with the company
      – is your best opportunity to show that you will be an asset to
      the business. Self-confidence is important, but not to the point
      where
      it could be viewed as arrogance. Use positive language and
      positive
      body language, give examples to show how you have achieved results
      in
      your current position and ask intelligent questions. Make sure you
      have
      researched the company well before your interview and double-check
      the
      requirements of the job.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. After The Interview</b><br>
      <br>
      One of the many steps that you can take, after your job interview
      has ended, is by going out of your way to thank the interviewer.
      In most cases, you will find that this person would be your
      supervisor if you were to get the position. Be sure to thank them
      for the job interview opportunity. Also, if you had a scheduling
      conflict or were late to your job interview, be sure to thank the
      interviewer for being patient and accommodating to you. This may
      improve your chances in more ways than you could have ever
      imagined, especially if you were late. Be sure to shake hands.
      Many view this as the “official,” closing of a job interview.<br>
      <br>
      When you leave the interview room, there is a good chance that you
      would have to walk through the rest of the establishment. Whether
      you have to walk fifty feet or five hundred feet, there is a good
      chance that you will come into contact with other individuals,
      namely other employees. Be sure to acknowledge them with a quick
      hello as you pass. This is particularly important if a company
      supervisor is escorting you from the building or at least watching
      you leave. Acknowledging other coworkers shows that you are able
      to go out of your way to get along with them. This is a good sign
      that you may be a great team player.<br>
      <br>
      Once you return home, you will want to prepare a thank you letter
      to mail out to the interviewer. There are many individuals who
      have pre made thank you letters. In fact, some will even mail out
      their thank you notes on their way home from the interview. While
      it is possible to do so, you may want to add a personal note to
      your thank you letter. This will help to prove it wasn’t a
      necessarily a preplanned gesture. With that in mind, the sooner
      that you can mail out your thank you note, the better shape you
      will likely be in. You will want to try and have your thank you
      note reach its recipient before an official decision has been made
      on who gets the job.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of different ways that you can go about landing
      your dream job even after the job interview has concluded. What is
      nice is that these steps are relatively easy to implement. In
      fact, you rarely have to take any special action. These steps may
      not always lead you to be hired for the job, but there is no harm
      in taking a chance.</span><br>
    <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The executive
      appointments market is a competitive one, and following these
      steps
      could increase your chances of success.</span><br>
