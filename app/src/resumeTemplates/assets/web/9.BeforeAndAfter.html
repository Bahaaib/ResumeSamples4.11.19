          With so many people seeking employment, how could one make it
          to an available slot? Well, the resume matters, it is the best
          reflection of how qualified is you for a certain position. In
          order for you to make it for that job position, you need to
          equip your self with the weapons to excel over the other
          applicants. That is, to impress the employer in your job
          interview.<br>
          <br>
          What must you do?<br>
          <br>
          <b>Before the interview:</b><br>
          <br>
          * Know the company you are applying for. How could you do
          this? Research about the facts and figures of that company you
          are eyeing. With the information you have about it, you would
          be ready to whatever questions the interviewer would throw
          you. You could even associate your answers to facts you have
          known about the company.<br>
          <br>
          * Expect the questions to be asked and be prepared to answer
          the. On the other hand, be prepared to ask questions.<br>
          <br>
          * Make sure that you are prepared with how you would look. The
          way you dress up would leave impressions to the interviewer.
          Do not wear too much accessories, you just have to wear
          something decent, ironed, and the shoes must be clean as well.
          Take note of your teeth as well, they could really be distract
          the interview if you left a piece of meat between your teeth.<br>
          <br>
          <b>On the interview:</b><br>
          <br>
          * Punctuality matters most. There is a need for you to arrive
          early for the interview. This would be the best first acts you
          could do. When you arrive late, this already a move to give
          your employer a negative impression of you.<br>
          <br>
          * Act as a professional to everyone you get along with or
          meet. With this approach, you would be able to introduce your
          self as someone professional, ready to take the challenges in
          the arena of professions.<br>
          <br>
          * Answer questions with the eye contact to your interviewer.
          Be attentive when he/she asks question.<br>
          <br>
          After the interview:<br>
          <br>
          * Say thank you to the interview. This is a really great act
          you could do. This would indeed show that you take the
          interview as a rich part of your experience.<br>
          <br>
          * Relax and wait for the results.<br>
          <br>
          Good luck with your career.<br>
