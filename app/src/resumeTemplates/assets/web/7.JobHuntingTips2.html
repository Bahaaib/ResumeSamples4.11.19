          Hunting for jobs nowadays is a very competitive and sometimes
          cut-throat affair. Here are a few tips to help you get the
          edge in searching out and landing the job of your dreams.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Resume</b><br>
          <br>
          The Resume is the first, and at most times the most important
          part of applying for a job. Since potential employers have to
          whittle down practically hundreds of applications to a few
          valid ones, they will have to base their narrowing down
          efforts using the Resumes they have collected.<br>
          <br>
          Studies have shown that about half of the employers decide to
          accept or reject job applications based on the related work
          experience listed in the Resume. A third of the employers
          decide to reject or accept these job applications based on the
          layout design of these applications.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1. Make Your Resume Stand Out</b><br>
          <br>
          When preparing your Resume, make sure your Resume stands out
          among the rest. It should be the type that is appealing to the
          eyes, making the evaluating personnel want to read the Resume.
          Step two is for you to make sure your Resume lists the related
          work experience you have had in relation to the job you are
          applying for.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Make Your Resume Concise and Relevant</b><br>
          <br>
          Avoid making your Resumes too long. It may make it irrelevant
          to the evaluator. Remember that the employer is a person to
          whom time is important. If your Resume shows that you value
          his/her time while showing the most relevant information in
          the least amount of time, you will have won one important
          battle.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Always tailor your Resume to the job</b><br>
          <br>
          You may have had previous experience that may not be related
          to the job you are applying for. Some people keep many
          different versions of their Resume for different job opening
          purposes. Make sure your Resume is appropriate for the job. A
          one-size-fits-all Resume may not be the best way to go since
          the employer will have the impression that your previous
          efforts have not been focused enough to produce any
          specialization on your part.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>4. Write about your achievements</b><br>
          <br>
          You may add your achievements, but make your statements
          factual and relevant. It does not do harm to advertise
          yourself, but make your advertisement matter-of-fact and not
          just hot air. You may want to skip on listing your weak points
          as the Resume is not the avenue for such <b>discussions.</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>5. Polish Your Resume</b><br>
          <br>
          Your employer will know if you have put enough time producing
          your Resume. If he/she sees that you have put sufficient and
          thorough effort into your Resume, he/she will assume that you
          will do the same in your work. This is a big plus for you. It
          is not uncommon for some people to spend days or even weeks
          polishing and buffing their Resumes.<br>
