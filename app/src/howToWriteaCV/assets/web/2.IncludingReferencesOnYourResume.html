            References On Your Resume </span></big></big><br

        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Have you
          ever
          wondered what the most commonly used line on a resume is? It
          would have
          to be the all time favorite, “References available upon
          request.” There is an ongoing debate among professionals about
          the inclusion of references on your resume. Some people will
          strongly
          encourage you to include the aforementioned line at the bottom
          of your
          resume. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In a way,
          this
          lets your potential employer know that, if asked, you can name
          at least
          a couple of people that think you are a great asset to any
          company. The
          opposing side will argue the validity of this line as it
          doesn’t
          provide any information with a call to action; we should
          operate under
          the assumption that every professional with a resume will be
          able to
          provide references from his previous employers. And yet
          another group
          of professionals will urge you not only to include this
          section in your
          resume, but list anywhere from three to five references, along
          with
          their titles, contact numbers and a description of your
          relationship to
          them. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So, how
          do you
          know who to listen to? </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">We
          advocate
          mentioning references no matter what. It is proper resume
          etiquette
          that you include a section for your references at the bottom
          of your
          resume. This lets your potential employer know that you not
          only have
          professional references but you understand that checking
          references is
          an important part of your interview process. Additionally, you
          will
          want to have an employer request references from you so that
          you can
          let your references know they can expect to be contacted.
          Listing
          someone as your reference on your resume without letting them
          know,
          even if they have previously provided a reference for you, is
          not a
          good practice. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You don’t
          want anyone on your reference list to be caught by surprise
          when they
          are contacted; you’ll want to let them know about the job you
          are
          applying for so that they know which qualifications they
          should
          highlight when they are contacted. If you are posting your
          resume on
          job search web sites, such as monster.com, or are working with
          a head
          hunter to find the best opportunities for you, it is best that
          you
          simple use the line, “References available upon request” at
          the end of your resume. As indicated above, you will want to
          let your
          references know ahead of time if they will be contacted by a
          potential
          employer. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Listing
          references on your resume and making it available to multiple
          employers
          for review may result in calls to your references by employers
          you may
          not have even been in touch with directly. Obviously, you’ll
          want
          to avoid this kind of annoyance to people you are using as
          references.
          You don’t want to abuse your relationship with them; therefore
          don’t include a full listing of references on your resume if
          you
          are making it available to masses. If you are sending a resume
          to a
          specific employer, after you have been in touch with the
          hiring manager
          or someone at the company that will refer you for the job you
          are
          interested in, we suggest including references on your resume.
          This
          allows your potential employer to have all the information
          necessary to
          consider you as a serious candidate for the job. </span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
          reference
          list should include the person’s name, their title and the
          company they are working for, their relationship to you and
          their
          day-time telephone number. As a best practice, before you
          submit the
          resume, let your references know about the job opportunity,
          and that
          you are passing along their contact information to the
          potential
          employer. If you have already submitted a resume without
          references,
          but are going to meet with the employer for an interview,
          bring a
          printed copy of your resume that includes a list of
          references. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Following
          a good
          interview, employers typically check references – as a best
          practice, you will want to provide the hiring manager with a
          one-stop-shop of your qualifications and your references, so
          you should
          always bring a printed copy of your cover letter, your resume
          and
          references with you to an interview. Your vigilance is sure to
          make a
          great impression and bring you one step closer to getting the
          job you
          want. </span><br style="font-family:

        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Composing
          a
          resume is a difficult task, as we all know. It takes time and
          patience
          to fit your whole professional history within one or two
          pages, and
          present yourself as the best candidate for the job. While we
          focus so
          much of our energy on what to include in our resumes, we
          forget to stop
          and think about the information that should never be included.
          The
          following five items are at the top of the The Resume Don't
          list: Do
          not get personal.</span><br>
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Any
          information
          that discloses your demographics should not be listed in your
          resume.
          Your age, race, ethnicity, religious beliefs, marital status,
          physical
          appearance, or your personal philosophies are not critical to
          your job
          performance, and therefore should never be listed on your
          resume.
          Present yourself as a professional to your potential
          employers. </span><br style="font-family:

          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your
          resume is
          not a list of your hobbies or interests; it is a listing of
          your
          education, your qualifications and your employment history.
          Stick to
          the information relevant to the job and your career objective.
          Do not
          list salary information or requirements on your resume. This
          is a
          strict rule, and you must follow it. Your employer is
          concerned with
          what your desired salary is, not what you earned in your first
          job out
          of college. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you
          are asked
          to provide salary requirements, do so in your cover letter not
          your
          resume. As a best practice, always list a minimum you are
          willing to
          accept for the job, and avoid using a salary range. Do your
          research
          and know what the acceptable salary is for the job of your
          interest.
          Whenever possible, leave all salary conversations to for the
          interview
          with your potential employer. Do not use jargon or too many
          “big
          words.” </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Unless
          you are
          absolutely certain that the person reading your resume will
          understand
          the terminology you are using, avoid using jargon in your
          resume. Gear
          your resume toward recruiters rather than an immediate hiring
          manager,
          because the human resources associates are usually the first
          to scan
          your resume. You should showcase your knowledge of a
          particular field
          through your education and experience; thus, jargon doesn’t
          have
          any place on your resume. In addition, avoid using too many
          “big
          words.” Don’t hide behind your vocabulary; making your
          resume overbearing is sure to lose the interest of your
          employer. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Use the
          action
          words that are relevant to your career level. Do not list your
          personal
          web site. As a rule, do not include your personal web site if
          it
          contains your photo or other photos that may be viewed as
          inappropriate, if it contains jokes (even if they are clean
          jokes), or
          your blog. In other words, if the site you have is entirely
          for
          personal purposes, you are best leaving it off your resume. </span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Only
          include a
          link to your web site if the pages are set up to showcase your
          professional portfolio, a copy of your resume, reference
          letters,
          presentations, photos taken for professional use, or your web
          development skills. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do not
          have any
          typos. </span><br style="font-family:

        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The most
          important factor in achieving a winning resume is proof
          reading. You
          want to put your best foot forward. If your resume contains
          grammar and
          spelling problems, your potential employer will get an
          impression that
          you are not detail-oriented. </span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is
          hard to
          proof a document you have been working on so closely – use
          spell
          check (but be ware, it will not catch everything), ask your
          friends for
          help, meet with a career counselor. Do your best to present
          the most
          polished resume to your potential employers.</span><br
