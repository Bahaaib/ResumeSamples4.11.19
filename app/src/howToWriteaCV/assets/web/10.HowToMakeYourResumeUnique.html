          A resume is a
          one-to two-page document summarizing your career
          objectives,&nbsp;
          professional experiences and achievements, and educational
          background.
          To&nbsp; stand apart from other candidates, you should
          consider the
          information in your&nbsp; resume carefully and make sure that
          it is
          personal to you. <br>
          <br>
          Here are three
          tips on&nbsp; making your resume unique to you:&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Customize
            your career objective.</b> Think of your whole resume as a
          sales&nbsp;
          tool; your career objective is your opening statement. You
          want
          your&nbsp; employer to know what you want, not just restate
          what other
          people want.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          State your
          commitment to your career goal. If you are unsure of what
          you&nbsp;
          want, how is your employer to believe that you really want the
          job at
          their&nbsp; organization and you are not just applying because
          you want
          to get out of&nbsp; your current work environment? Don’t be
          afraid to state what you want&nbsp; from a job and from an
          organization.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <b>2. While you
            want to state your commitment, you also want to show that
            you&nbsp; are
            willing to take action to achieve your goal.</b> Indicate
          what direction
          or&nbsp; action you are willing to take in order to accomplish
          your
          career objective.&nbsp; Lastly, be specific about what you are
          looking
          for in a work situation. <br>
          <br>
          While&nbsp; you
          can say that you are looking for a “challenging”
          environment, this&nbsp; doesn’t mean anything to your
          employer,
          as people define challenges in&nbsp; various ways. Avoid using
          generic
          and broad terms. Simply state what you&nbsp; want, and what
          you are
          willing to do to get it.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Highlight the
            best elements of your experience.</b> This is the most
          commonly&nbsp;
          missed aspect of writing a resume. The entire professional
          experience&nbsp; section on your resume is unique to you. Take
          advantage of that. Use&nbsp; power words to list your
          responsibilities,
          and make sure that you have a&nbsp; winning attitude in each
          of
          statement.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Focus on
            those responsibilities</b> that best describe the skills you
          acquired&nbsp;
          while in each job that make you the most qualified candidate
          for
          the&nbsp; position you are seeking. Quantify your
          responsibilities when
          possible to&nbsp; showcase to your potential employer that you
          are
          drive by results and are&nbsp; capable of exceeding goals.
          Don’t
          be shy about promoting your&nbsp; qualifications – you earned
          them with your hard work and dedication.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Personalize
            your cover letter. </b>The biggest mistake professionals
          make is&nbsp; not
          spending any time on their cover letter. Your cover letter
          should&nbsp;
          receive the same attention as your resume as they go
          hand-in-hand.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Address your
          cover letter to the appropriate person at the company&nbsp;
          (contact
          info is typically listed in the job description). Make sure to
          mention&nbsp; what position you are applying for, and
          demonstrate how
          the information in&nbsp; your resume aligns well with the job
          requirements.&nbsp; Your cover letter also allows you to
          address any
          information in your resume that&nbsp; may raise questions –
          take
          the time to do so, as you don’t want your resume&nbsp;
          discarded
          because you chose not to create a personalized cover letter. <br>
          <br>
          Overall, make
          sure that your cover letter supports your resume and presents
          you as
          the&nbsp; most qualified candidate for the job.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          ELECTRONIC
          RESUMES&nbsp; There are two most commonly used methods for
          electronic
          resume submission:&nbsp; uploading your resume to the
          employer’s
          web site or to the resume bank, and e- mailing your resume to
          the
          employer. Faxing or mailing your resume is virtually&nbsp; an
          obsolete
          practice, because employers are heavily relying on
          software&nbsp;
          programs that scan resumes for key words related to the
          available
          positions at their organizations.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          However, printed
          resumes are necessary for interviews. Thus,
          professionals&nbsp;
          essentially have to have two versions of their resume. While
          there are
          numerous&nbsp; resources for composing a more traditionally
          formatted
          resume, many&nbsp; professionals are not sure how to create
          electronic
          resumes that will get noticed. <br>
          <br>
          Create a plain
          text file of your resume. While you want certain items
          on&nbsp; your
          resume to stand out, you should still have a plain text file
          (.txt
          file) of&nbsp; your resume. Most employers request a plain
          text file,
          because they can&nbsp; run the file through computer software
          that
          scans your resume for key&nbsp; words related to the available
          jobs. <br>
          <br>
          When creating a
          text file, makes sure&nbsp; that you take the time to format
          the
          resume; check spacing and adjust any&nbsp; lines of text that
          seem out
          of place.&nbsp; Follow instructions of your potential
          employer. If the
          employer is asking&nbsp; that you send your resume in the body
          of the
          e-mail, do not send them an&nbsp; attachment. <br>
          <br>
          Copy and paste
          the plain text resume you have created into&nbsp; the body of
          the
          email; take the time to check for potential formatting&nbsp;
          changes.
          Do not try to format the text by making portions of your
          resume&nbsp;
          bold, or change the font size or type. While you may have the
          email
          editor&nbsp; which allows for this formatting, your potential
          employer
          may only accept&nbsp; plain text messages. Stick to the basics
          for a
          successful transmission of your resume.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Do Not save your
          resume as a PDF. This file type is typically larger in size,
          and&nbsp;
          is not very common for an electronic resume, that your
          potential
          employer may&nbsp; completely discard your email.&nbsp; Test
          your
          electronic resume by sending it to a few friends via email.
          Because&nbsp; they may be using different e-mail providers, or
          have
          different software than you,&nbsp; they can let you know how
          your
          resume appears to them.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          This will help
          you in&nbsp; uncovering and correcting potential formatting
          problems,
          to assure that your&nbsp; resume is in great form by the time
          it
          reaches potential employers.&nbsp; Do Not make an assumption
          that
          including a resume in the body of an email is&nbsp; the only
          information you should include in your message to your
          potential&nbsp;
          employer. Even if the resume is copied into the email, you
          still need
          to let your&nbsp; employer know a little bit more about
          yourself via a
          cover letter. <br>
          <br>
          However,
          since&nbsp; you will include your address at the top of the
          email, feel
          free to start your&nbsp; resume with a career objective
          instead of
          including the heading with your name&nbsp; and
          address.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

          <br>
          In order to seek
          out and apply for the jobs you are interested in, you will
          most likely
          post your profile and resume on a job search web site, such
          as&nbsp;
          monster.com or hotjobs.com.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          These search
          engines allow you to upload your&nbsp; resume in a Microsoft
          Word or
          text file format, or create one using their forms.&nbsp;
          Outside of the
          job search web sites, e-mailing your resume as form of&nbsp;
          application has become commonplace. However, each employer or
          headhunter&nbsp; has different rules on the file they will
          accept via
          e-mail. Most companies will&nbsp; accept an attachment in
          Microsoft
          Word – this is why you have to be conscious&nbsp; of the font
          type and size, as well as margins you are using when
          composing&nbsp;
          your resume.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If a company is
          requesting a text file, you should follow these&nbsp; steps to
          convert
          your Microsoft Word document into a text resume: Select File,
          Save
          As&nbsp; Name the file; as a best practice, use your name as
          the file
          name, and use&nbsp; underscores as spaces&nbsp; Under Format,
          select
          Text Only&nbsp; Select Save&nbsp; Now that you have converted
          your file
          to a text file, make sure to open it and&nbsp; review how the
          spaces,
          tabs, and bullet points have transferred over. You may&nbsp;
          need to do
          some edits in order to format the resume to fit the file type.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Note that&nbsp;
          the plain text file doesn’t allow for bold, italicizing or
          underlining. Make sure that&nbsp; all your text is left
          justified and
          that the spacing is correct.&nbsp; If an employer asks that
          you include
          your resume in the body of an email, treat&nbsp; this as a
          text file
          when formatting. Copy and paste your whole resume in an&nbsp;
          email.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Keep the font
          styles basic; use Arial or Times New Roman fonts and
          keep&nbsp; the
          size at 10 or 12 points. Adjust all the spacing and bullet
          points
          as&nbsp; appropriate. A good rule to follow is to keep the
          email simple
          – avoid bold or&nbsp; italicizing text since you don’t
          really know the type of email software your&nbsp; recipient is
          using or
          if the accept HTML or text emails only.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          If you are
          sending your resume as an attachment, format the body of your
          email&nbsp; as a cover letter. At the top of the email,
          include your
          name and address, as well&nbsp; as the address of your
          recipient.
          Typically, the address can be found either on&nbsp; the job
          listing or
          at the company’s web site. If you are sending the resume in
          the&nbsp; body of the email, follow the same guidelines in
          terms of the
          email content.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Don’t make
          an assumption that including a resume in the body of an email
          is
          the&nbsp; only information you should include in your message
          to your
          potential employer.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          If the resume is
          copied into the email, you still need to let your employer
          know a&nbsp;
          little bit more about yourself via a cover letter. However,
          since you
          will include&nbsp; your address at the top of the email, feel
          free to
          start your resume with a career&nbsp; objective instead of
          including
          the heading with your name and address.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Much like
          proofing is critical in perfecting your resume, testing how
          your
          resume&nbsp; is displayed in a body of an email or how it
          opens as an
          attachment via another&nbsp; computer is important. Rally your
          friends
          or family for help, and send them&nbsp; sample emails with
          your resume
          included in the body of the message or as an&nbsp; attachment.
          This
          will provide a great opportunity for you to assure that
          your&nbsp;
          resume is reaching your potential employers in the format that
          is clean
          and&nbsp; professional.<br>
          <br>
          PRINTED
          RESUMES&nbsp; As professionals, we rely on the Internet to
          search for
          jobs and on e-mail to&nbsp; apply for them. We create our
          resumes and
          cover letters to fit the electronic&nbsp; format, so it is not
          a
          surprise that having to print out a resume can result in&nbsp;
          concerns
          and mistakes.&nbsp; First, let’s discuss when a printed resume
          is
          needed.<br>
          <br>
          While you are
          completing&nbsp; numerous job applications online, you still
          need to
          have a printed resume to&nbsp; bring on an interview with you.
          You also
          must keep in mind that it is very likely&nbsp; your potential
          employer
          will print out your resume from a job search web site or&nbsp;
          from the
          message you sent expressing your interest in the job. <br>
          <br>
          Thus, it is
          very&nbsp; important that you print out a test copy before
          submitting
          your resume to&nbsp; employers to assure the layout is what
          you want it
          to be.&nbsp; As a rule, when printing out your resume, make
          sure to use
          white or ivory paper.&nbsp; You can get a stack of resume
          paper at any
          office supplies store. You will want&nbsp; your resume to
          appear as
          clean and professional. <br>
          <br>
          Do not use color
          paper, or&nbsp; change the color of the font in order to make
          your
          resume stand out; your&nbsp; employer will find this
          unprofessional and
          childish, which is not the first&nbsp; impression you want to
          make. If
          your resume is longer than one page, print out&nbsp; multiple
          pages.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Don’t
          print on the front and the back of a single page; rather,
          include
          headings in&nbsp; your resume file, indicating page numbers
          and print
          each page on its own sheet&nbsp; of paper. You should not have
          any
          handwriting on your resume; make sure that&nbsp; page numbers
          are in
          fact printed along with the rest of the resume content.&nbsp;
          <br>
          <br>
          Make sure that
          you let your resume sit on the printer for a few moments
          before&nbsp;
          picking it up. This will help you avoid smudging the ink of
          the paper,
          especially if&nbsp; you are using an Ink Jet printer. You want
          to
          assure that the resume doesn’t&nbsp; have any smudging,
          stains,
          or crumpling when you are handing it to your&nbsp; potential
          employer. <br>
          <br>
          First
          impressions are important – you don’t want yours to
          be&nbsp; that of someone who is sloppy and careless.&nbsp;
          When going
          in for an interview, you should bring multiple copies of your
          resume&nbsp; with you. Some people think this is not necessary
          because
          your potential&nbsp; employer already has your resume. This is
          a common
          misconception. You&nbsp; should always have several copies of
          your
          resume printed out and with you&nbsp; when at an
          interview.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Often times, the
          hiring manager may ask another associate to meet you
          during&nbsp; the
          interviewing process, and he/she may not have a copy of your
          resume.&nbsp; Having extras makes you look professional,
          prepared and
          organized, which&nbsp; helps you set your best foot
          forward.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, it
          is helpful that the copy of the resume you bring in for an
          interview&nbsp; has a complete list of references. You can
          include the
          references directly on&nbsp; your resume (typically at the
          bottom of
          the page), or you can include a separate&nbsp; sheet of paper
          with the
          list. <br>
          <br>
          The first option
          is preferred, because it provides the&nbsp; employer with all
          of the
          critical information about you in one place. Including&nbsp;
          your
          references preempts the employer from asking you for this
          information;
          it&nbsp; also shows that you are seriously interested in the
          available
          position.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Having a
          well-formatted, clean and professional resume will only help
          you
          make&nbsp; a great first impression, and help you get the job
          you are
          truly interested in. <br>
