          Many
          professionals spend hours writing and re-writing their cover
          letter. With&nbsp; each resume submission, we tend to revise
          our cover
          letter to make sure that it&nbsp; is personalized for the
          position we
          are applying for.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          While we spend
          so much&nbsp; time on the content of the cover letter,
          we seem to disregard a very important&nbsp; and prominent area
          of the
          letter – the address line. Most mistakes in the cover&nbsp;
          letter are made in the address line.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          This is very
          problematic as this is the first piece of information that
          the potential&nbsp; employer sees on your resume. If mistakes
          are made
          in the address line, it is&nbsp; likely that the potential
          employer
          will discard the letter and you will lose an&nbsp; opportunity
          to be
          considered as a candidate for the job that you want.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          The following
          three mistakes are most common in addressing the cover
          letter&nbsp; and should be considered before your cover letter
          is sent
          to the employer:&nbsp; Not addressing the letter to a person.
          This is a
          big mistake in the world of cover&nbsp; letters. Generic
          greetings,
          such as “To whom it may concern” or “Dear Human&nbsp;
          Resources Team,” are not favorable.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If the job
          description or posting does not&nbsp; include the contact
          person, you will need to do some research to find out
          who&nbsp; the
          appropriate contact is for the job you are applying for. <br>
          <br>
          Additionally,
          avoid&nbsp; addressing the letter to a job title.&nbsp;
          Call the organization and find out who is the hiring manager
          or the
          recruiter for&nbsp; the job, and address the letter directly
          to them.
          In case it is impossible to find out&nbsp; who the appropriate
          contact
          is, it is often recommended that you leave off any&nbsp;
          generic
          greetings and simply begin the cover letter.&nbsp; Misspelling
          the name
          of the organization. Even if you are addressing your
          cover&nbsp; letter
          to a specific person, you will still need to include the name
          of the
          company&nbsp; and their address. <br>
          <br>
          Always make sure
          that the company name is spelled&nbsp; correctly.
          Hiring managers and recruiters know from experience that
          misspelling
          the company name is a common mistake, but it’s the easiest one
          to
          avoid.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Triple-check the
          company name on your cover letter.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If your
          potential employer&nbsp; receives the letter with the
          incorrect
          company name, your letter will never make&nbsp; it past the
          first
          person who receives it.&nbsp; Your first sentence doesn’t
          explain
          why you are contacting the company. This is&nbsp; a common
          mistake as
          many people assume that stating that you are contacting&nbsp;
          the
          company regarding employment, as you are including your
          resume,
          is&nbsp; unnecessary. <br>
          <br>
          However, this is
          not the case. <br>
          <br>
          Let your
          potential employer exactly&nbsp; why you are contacting them;
          state the title of the job you are interested in, and&nbsp;
          how your
          qualifications make you an ideal candidate for the job.&nbsp;
          Your
          first statement needs to be straight forward, energetic, and
          positive,
          and it&nbsp; should invite the employer to read through the
          rest of the
          cover letter. <br>
          <br>
          Bland and&nbsp;
          generic opening statements will result in disinterest
          on the part of your employer, and your resume will not get
          pass the
          first review.&nbsp; <br>
