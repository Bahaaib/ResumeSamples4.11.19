      Welcome!<br>
      <br>
      This app contains a superb, easy to use CV Builder as well as
      valuable information about writing your CV. You are welcome to use
      as much or as little of it as you like.<br>
      <br>
      Go through the information about CVs, first. This gives you
      valuable help about how to write your CV. <br>
      <br>
      Click on the menu item called CV </font><font face="Arial"><font
        face="Arial">Builder</font> to start creating your CV. It is
      simple to use. Remember, you can download your CV to your phone or
      tablet or you can email it to yourself or anyone else.&nbsp; The
      CV should save to your Download folder. Files can sometimes be
      difficult to find on mobile devices so just email it to yourself
      if you cannot find it after downloading.<br>
      <br>
      The CV will save as a Word file (.doc) so that you can use your
      desktop computer to make it even better, if you wish. Remember to
      save it as a PDF when you have finished editing it on your desktop
      to send to employers.<br>
      <br>
      There are a selection of CV Templates in this app for you to use.
      We will be adding more - so please keep this app on your device
      and check back for updates.<br>
      <br>
      BONUS - You can now download the Resume Templates used in the
      Resume Builder as blank documents for free. See the app's Home
      Screen for details.<br>
      <br>
      This app is is in Beta mode which means we have completely

      page lower down the app.<br>
