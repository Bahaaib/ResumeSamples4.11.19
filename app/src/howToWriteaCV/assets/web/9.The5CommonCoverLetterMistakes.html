          &nbsp;<br>
          With every
          resume submission, you should have a cover letter that&nbsp;
          accompanies it and presents you as a positive and qualified
          candidate
          for the&nbsp; job.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          A cover letter
          should highlight areas of your resume which promote your&nbsp;
          professional experience, and should address any questions an
          employer
          may&nbsp; have about hiring you for the job.&nbsp; There are
          five
          common cover letter mistakes outlined below that you must
          avoid&nbsp;
          in order to get through the first round of resume review and
          move one
          step&nbsp; closer to getting the job that you want.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Addressing the
          cover letter using a generic greeting, or misspelling the name
          of&nbsp;
          the personal contact or the company.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The address line
          is the most prominent&nbsp; part of the cover letter; it
          should be
          included even if the cover letter is sent via&nbsp; email.
          Generic
          greetings are not favored; they make it seem like you have
          a&nbsp;
          template for your cover letter and you simply send it to all
          employers
          you are&nbsp; interested in working for.&nbsp; Do the research
          and find
          out who the appropriate contact is for the cover letter.&nbsp;
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          However, make
          sure that they name and the company name is spelled
          correctly.&nbsp; If
          your address line contains errors, your cover letter is likely
          to never
          make it to&nbsp; the hiring manager.&nbsp; Asking the employer
          to call
          you at their convenience.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The most generic
          closing&nbsp; statements in cover letters ask the employer to
          contact
          you at their convenience.&nbsp; If you are truly excited about
          the
          opportunity with the employer, you won’t want&nbsp; to wait
          for
          them to call you back whenever they feel like it.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          What you should
          do instead is let them know when you want to follow up – and
          then
          do follow up.&nbsp; Close your cover letter by letting your
          potential
          employer know that you will&nbsp; contact them, as well as the
          manner
          in which you will do so.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          This shows
          your&nbsp; interest, and your take-charge attitude.&nbsp;
          Telling the
          company what they can do for your career. Simply stated,
          employers&nbsp; care about your qualifications and what you
          can do for
          the company. Do not&nbsp; spend your time telling the company
          how
          working for them can be great for your&nbsp; career. While
          that could
          be true, it certainly is not what the employers want to&nbsp;
          hear.
          Your potential employers want to hear how you can benefit
          their team;
          they&nbsp; want to know what you can bring to the table that
          is
          innovative, and focused on&nbsp; results. <br>
          <br>
          Make sure that
          your resume lets your employer know just why you are&nbsp; the
          best
          candidate for the job.&nbsp; You re-state your resume. Do not
          go over
          the information that is in your resume&nbsp; in your cover
          letter. Your
          cover letter is meant to entice, and provoke the&nbsp;
          employer to
          review your resume in great detail. <br>
          <br>
          Re-stating the
          information in&nbsp; your resume doesn’t address what the
          employers want to know, which concerns&nbsp; reasons why you
          are the
          best candidate for the job. Highlight certain areas of&nbsp;
          your
          resume but do so in the context of your career goals and how
          such&nbsp;
          qualifications benefit the company.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Starting every
          sentence with “I”. While your cover letter is about you,
          starting&nbsp; each sentence this way will make your employer
          believe
          that your&nbsp; communication skills are not up to the level
          of your
          professional background.&nbsp; Discuss your qualifications,
          your goals
          and what you bring to the table in terms&nbsp; of the company,
          and your
          professional attributes.&nbsp; <br>

          &nbsp;<br>
          Listing your
          professional experiences on your resume is a difficult task.
          There&nbsp; are so many elements to consider: job titles, time
          frames,
          key responsibilities,&nbsp; transferable skills, etc.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The process
          becomes even more difficult if you have&nbsp; gaps in your
          work
          history. Your potential employer will not have a way of&nbsp;
          knowing
          why there is a three and a half year gap in your
          professional&nbsp;
          experience just by reviewing your resume, for example.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The employer may
          wonder if you skipped over one of the jobs you held
          because&nbsp; it
          doesn’t meet your career objective, or they may assume that
          you
          didn’t work&nbsp; at all during the time frame that is
          unaccounted for on your resume. Any gaps in&nbsp; your
          employment
          history will need to be explained in writing; thus, don’t skip
          any&nbsp; information on purpose.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          There are a few
          general rules about resume gaps:&nbsp; Any unaccounted time
          that is
          shorter than three months doesn’t need to&nbsp; be explained.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Having 60-90
          days in between jobs is not too unusual, and&nbsp; often goes
          unnoticed
          within a resume. However, any gaps extending&nbsp; beyond
          three months
          should be addressed in your cover letter or e-mail.&nbsp;
          Whether you
          had personal or professional reasons for not working,
          the&nbsp; gaps in
          your employment history need to be explained as you don’t
          want&nbsp; to leave the employer to make their own
          assumptions. <br>
          <br>
          Be honest! <br>
          <br>
          We can’t
          stress this matter enough. If you are honest with your&nbsp;
          potential
          employer, you will not have to worry about them checking
          your&nbsp;
          references, doing a background check, or surprising you with
          questions
          in&nbsp; an interview.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Don’t
          exclude months of your employment from the job listing. You
          are&nbsp;
          better off explaining the gaps in your resume than trying to
          cover them
          up.&nbsp; Honesty is really the best policy when it comes to
          your
          resume. <br>
          <br>
          If you have held
          jobs that are not applicable to your career objective,
          list&nbsp; them
          on your resume anyway. Rather than create gaps in your
          resume,&nbsp;
          explain why you held jobs outside of your field in your cover
          letter or
          in an&nbsp; email to your potential employer.<br>
          <br>
          Again, whether
          the reasons are personal&nbsp; or professional, explain
          yourself
          honestly and don’t leave room for&nbsp; assumptions on the
          part
          of your potential employer.&nbsp; Regardless of the reasons
          for the
          gaps in your professional history, it is&nbsp; important that
          the tone
          in your cover letter and your resume remains positive.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Do not sound
          apologetic – life happens and you don’t need to be sorry
          for taking&nbsp; time off of work. Be positive, and show your
          potential
          employer that you never&nbsp; lost focus on your career.&nbsp;
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          While we all
          agree that life takes unexpected turns and respect that there
          will
          be&nbsp; circumstances that create gaps in our resumes, we can
          always
          consider the&nbsp; following actions in order to stay
          competitive
          within our field: Apply your time and experience to volunteer
          positions, community&nbsp; projects, and consulting or
          freelance work.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Take a class at
          a community college or at the community center that&nbsp;
          improves your
          work-related skills and allows you to interact with
          people&nbsp; with
          similar professional backgrounds.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Read about the
          new developments in your field. Get a subscription to a&nbsp;
          professional publication/magazine, or get the newly published
          books
          that&nbsp; discuss changes or improvements in your
          profession.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Most of all, be
          honest and stay positive. You can’t change your work&nbsp;
          history, so do your best to show your employer you are a
          perfect
          candidate&nbsp; for the job by focusing on your experience and
          your
          education, highlighting&nbsp; your achievements and your
          qualifications.<br>
