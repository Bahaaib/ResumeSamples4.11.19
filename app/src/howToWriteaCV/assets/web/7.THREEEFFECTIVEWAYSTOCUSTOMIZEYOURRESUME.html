              EFFECTIVE WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR RESUME&nbsp; </span></font></big></big><br>

          &nbsp; <br>
          While most
          resumes appear to look the same on the surface, there are
          key&nbsp;
          areas that differentiate well-written winning resumes from
          those that
          never make&nbsp; it into the hands of the hiring managers. To
          customize
          your resume for the job&nbsp; that you want, pay attention to
          the
          following three elements: resume style,&nbsp; career
          objective, and
          personal profile.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          The layout and
          the style of your resume are as important as the information
          you&nbsp;
          are including about your experience and qualifications.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The two most
          commonly&nbsp; used resume styles are chronological and
          functional.
          Chronological resume calls&nbsp; for listing your professional
          expertise in order, much like the name implies, and is used
          those with
          some to extensive professional experience. <br>
          <br>
          Functional&nbsp;
          resume showcases your experience by the type of qualifications
          you
          have, and&nbsp; is typically used by those lacking
          professional
          experience or those changing&nbsp; careers.&nbsp; While there
          are no
          set rules on determining the best resume style to use, it
          is&nbsp;
          important to keep in mind that the resume format can help or
          hurt your
          chances&nbsp; to put your best foot forward. <br>
          <br>
          You will want to
          pick the format that will best&nbsp; highlight your
          qualifications and
          your experience. Thus, it is important to&nbsp; understand the
          difference between the two, as well as research which format
          is&nbsp;
          more preferred in the field of your choice.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Career objective
          is very important to your resume. While there is an
          ongoing&nbsp;
          debate about the need for listing your objective on your
          resume,
          choosing to&nbsp; include this goal statement shows that you
          have given
          your professional growth&nbsp; some serious thought. Consider
          your
          career objective as the first impression you&nbsp; make on
          your
          potential employer. <br>
          <br>
          Make sure that
          your goals are specific and&nbsp; directional in terms of
          industry,
          position title, and future professional&nbsp;
          achievements.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Many people make
          a mistake of including generic statements under their
          career&nbsp;
          objective. To be effective, your statement must tell a
          potential
          employer that you&nbsp; know what kind of job you want, what
          experience
          you have in order to get the&nbsp; position, and what you are
          willing
          do to become a successful professional with&nbsp; the
          company.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          While your
          career objective tells your potential employer why you are
          applying&nbsp; for the job at their organization, your
          professional
          profile sells your expertise and&nbsp; convinces the employer
          that you
          are the best candidate for the job. Your&nbsp; professional
          summary/profile gives you the opportunity to differentiate
          yourself,&nbsp; and give your employer an insight into
          you.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Two commonly
          made mistakes for this section of the resume are poor
          writing&nbsp; and
          inclusion of personal information. Note that your age,
          ethnicity,
          gender,&nbsp; religious affiliations, etc. do not make a
          difference on
          how you handle yourself&nbsp; as a business professional. Such
          information should never be included in a&nbsp; resume, or any
          job
          application materials (even when asked on a job
          application,&nbsp; such
          information is optional and is for demographics study
          only).&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Make sure this
          section is well written and error-free. Strong positive
          statements&nbsp; about your expertise will give a good first
          impression
          to your employer. Make&nbsp; sure to proofread the whole
          resume, with
          emphasis to this section, as it appears&nbsp; at the start of
          your
          resume. An effective personal statement must leave your&nbsp;
          employer
          with an impression that you are confident, credible, and
          professional.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Keep in mind
          – your resume is your sales pitch, demonstrating your&nbsp;
          qualifications and experience to your potential employer.
          Seize the
          opportunity&nbsp; to put your best foot forward and you will
          reap the
          rewards.<br>

            <b>HOW TO AVOID THE
              TOP FIVE COMMON RESUME MISTAKES&nbsp; </b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
          &nbsp; <br>
          If you have ever
          tried to write a resume, for yourself or for someone you
          know,&nbsp;
          you are already familiar with the fact that this is not an
          easy task to
          take on. So&nbsp; much information goes into a resume; from
          your career
          objective to the list of&nbsp; your qualifications, your
          resume should
          be personal, convey confidence and set&nbsp; your best foot
          forward in
          order to impress a potential employer. However,&nbsp; creating
          a
          winning resume is not easy.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          The following
          are the most commonly made mistakes in resume
          composition:&nbsp;
          Including references to personal web sites.&nbsp; You may
          wonder why
          referencing a personal web site may be a mistake. What
          if&nbsp; you
          have a sample of your graphic design work on your site that
          you want
          your&nbsp; potential employer to see?<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          It sounds like a
          great idea, if the site you are&nbsp; referencing only has
          work-related
          information available. Many people make a&nbsp; mistake of
          including
          their personal web sites that may contain information&nbsp;
          potential
          employers may find irrelevant (and now you are wasting their
          time) or
          inappropriate.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          As a rule, do
          not include your personal web site if it contains your photo
          or
          other&nbsp; photos that may be viewed as inappropriate, if it
          contains
          jokes (even if they are&nbsp; clean jokes), or your blog. In
          other
          words, if the site you have is entirely for&nbsp; personal
          purposes,
          you are best leaving it off your resume.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Include a link
          to your web site if the pages are set up to showcase
          your&nbsp;
          professional portfolio, a copy of your resume, reference
          letters,
          presentations,&nbsp; photos taken for professional use, or
          your web
          development skills.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Using very small
          fonts in order to get everything to fit on one page.&nbsp; One
          of the
          most common challenges is creating a resume that formats well
          on
          a&nbsp; single page. As a rule, a resume should not exceed two
          pages.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          However,
          in&nbsp; recent years, it has become commonplace for
          professionals to
          change jobs&nbsp; frequently, and listing all the experiences,
          in
          addition to your career objective,&nbsp; education,
          qualifications and
          references, can certainly take up a lot of space.&nbsp; Do not
          use a
          small font in order to fit everything into your resume. There
          is not
          a&nbsp; single area in your resume that should have a font
          size of less
          than 10 points.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Keep in mind the
          font type you are using – stick to the basics, Arial and
          Times&nbsp; New Roman are your best bet. Instead of changing
          the font
          size, review and&nbsp; revise your resume to make your
          statements more
          concise.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Incorrect
          company/school listings.&nbsp; The biggest mistake people
          make, without
          realizing that they are making it, is&nbsp; not referring to
          the past
          employers and/or the school(s) they’ve attended by their&nbsp;
          full names.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Do not use
          variations of company and school names. Don’t use&nbsp;
          abbreviations unless they are in fact part of the name. If you
          have
          attended New&nbsp; York University, list the complete name,
          not just
          NYU (even though it’s&nbsp; commonly known and your employer
          will
          likely recognize it). You don’t want to&nbsp; appear sloppy or
          as
          if you don’t pay attention to details.&nbsp; Lengthy
          paragraphs
          describing your experiences.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          To list the
          responsibilities you’ve had in your past professional
          experience,
          you&nbsp; are best off using bullet points that begin with
          action
          verbs, such as managed,&nbsp; developed, etc. You do not need
          to use
          full sentences, and you certainly do not&nbsp; need to use the
          paragraph format. This makes the information in your
          resume&nbsp;
          overwhelming and difficult to review quickly. Make your
          statements
          brief and&nbsp; clear; don’t add words to fill in space.&nbsp;
          <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Typos.&nbsp; The
          most important factor in achieving a winning resume is proof
          reading.
          You&nbsp; want to put your best foot forward. If your resume
          contains
          grammar and&nbsp; spelling problems, your potential employer
          will get
          an impression that you are&nbsp; not detail-oriented. It is
          hard to
          proof a document you have been working on so&nbsp; closely –
          use
          spell check (but be ware, it will not catch everything), ask
          your&nbsp;
          friends for help, meet with a career counselor.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Do your best to
          present the most&nbsp; polished resume to your potential
          employers.<br>

          &nbsp; <br>
          Having a
          well-formatted resume is almost as important as having a well
          written&nbsp; resume. Most employers receive a stack of
          resumes of
          qualified candidates and&nbsp; scan them quickly before they
          decide
          whether or not hey want to read further. In&nbsp; addition to
          key
          words, what stands out the most about your resume is its
          format.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          It is
          essentially the first thing people will notice, whether on
          paper or in
          electronic&nbsp; form.&nbsp; There are a number of rules you
          should
          keep in mind when formatting your&nbsp; resume. First, start
          with a
          blank page.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Avoid using
          templates that are already&nbsp; available in Microsoft Word.
          These
          templates are outdated, and they will make&nbsp; your resume
          appear
          generic and uninviting. Additionally, these templates,
          while&nbsp; well
          formatted in Microsoft Word, will not translate well when
          emailed
          or&nbsp; uploaded to job search engine web sites.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          You can find
          samples of resumes on the Internet; search for resumes by
          your&nbsp;
          industry to find the templates that make most sense for the
          job you are
          seeking.&nbsp; Than work on a blank page to replicate the look
          and feel
          of the resume you like.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Ideally, your
          resume should fit on one page; if you have extensive
          experience,&nbsp;
          limit the length of the resume to two pages, but only list
          experiences
          and skills&nbsp; relevant to your career objective. Even if
          you are
          applying for a job in a creative&nbsp; field, do not insert
          images or
          pictures into your resume. If you are looking to&nbsp; show
          off your
          creativity, you can do so in a separate portfolio of your
          work.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          The page should
          have one inch margins, top and bottom, right and left. Use
          left&nbsp;
          justification only – as a rule, do not center the content of
          your
          resume. The font&nbsp; and font size should be consistent.
          Your name,
          and any headlines in your&nbsp; resume should be displayed in
          the same
          manner. Typically, the headlines will be&nbsp; in all caps,
          and in
          bold.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Try not to
          underline any of the information in your resume. In the world
          of&nbsp;
          Internet driven job applications, underlining in a document
          implies a
          web link.&nbsp; Thus, using underlining for emphasis is not
          appropriate.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The font size
          for&nbsp; headlines should not exceed 14 points; the remainder
          of the
          text in the resume&nbsp; should not exceed 12 points.&nbsp;
          When trying
          to align your resume, be ware of spacing and tabbing.
          Stay&nbsp;
          consistent in the way that you are spacing out the information
          on the
          page. <br>
          <br>
          Use&nbsp; tabs,
          rather than spaces. You always have to anticipate that the
          person you
          are&nbsp; sending your resume to may have a different version
          of the
          software than you&nbsp; and thus may not see the exactly the
          same
          resume you are sending – it is&nbsp; possible that the margins
          will reset, paragraphs will shift, bullet points will&nbsp;
          change
          shape, etc.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          This is why you
          must keep the spacing consistent, as well as&nbsp; try to keep
          the font
          and the bullet points as basic as possible.&nbsp; As a last
          formatting
          check point, ask your friends or your family for help in&nbsp;
          reviewing your resume.<br>
          <br>
          Send the resume
          file via email to a few of your friends –&nbsp; ask them to
          review the resume and make sure nothing seems out of place.
          Print&nbsp;
          out the resume on paper and review to make sure that margins
          are
          accurately&nbsp; set, and that the content doesn’t appear
          crowded
          on the page.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Keep in mind
          –&nbsp; when it comes to your resume, sleek simple appearance,
          and great writing, will&nbsp; get you the job you are looking
          for.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
