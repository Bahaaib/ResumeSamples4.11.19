              To Format Resume Headings And What Should Be Included </span></big></big></font><br>

    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big><big>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The first and
          most prominent item on your resume if your name and contact
          information. Your name is typically in the largest font,
          standing apart
          from all other text on your resume. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          A common mistake
          professionals make is trying to emphasize their name in a
          special font
          type. As it is difficult to anticipate the software and its
          version
          your potential employer is using, you run a risk of not
          knowing exactly
          how your name will show up on their screen. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Stick to the
          basic font types – Arial and Times New Roman are most commonly
          used and are least risky when it comes to formatting your
          resume.
          Don’t go overboard on the font size either. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Your name should
          be in point size 14 or 16; all other headings should be in 12
          or 14
          point font, while the remaining text of your resume should be
          between
          10 and 12 points. Along with your name, the very top of your
          resume
          should contain your mailing address, your email address, and
          at least
          one phone number where you can be reached. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          It is best to
          include a physical mailing address over a P.O. Box, whenever
          possible.
          You should never include an email address at your current
          place of
          employment (believe us, it happens). A helpful hint about
          listing your
          email address – make sure that it contains your name, as this
          helps you appear more professional. You can create a free
          Yahoo email
          account; it also maybe helpful to have one email address as a
          point of
          contact for your job search. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          At least one
          phone number should be listed; make sure to indicate if you
          are listing
          a home or a mobile number. If you have a professional web
          site, you can
          include the address to it along with your contact information.
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Please note,
          only do so if there isn’t anything on the web site that is
          personal; the only reason your potential employer may want to
          look at a
          web site is if your professional portfolio or a copy of your
          resume can
          be found there. Whether you decide to create a chronological
          or a
          functional resume, you will need to separate the information
          by
          headings. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The best advice
          we can give you is to keep the section headings professional
          and stick
          to the basics. Don’t try to come up with creative titles for
          your
          professional summary, or for your qualifications. Your
          chronological
          resume should have the following sections/titles: <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <b>Career </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>

          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Professional </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Summary
          </b>(optional)<br>
          Professional
          Experience/work experience/experience Education
          Publications/Special
          Achievements (if applicable)<br>
          <br>
          <b>Qualifications/Skills
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>

          and<b> Portfolio </b><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          A functional
          resume is slightly different, and the headings you chose will
          truly
          depend on the skills you are trying to highlight. You should
          include:<br>
          <br>
          <b>Career </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Objective </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Education </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Professional
            Skills Professional Qualifications </b>(this section will
          include
          sub-headings as they relate to specific qualifications you
          want to
          promote, such as communications, customer relations,
          managements, etc.)<br>
          <br>
          <b>Work Experience </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Work History </b>(if
          applicable; should only include dates, titles, companies and
          locations
          without listing responsibilities)<br>
          <br>
          <b>Volunteer
            Work/Activities </b>(if applicable)<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>References </b><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          These are the
          typical sections of chronological and functional resumes. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Do some research
          on resume styles and find sample resumes of professionals in
          your
          industry. You may need to adjust these headings based on your
          field,
          although the content should be consistent across industries. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Stick to the
          basics; don’t try to be creative in order to stand out. A
          professional and polished resume will get you noticed, so do
          your best
          to create a resume that is error free and best supports your
          career
          objective. <br>

          &nbsp;<br>
          Keep It Short
          One of the main questions asked about resumes is, “Do I have
          to
          include everything on one page?” The most common misconception
          of
          resume writing is that your entire professional history has to
          fit
          within one 8 ½”x11” page of white paper. The truth
          is, the resume should be well written and concise, and should
          promote
          your qualifications in the best possible light. This is
          sometimes
          impossible to do in one page. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Thus, a resume
          can extend to multiple pages, with some consideration
          depending on your
          career level. Be concise. This is critical. Do not use lengthy
          sentences and paragraph forms to disclose your experience and
          your
          education. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Employers want
          straight forward statements that highlight your
          qualifications. A
          resume is not a place to show your creative writing skills.
          Perfect
          your resume. You have second to catch your potential
          employer’s
          attention. Make sure that your resume is properly formatted,
          and you
          are not trying to fit too much copy on a single page of paper.
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Create
          appropriate and professional sections for your resume. Your
          potential
          employer is more concerned with the look and content of your
          resume
          than with its length. Longer is not better when you don’t have
          the experience to meet your career objective. If you are new
          to the job
          market, are changing careers, or you’ve only had one job,
          stick
          to a one page resume. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If you
          don’t have the experience to meet your career objective, no
          matter the reason, do not apologize for it.<br>
          Don’t try
          to fill up your resume with irrelevant content; instead do
          your best to
          highlight your transferable skills, and stick to the “short
          and
          sweet.” Unless you are applying for an executive-level job, or
          are composing curriculum vitae, your resume should not exceed
          two
          pages. The purpose of a well-written resume is to sell you as
          the best
          candidate for the job with a confident and a straight-forward
          approach.
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Do not oversell
          your skills. Do not list more than three to five previous
          positions
          you’ve help. Stick to those skills and experiences that best
          meet
          the job requirements and your career objective. The most
          relevant
          information has to be included on the first page. The second
          page
          should be numbered, with your contact information included as
          well
          (just in case the pages are separated when printed, you don’t
          want your potential employer to discard the second page of
          your resume
          completely). <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If you find
          yourself going over two pages, review your resume and make
          sure that
          you are not incorporating information that is irrelevant to
          your goals
          or to the position you are seeking. Make sure that your
          professional
          history warrants a resume that is three pages or longer. As
          mentioned
          above, unless you are a senior-or executive-level
          professional, or you
          are composing curriculum vitae, your resume should not extend
          to over
          two pages.<br>
          If you have a
          longer resume, you will have to make sure that every statement
          on the
          resume is applicable to your career goals. If you have had
          decades of
          leadership experience for example, demonstrate that using the
          reverse
          chronological resume style and only list those jobs that best
          qualify
          you for the position you are seeking. If you need to include
          an
          extensive list of publications or certifications, your resume
          can take
          up more than three pages. Make sure that the important
          information is
          still listed on the first page. This includes your career
          objective and
          professional profile, and your current or most recent
          professional
          experience. All subsequent pages need to be numbered, and
          include your
          contact information in the heading.<br>
          <br>

    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big><big>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The most
          difficult and time consuming section of any resume is the
          listing of
          your work experience, no matter the level you have reached in
          your
          professional career. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If you have just
          graduated college and don’t have any full-time professional
          experience, you are concerned if your part time job and summer
          internship are enough to get your foot in the door. If you are
          a
          seasoned professional with extensive work experience, you are
          worried
          how to fit all of your hard work on only one page.<br>
          <br>
          If you are
          changing careers, you are unsure which skills best showcase
          your
          qualifications. Listing work responsibilities on our resumes
          doesn’t get easier as our career progresses. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The key is to
          consider your career objective and prioritize your work in
          accordance
          to your goals. When people are asked about work
          responsibilities, they
          have a tendency to disclose the routine items first. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          This method can
          be a costly mistake for listing your professional experiences
          on your
          resume because it leaves all of the important and key
          qualifications at
          the bottom of the list. To avoid falling into this practice,
          first put
          together a list of your responsibilities on a sheet of paper.
          For your
          initial draft, don’t worry about how you are phrasing each
          statement – just make a list of everything that you do in your
          current or have done in your previous jobs. Once your list is
          completed, consider all of the responsibilities you have
          included. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          What are the
          three most important items on the list for each job? How do
          those items
          relate to your career objective? Are there any other
          responsibilities
          you have listed that better support your career objective than
          the
          three you picked as the most critical to your job? You have to
          consider
          all these questions in order to prioritize your job
          descriptions on
          your resume. Begin each description with a power word, such as
          managed,
          developed, communicated, etc. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Make sure that
          the statements you list first quantify your achievements –
          don’t be afraid to list sales figured, customer acquisition
          rates, budget and time line successes, or any other figures
          which help
          put your responsibilities in a context of the business/field
          you are
          working in. Also, these statements should be aligned with your
          career
          objective. If you want to get a job in project management,
          letting your
          employer know that you managed a team of 20 people will
          effectively
          highlight your qualifications. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          It is important
          to quantify your job description statements on your resume;
          however, as
          a word of caution, do not quantify all statements, just one or
          two that
          are most critical to your job and are goal driven. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          This shows your
          employer that you think in terms of exceeding your goals. All
          subsequent descriptions of your responsibilities should
          support the
          first one or two items on your list. Prioritizing doesn’t only
          apply to your job descriptions, although it is the most
          commonly
          disregarded element in this particular area of the resume. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Achievements and
          qualifications are often misrepresented because they are not
          ordered
          properly. Same rules apply – consider which of your
          achievements
          and your qualifications are most complimentary to your career
          objective, and list them first. For example, if you are
          applying for a
          job in customer service, list your communication skills before
          your
          computer skills. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          While both are
          important, your communication skills are more in line with
          your career
          objective, and therefore should take priority. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          As a final test,
          put yourself in the shoes of your employer. Cross-check the
          job
          description and make sure that you address the qualifications
          required
          for the job with the information on your resume. Let your
          potential
          employer know you have what they are looking for, and you’ll
          be
          sure to make a great impression. <br>
