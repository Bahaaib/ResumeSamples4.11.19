          People think of
          their resume as a collective of their education, skills and
          professional experience. Many employers rely on resumes as
          form of job
          applications for the open positions within their
          organizations. Thus it
          is very important that you have a well-written resume prepared
          when
          searching for jobs.<br>
          <br>
          Creating a
          resume is not an easy task, even if you are a professional
          with years
          of experience and many skills. However, composing a resume
          when you are
          looking to completely change careers, or when you are fresh
          out of
          school is much more difficult, because you do not have any
          experience
          to highlight. If you are changing careers, and nothing from
          your past
          professional experience qualifies you for the new job you are
          seeking,
          highlight those qualifications that can be transitioned along
          the
          various industries. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          For example, if
          you’ve managed people, no matter the type of business, you
          should
          highlight this under your experience. Rather than not
          highlighting your
          professional experience, even if it is not directly related to
          the job
          you are seeking, you should consider writing a professional
          profile, or
          summary at the start of your resume.<br>
          <br>
          The summary will
          allow you to address the career change by highlighting your
          skills and
          how they relate to your career objective. <br>
          <br>
          In addition,
          this is one situation where it is OK to reference any
          volunteer or
          community service work that you have done if it can help
          promote your
          qualifications for the job. If you are fresh out of college,
          and
          don’t have much to bring to the table in terms of full time
          professional experience, don’t get discouraged in creating
          your
          resume. Focus on highlighting your skills and your education.
          Avoid
          using a professional profile, or summary. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Rather, list
          your career objective and start the resume by listing your
          education.
          Make sure to mention any awards or honors you received while
          in school.
          Following your education, list all the skills that will
          qualify you for
          the job you are seeking. Make sure to mention any courses,
          such as
          project management or business communication that you have
          taken and
          can apply at work. Instead of listing any experience, title
          the section
          “Previous professional Experience” and divide it into
          categories applicable to your career objective. For example,
          instead of
          say that you spent a summer working at the Gap, use a
          sub-heading of
          “Customer Relations” and list any responsibilities where
          you have provided customer service. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Tap into any
          community service, volunteer, or school club positions you
          have held in
          order to highlight your abilities and showcase that you are
          the best
          candidate for the job. Don’t be afraid of not having the right
          experience, or not having any professional experience to
          include in a
          resume. Focus on what you can do rather than what you don’t
          have
          the experience in doing and you will have a winning resume.<br>

          <br>
          One of the
          biggest concerns in creating a resume has to do with your
          professional
          experience. Before you begin your resume, consider the
          following
          questions: What is your career objective? Are you changing
          careers or
          looking for professional growth? What experience have you had
          so far
          that will help in meeting your professional goals? <br>
          <br>
          To get started
          in developing your resume, list all of your previous
          experience, in
          chronological order, starting with your latest job on a piece
          of paper.
          List the dates of employment, your job title, the full company
          name and
          the location of your employment. Now, consider just how much
          experience
          you have had. In recent years, it has become more commonplace
          to change
          jobs more frequently and not build your career in one place. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          As such, it is
          possible that someone with ten years of professional
          experience
          following college has had over three jobs. That doesn’t seem
          all
          that much to include on a resume, right? Consider someone with
          over 30
          years of experience. It is important to set limits on what you
          include
          and what you can freely exclude from your resume under your
          professional experience. Ideally, your resume should not
          exceed two
          pages.<br>
          <br>
          Depending on the
          type of jobs you have held and your responsibilities, having
          only two
          pages doesn’t account for a lot of space. The best practice
          for
          listing your experiences is not to exceed the most recent five
          jobs you
          have held. Again, keep the mind the length of the resume when
          you are
          deciding on the number of jobs you will list – if your last
          five
          jobs and their accompanying responsibilities will take over
          one page
          alone, than consider narrowing the experience down to the
          three most
          recent positions you had. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Also, consider
          the time you spent at each organization you have worked for –
          list up to the last ten to fifteen years of experience. It is
          not
          necessary to list every job you’ve ever had to showcase your
          qualifications and years of experience. If you have a long
          professional
          career, focus on the last three to five jobs, but use the
          profile or
          summary at the beginning of the resume to highlight the number
          of years
          you have spent working, or the number of years you have spent
          in a
          certain industry, acquiring specific skills. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          When listing
          your experiences, it is important that you do so in
          chronological order
          without skipping any of the jobs you have held. While you may
          feel that
          certain jobs are not particularly complimenting to your
          current career
          objective you should not avoid listing them on your resume.
          Work on
          highlighting the responsibilities that are transferable across
          various
          industries. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Leaving any
          unexplained gaps in your work history will raise questions by
          your
          potential employer – thus don’t create those gaps on your
          resume by listing your experience out of order or by skipping
          jobs you
          have had.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, make
          sure that your cover letter accounts for any additional
          qualifications
          you would like to bring to the attention of your potential
          employer
          that you didn’t include on the resume. Your resume should be
          concise, well written, and sell you as the best candidate for
          the job.
          Just remember that it is quality over quantity that counts. <br>
