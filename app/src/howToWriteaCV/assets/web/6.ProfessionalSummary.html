          &nbsp; <br>
          In today’s
          competitive job market, employers relay on well-written
          resumes
          to&nbsp; screen potential candidates. In many instances,
          employers look
          through job&nbsp; search web sites, such as HotJobs.com or
          Monster.com,
          to find professionals&nbsp; with skills, education and
          experience that
          fit their needs. These employment&nbsp; search web sites,
          along with
          many companies’ own online applications, require&nbsp;
          candidates
          to upload their resume in order to express interest in a
          specific&nbsp;
          opportunity.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Without an
          opportunity to send a personal email, or a cover letter, you
          have
          to&nbsp; make sure that your resume expresses your personality
          in
          addition to listing&nbsp; your professional and educational
          experiences
          and achievements. To do so, you&nbsp; can include a
          professional
          profile or summary at the beginning of your resume&nbsp; that
          allows
          you to market yourself through a narrative. This section
          allows your&nbsp; potential employers to learn something
          unique about
          you and your career, as&nbsp; well as get a good feel of your
          communication skills.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          To write an
          effective summary, you should first understand what
          information&nbsp;
          should not be communicated in your resume. While a summary
          provides
          an&nbsp; insight into what is unique and competitive about
          you, it is
          not a place for you to&nbsp; indicate any personal information
          that
          does not relate to your career. Information&nbsp; such as
          ethnicity,
          marital status, sexual orientation, religious beliefs
          and&nbsp;
          affiliations, etc. should be left out of your resume.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          While
          descriptive of who you are, this information is not relevant
          to
          your&nbsp; potential employer in order to previous screen your
          qualifications for their&nbsp; opportunity. Additionally, the
          summary
          should not contain your previous&nbsp; professional
          experience, unless
          you can clearly demonstrate how such&nbsp; background can be
          of value
          in your future career development.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Beware of
          generic statements, such as “I am well organized and detail
          oriented.”&nbsp; Employers want to hear your unique voice and
          get
          a sense of your&nbsp; communication skills while reading the
          summary
          portion of your resume. <br>
          <br>
          Using&nbsp;
          generalizations about your abilities will make the employers
          believe
          that you are&nbsp; either a poor communicator or are using
          such
          statements to fill up space on your&nbsp; resume.&nbsp; Your
          summary
          should be in form of a short paragraph or bullet
          statements,&nbsp;
          containing only several sentences. There isn’t a sentence
          limit,
          but as a rule do&nbsp; not take up more than one quarter of
          the page. <br>
          <br>
          Your summary
          should begin by a&nbsp; headline that summarizes your
          professional
          title and/or your professional&nbsp; statement. Emphasize your
          title by
          featuring the headline in bold and larger font,&nbsp; as it
          allows your
          potential employer to grasp who you are quickly. For
          example:&nbsp;
          Financial Planning Professional&nbsp; Achieved Double-Digit
          Return for
          All Clients through Well-Balanced Financial&nbsp; Portfolios.
          <br>
          <br>
          It is important
          that this title is well crafted, as it is the first impression
          your&nbsp; potential employer will have of you.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          There are three
          things a well-written summary should address:&nbsp; Your
          experiences
          and skills as they relate to your idea job.&nbsp; What you can
          bring to
          the organization and the open position that no other&nbsp;
          candidate
          can.&nbsp; Your professional goals.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Even though your
          resume summary is written by you, it should be composed
          in&nbsp; third
          person, in present tense. <br>
          <br>
          Think of it as a
          summary of what one of your best&nbsp; colleagues would say
          about your
          professional achievements. Reinforce your&nbsp; title, and
          sell only
          the experiences and skills that meet your career objective.
          If&nbsp;
          you have multiple career objectives, such as you wish to get a
          position
          in either&nbsp; marketing or public relations, develop
          separate resume
          summaries for each of&nbsp; the objectives.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          A summary can
          also contain a brief bullet section highlighting only a few
          vital&nbsp;
          competitive skills that you bring to the table. An example of
          an
          effective&nbsp; summary would be as follows:&nbsp; Successful
          financial
          planning professional with over 15 years of personal and&nbsp;
          retirement planning experience. Managed a small financial
          planning
          firm, achieving double-digit financial returns for all clients
          by
          developing personalized&nbsp; investment portfolios.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Leader in
          development and professional growth of four&nbsp; other
          financial
          planners in the firm through effective and motivating
          mentoring&nbsp;
          strategies.&nbsp; Key competencies include:&nbsp; Personalized
          portfolio development&nbsp; Financial forecasting&nbsp;
          Retirement
          portfolio management&nbsp; Development on-going professional
          growth
          strategies&nbsp; Much like your overall resume, your summary
          should be
          well-written and error- free. <br>
          <br>
          Make sure to
          review your summary, and customize as necessary for the&nbsp;
          various
          opportunities of interest. An effective summary will help you
          “hook” your&nbsp; employer; it should sell you as a primary
          candidate for the job, leaving your&nbsp; employer with a
          great first
          impression of you.&nbsp; <br>

          When applying
          for jobs, it is important that you read through the job
          description&nbsp; thoroughly before submitting your
          application. A lot
          of what employers are&nbsp; actually looking for in their
          potential
          associate is written right in the job&nbsp; description and
          requirements. In fact, you should review your resume
          against&nbsp; the
          requirements listed in order to make sure you have covered
          everything
          the&nbsp; employer is looking for.<br>
          <br>
          If you can
          address all the requirements by the&nbsp; information in your
          resume or
          in your cover letter, you will be on the right track&nbsp; for
          getting
          the job.&nbsp; However, there is a whole list of skills
          employers look
          for that are never spelled&nbsp; out in the job description. <br>
          <br>
          These skills are
          typically referred to as employee&nbsp; ability skills, which
          are
          skills beyond your technical knowledge and
          qualifications&nbsp; that
          make you a great professional in your field. Don’t panic, you
          already have&nbsp; employee ability skills, you just may not
          think of
          them as critical for getting a job.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          The employee
          ability skills have been grouped in eight categories:&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          <b>Communication
            skills </b><b><br>
          </b><b>

          </b><b>&nbsp; </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Initiative and
            enterprise skills&nbsp; </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp; </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Planning and
            organizing skills&nbsp; </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp; </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Self-management&nbsp;
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp; </b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Learning skills</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>&nbsp;</b><b><br>
          </b><b>
          </b><b>Technology
            skills&nbsp; </b><br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Now that you
          have read the categories, you are thinking to yourself, yes, I
          have&nbsp; those skills. But did you ever think to list them
          on the
          resume? Most people&nbsp; focus on their professional
          achievements and
          responsibilities, and they often&nbsp; skip these skills in
          favor of
          those that are job specific. However, more and more&nbsp;
          employers
          look for these skills in resumes.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Your potential
          employer wants to know that you are a team player, that
          you&nbsp;
          communicate well, and will show initiative when needed.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          While you may
          think&nbsp; this is implied by your interest in the available
          position,
          employers like to see&nbsp; these skills called out on your
          resume or
          cover letter.&nbsp; The best way to demonstrate these skills
          is through
          your experience and under&nbsp; your qualifications. Point out
          the
          initiatives you have participated in that required&nbsp; you
          to work in
          a team, under a deadline, or as a self-starter. <br>
          <br>
          Demonstrate
          your&nbsp; loyalty through pointing out your accomplishments
          at an
          organization and how&nbsp; they benefited your team as a whole
          (not
          just you).&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          You can showcase
          the employee ability skills in your cover letter by
          openly&nbsp;
          showing your enthusiasm for the available position, stating
          your
          commitment to&nbsp; your career objective, indicating your
          motivation
          and your integrity, and showing&nbsp; that you are above all
          unselfish
          and credible.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          These skills are
          just as critical to your ability to do a great job as
          your&nbsp;
          professional experience and education – employers are looking
          for
          someone&nbsp; who will be a great fit on their team and in
          their
          organization, someone who&nbsp; works well under pressure but
          also has
          a sense of humor and has a balance&nbsp; between their
          personal and
          professional life.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Review your
          existing resume. Does it contain any employee ability skills?
          If
          not,&nbsp; make revisions to incorporate those employee
          ability skills
          you feel you excel in.&nbsp; If you are unsure, ask your
          friends or
          family for an objective opinion, so that you&nbsp; can get a
          better
          idea of how people around you see you as a person as well
          as&nbsp; a
          professional.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Keep these
          attributes in mind as you compose your resume and your cover
          letter,
          and especially as you are taking part in interviews. These
          skills can
          make&nbsp; a difference between knowing how to do a job and
          being
          qualified to exceed&nbsp; goals and grow in your career.&nbsp;

          Job hunting can
          be one of the most exhilarating and yet one of the most&nbsp;
          agonizing
          experiences in your life. While you look forward to the new
          chapter
          in&nbsp; your professional life, finding a way to stand out
          from other
          candidates, who are&nbsp; at least equally qualified for the
          position
          you want, is a difficult task.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Your resume is
          the first contact your potential employer has with you. A
          well&nbsp;
          formatted and a well-written resume can make a difference
          between
          getting the&nbsp; interview and getting the job, and being
          passed over.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Most employers
          receive a&nbsp; stack of resumes of qualified candidates and
          scan them
          quickly before they&nbsp; decide whether or not hey want to
          read
          further.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          You only have a
          few seconds to&nbsp; make a lasting impression. Don’t panic.
          Instead, focus on the design of your&nbsp; resume as it is the
          first
          thing your employer, whether on paper or in electronic&nbsp;
          form.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          The most
          commonly made mistake in resume design include using templates
          that are
          already available in Microsoft Word. While these templates
          provide
          a&nbsp; quick, easy to follow tools to create your resume,
          they are
          outdated, and they&nbsp; will make your resume appear generic
          and
          uninviting. Additionally, these&nbsp; templates, while well
          formatted
          in Microsoft Word, will not translate well when&nbsp; emailed
          or
          uploaded to job search engine web sites.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Second most
          commonly made mistake in resume design is inclusion of
          graphics&nbsp;
          on the page. Your picture and/or any other graphics are not
          appropriate
          for a&nbsp; resume. Including anything outside of plain text
          will make
          you stand out in a way&nbsp; that makes the employer think you
          are not
          taking yourself seriously as a&nbsp; professional, and this is
          certainly not the first impression you want to make. You&nbsp;
          can find
          samples of resumes on the Internet; search for resumes by
          your&nbsp;
          industry to find the templates that make most sense for the
          job you are
          seeking.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Than work on a
          blank page to replicate the look and feel of the resume you
          like. The
          following are basic formatting rules for your resume: Limit
          the length
          of the resume to two pages. The page should have one-inch
          margins, top
          and bottom, right and left. Use left justification only – as a
          rule, do not center the content of your&nbsp; resume.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          The font and
          font size should be consistent.&nbsp; The bullet points should
          be basic
          – use circles or squares, but never any&nbsp; symbols that may
          not translate well when you email your resume to your&nbsp;
          potential
          employer.&nbsp; Headlines can be in all caps; the remaining
          text should
          not have special&nbsp; formatting. Do not underline any of the
          information in your resume. In the world of&nbsp; Internet
          driven job
          applications, underlining in a document implies a web&nbsp;
          link.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The font size
          for headlines should not exceed 14 points; the remainder
          of&nbsp; the
          text in the resume should not exceed 12 points.&nbsp; Use the
          Tab key
          instead of the Space bar to create spaces between the&nbsp;

          your resume.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          As a last
          formatting check point, ask your friends or your family for
          help
          in&nbsp; reviewing your resume. Send the resume file via email
          to a few
          of your friends –&nbsp; ask them to review the resume and make
          sure nothing seems out of place. Print&nbsp; out the resume on
          paper
          and review to make sure that margins are accurately&nbsp; set,
          and that
          the content doesn’t appear crowded on the page. Keep in mind
          –&nbsp; when it comes to your resume, sleek simple appearance,
          and great writing, will&nbsp; get you the job you are
          seeking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

          You’ve
          heard it over and over again – a well-written resume is a
          winning&nbsp; resume. What does that mean? How can you
          determine
          whether your resume is&nbsp; written in a tone and style that
          employers
          will respond to?<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Synthesizing
          your&nbsp; educational achievements, years of your
          professional
          experience, and&nbsp; numerous qualifications you have
          acquired over
          the years into one to two pages&nbsp; is not easy to
          accomplish.&nbsp;
          Every phrase or statement you write has to convince your
          potential
          employer&nbsp; that you are the best candidate for the job. To
          do so,
          you will need to use action&nbsp; or power word.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Action words, or
          power words, are keywords (verbs) that add strength and&nbsp;
          positive
          implication to your job responsibilities or qualifications.<br>
          <br>
          When you&nbsp;
          submit your resume to your potential employer, there are two
          scenarios
          that will&nbsp; occur. One, your application will be ran
          through a
          computer software program,&nbsp; which searches your resume
          for key
          terms as indicated by the employer. If your&nbsp; resume
          contains those
          key words, your resume will be pulled aside for further&nbsp;
          review.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Two, a hiring
          manager, or most often a human resources associate, will
          receive&nbsp;
          a stack or resumes and scan through them quickly to pick out
          those that
          stand&nbsp; out the most, again based on certain key words. It
          should
          now be clear why&nbsp; these action words are critical to your
          success
          in job hunting.&nbsp; When listing your employment history,
          each
          job’s responsibilities should be&nbsp; listed in bullet point
          form, with each statement starting with an action word.&nbsp;
          <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Using power
          verbs or phrases will indicate to your employer that you are
          driven&nbsp; by action and results, and that you can
          effectively
          articulate your professional&nbsp; experience (thus,
          showcasing your
          communication skills).&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Here is a small
          sample of action words:&nbsp; Created&nbsp; Developed and
          Implemented&nbsp; Managed&nbsp; Delivered&nbsp; Designed&nbsp;
          Facilitated Negotiated&nbsp; Coordinated Budgeted&nbsp;
          Acted&nbsp;
          Communicated Consulted, etc.&nbsp; This is a very short
          sampling of
          action words. Many resources on the Internet&nbsp; contain
          extensive
          listings of action words or phrases. Do some research
          and&nbsp; use
          only those terms that are relevant to your field of
          experience.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Your best
          bet&nbsp; would be to locate samples of resumes by
          professionals in
          your industry. Review&nbsp; those resumes for ideas on how to
          list your
          responsibilities.&nbsp; Important note: do not copy exact
          statements
          from another persons resume;&nbsp; while you can do your
          research, you
          will want to make your resume&nbsp; personalized to your
          professional
          experience.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Don’t fall
          into the trap of using the same action word over and over. If
          you
          have&nbsp; in fact managed multiple projects, you may want to
          be a bit
          more specific about&nbsp; your role in each. For example,
          maybe you
          were the communication liaison in&nbsp; one project, while you
          were the
          project manager for another task. Begin the first&nbsp; bullet
          point
          with “communicated,” and the second bullet point with
          “managed.”&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          However, be
          aware of the words that you are using and consider their value
          in&nbsp;
          your resume. Do not go overboard with using varying terms,
          especially
          those&nbsp; that may change your role or your
          responsibilities.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Additionally,
          you can find key action words in job descriptions. Review
          your&nbsp;
          resume against a job description and make sure that all
          required
          qualifications&nbsp; are addressed in your statements. This
          will also
          help you identify action words&nbsp; that the employer uses,
          which you
          can in turn use to customize your resume or cover letter to
          that
          specific job.&nbsp; Always make sure that you are consistent
          in the way
          you list all of your&nbsp; responsibilities and
          qualifications, and
          make sure that your statements exude&nbsp; positive attitude
          and focus
          on actions and results. By doing so, you are&nbsp; guaranteed
          to create
          a winning resume that will get you noticed.<br>

          If you have
          never written a resume, the blank page you are facing can be
          very&nbsp;
          intimidating. While you can describe your job responsibilities
          to your
          friends,&nbsp; listing them out in a resume and showcasing how
          your
          experience to date meets&nbsp; your career objectives is a
          very
          difficult task.&nbsp; To get started, you must first consider
          what type
          of a job you are seeking.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Much&nbsp; like
          your career objective or summery should reflect your
          professional
          goals,&nbsp; your current and past experiences must showcase
          that you
          are the best&nbsp; candidate for the job you are applying for.
          In
          listing your current and past&nbsp; professional experiences,
          try to
          focus on those responsibilities that indicate you&nbsp; are
          qualified
          to take the next step in your career. <br>
          <br>
          Due to the fact
          that more and more companies as well as job search sites
          use&nbsp;
          scanning software to pick out candidates, it is very important
          that you
          use key&nbsp; words, including active verbs, to describe your
          skills.
          Instead of beginning your&nbsp; job descriptions with
          “Responsible for” try to use active verbs such as:&nbsp;
          Managed&nbsp; Developed&nbsp; Created&nbsp; Communicated
          Interfaced&nbsp; Achieved, etc.<br>
          <br>
          These key words
          get straight to the point of describing your
          responsibilities,&nbsp;
          which is exactly what the employers are looking for. Chose
          these words
          carefully&nbsp; – don’t say that you “managed a
          project”, implying you were responsible for the&nbsp; whole
          task
          from start to finish if you were only responsibly for
          communicating&nbsp; the project to other associates. Instead
          state that
          you “Developed and executed&nbsp; the communication strategy
          for
          associates,” describing your role more&nbsp; accurately and
          emphasizing your strengths.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Typically, the
          first job listed on your resume is the one you currently hold.
          In
          this&nbsp; case, make sure that your responsibilities are
          stated in
          present tense, as you&nbsp; are still responsible for them.
          For
          example, say “Manage accounting activities”&nbsp; instead
          of “Managed accounting activities.” This will indicate to
          your potential&nbsp; employer what your day-to-day activities
          are like
          and how they compliment&nbsp; responsibilities of the job you
          are
          submitting your resume for. All previous jobs&nbsp; should be
          listed
          using past tense, and should start with active verbs such
          as&nbsp;
          managed, developed, accomplished, etc.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Additionally,
          make sure that responsibilities you are listing are relevant
          for
          to&nbsp; your career objective. List only those
          responsibilities which
          help you put your&nbsp; best foot forward. For example, if you
          are
          looking for a job that requires&nbsp; managing a team of
          people, focus
          on your development and participation in&nbsp; group projects
          instead
          of focusing on solitary activities such as office&nbsp;
          organization. <br>
          <br>
          In terms of
          formatting, make sure that your responsibilities are listed in
          bullet&nbsp; points. This formatting is preferred to
          paragraphs on a
          resume because it is&nbsp; easier to review quickly. Employers
          simply
          scan the resumes and look for key&nbsp; words – if the resume
          looks overwhelming, with a lot of copy and poor&nbsp;
          formatting, they
          will likely discard it. Thus, it is very important that your
          resume
          is&nbsp; formatted with enough white space and doesn’t contain
          any errors.&nbsp; <br>

          For Entry
          Level&nbsp; Graduating from college is one of the proudest
          moments you
          can experience.&nbsp; Receiving your diploma validates all the
          hard
          work you put into your education,&nbsp; the all nights you
          pulled
          before exams. Your graduation signifies your&nbsp;
          accomplishments as a
          student, and opens the door into the world of career&nbsp;
          choices, job
          searches, and 40-hour workweeks.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          All of a sudden,
          it hits you –&nbsp; how will you get a job that requires
          experience if you have none?&nbsp; As a recent college
          graduate, you
          are entering the workforce at entry-level jobs.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Your potential
          employers have very reasonable expectations. They expect
          you&nbsp; to
          have graduated from college and that your major is in line
          with the job
          you are&nbsp; applying for. They anticipate that you have some
          experience, a summer job or&nbsp; an internship, but they are
          not
          requiring years of professional experience. They&nbsp; would
          like to
          see some references – from your professors or previous&nbsp;
          supervisors – so that they can get a better idea of your
          personality and work&nbsp; ethic. Sound reasonable so
          far?&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          The best way to
          show your potential employer that you are a perfect
          candidate&nbsp; for
          the job is to create a functional resume. Functional resumes
          focus on
          your&nbsp; qualifications, not your career time line. This
          style of the
          resume highlights what&nbsp; skills you have, rather than
          where and
          when you acquired or utilize them. <br>
          <br>
          In&nbsp; other
          words, instead of listing your experiences by your job titles,
          your
          resume&nbsp; will contained sections titled by your skills
          such as
          verbal and written&nbsp; communication, customer satisfaction,
          project
          management, etc. <br>
          <br>
          This resume
          style is highly recommended for and most often used by college
          students&nbsp; seeking internships or their first jobs out of
          college.&nbsp; Begin your resume by stating your career
          objective. Make
          sure that your career&nbsp; goals are personal. Your objective
          should
          be specific to the position you want,&nbsp; and should
          indicate to your
          employer how you intend to utilize your education&nbsp; and
          how this
          position will help you develop your experience. Your
          education&nbsp;
          should be listed next. <br>
          <br>
          List the school
          you attend and its location, your graduation&nbsp; year, and
          your
          major. It can be helpful to include your GPA, specific courses
          you&nbsp; have taken, or any honors you have received while in
          school.&nbsp; Your professional skills should come next.<br>
          <br>
          This section
          will include sub-headings&nbsp; as they relate to specific
          qualifications you want to promote, such as&nbsp;
          communications,
          customer relations, managements, etc. Here, you can
          utilize&nbsp; any
          experience you have that relates to the sub-sections,
          including your
          part&nbsp; time jobs, internships, volunteer positions,
          community
          service work, or school- related activities. Only include a
          work
          experience/work history section if you&nbsp; have held part
          time jobs
          while in school or have had internships you’d like your&nbsp;
          employer to know about.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          This list should
          only include dates, titles, companies, and locations
          without&nbsp;
          listing any of your responsibilities, since you are covering
          them in
          the previous&nbsp; section. If you belonged to any clubs in
          school,
          include a section for activities&nbsp; and list only those
          that support
          your career objective. <br>
          <br>
          For example, if
          you were an editor of your school paper, and you are trying to
          get a
          job at a publishing&nbsp; company, make sure that you include
          this
          experience in your resume.&nbsp; Your last section should list
          references. <br>
          <br>
          As a new
          graduate, it is to your benefit&nbsp; to include references on
          your
          resume, and give your employer everything they&nbsp; need to
          consider
          you as a qualified candidate for the job. You have nothing
          to&nbsp;
          lose by providing this information ahead of being asked for
          it.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          Before you start
          applying for jobs, take advantage of your school’s career
          center&nbsp; and have one of the mentors there review your
          resume and
          help you perfect&nbsp; both the content and the format. With a
          well-written resume, you are prepared to&nbsp; take the
          professional
          world by storm.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
