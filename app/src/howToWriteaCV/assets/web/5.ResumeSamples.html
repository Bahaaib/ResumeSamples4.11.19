          Writing a resume
          is a difficult task regardless of your level of experience
          with
          the&nbsp; process. While the content of your resume is
          critical to its
          effectiveness, the&nbsp; layout and the format you utilize are
          equally
          as important. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          To get started,
          you&nbsp; should research various resume styles and find out
          which best
          stouts your field.&nbsp; The biggest mistake people make when
          composing
          their resume is using a&nbsp; generic template provided in
          your text
          editing software, like Microsoft Word. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          These templates
          are usually outdated and very difficult to format, not to
          mention&nbsp;
          that they do not transfer well to online job applications.
          Avoid the
          quick-fix&nbsp; mentality of these resume templates, and
          invest some
          time in finding resources&nbsp; that will provide you with
          up-to-date
          helpful ways to compose a winning resume.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The easiest and
          least expensive way to find samples of resumes in your&nbsp;
          industry
          is to do a search on the internet. Before you get started, a
          word
          of&nbsp; caution: consider the sources of information before
          you decide
          to utilize any of&nbsp; their suggestions on your resume. You
          will come
          across web sites that promise&nbsp; to teach you how to write
          an
          exceptional cover letter in three and a half minutes.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Don’t
          believe them.&nbsp; Unless you chose to hire a resume writing
          service,
          obtaining resources on&nbsp; resume writing should not cost
          you any
          money or obligate you to a long-term&nbsp; commitment. If
          unsure of the
          credibility on information you see, find another&nbsp; source
          and
          compare your findings.&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          It is important
          that you review these samples as they will teach you the basic
          do and
          do-not of&nbsp; resume writing – you can see why some things
          work
          and why others don’t, and&nbsp; be able to chose the best ways
          to
          highlight your qualifications.&nbsp; Same school rules apply –
          do
          not copy another persons work.<br>
          <br>
          However,
          use&nbsp; these resources to your advantage and create the
          resume that
          presents you in&nbsp; the best light.&nbsp;
