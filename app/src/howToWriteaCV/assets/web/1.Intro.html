          In the
          competitive, internet-driven world of job searches, your CV
          (or resume)
          represents you to potential employers. It serves as your tool
          to
          attract attention, get the interview and/or get a job. A great
          resume
          will make you stand out from other candidates by showcasing
          your
          aptitudes. Think of your resume as your sales pitch – you need
          to
          sell yourself in the best possible way. Invest some time and
          research
          into developing your CV/resume. <br>

          A resume is a
          one or to two-page document summarizing your career
          objectives,
          professional experiences achievements, and educational
          background. The
          heading of the resume should contain your name, address and
          contact
          information. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The body of the
          resume should be broken into the following sections:&nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <b>Career Objective
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>

          </b><b>References </b><br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Your career
          objective should be brief, up to two sentences; it should give
          your
          potential employers an idea of how you wish to move forward in
          your
          professional life. Scholastic <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          A concise
          profile or a summary should discuss who you are and how your
          skills and
          experience best apply to the job you are interested in. The
          summary, as
          well as other parts of your resume, should not contain
          personal
          information that discloses ethnicity, sexual orientation,
          marital
          status, age, living situations, or any other
          personal information that is not directly related to your
          career. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Personal
          profile/summary should only contain a few well-written
          sentences that
          convey what you can bring to the table in terms of the
          specific job. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Use this section
          to attract the employer’s attention, but don’t go overboard
          in trying to be creative – stay professional. Your experience
          listing should include information on one to five jobs you’ve
          held, starting with your current or last job, and listing
          previous
          positions in chronological order. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          The listing
          should include the date range of your employment, name of the
          companies
          or person(s) you have worked for, and the city and state where
          the
          place of employment is located (full address of employment is
          not
          necessary). <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          List your title
          and your main responsibilities, with emphasis on duties that
          are
          applicable to the type of work you are seeking. Your education
          should
          include college, graduate and post-graduate work, as well as
          any
          courses or professional certifications that are relevant to
          your career
          development. Achievements, volunteer positions, publications
          and
          interests should only be listed if they apply to your
          professional work
          experience <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          References
          should be listed if requested; best practices suggest not to
          list
          generic statements about&nbsp; <br>
          references being
          available upon request as this is understood. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          You will want to
          make sure that your resume is error free – double check your
          grammar and spelling, make sure that all company and school
          names and
          cities are spelled properly. A resume containing errors, no
          matter how
          minimal, will give your potential employer an impression that
          you do
          not have attention to detail, that you don’t take time to
          double
          check your work, and that you are a poor communicator.
          Additionally,
          make sure that your resume is formatted well. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Stick to basic
          fonts, like Arial and Times New Roman. Keep the font size and
          color
          standard; don’t use large fonts or multiple colors in your
          resume. Don’t go overboard with bold, italicized, or large-cap
          text. Keep your format consistent and make sure that the
          resume looks
          great when viewed online as well as when printed out. Keep
          your resume
          to one or two pages – any additional pages give an impression
          that you either don’t know how to concisely summarize your
          education and experience, or that you are listing unnecessary
          information for the sake of taking up space. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          If you’ve
          never written a resume before, reference books, Internet
          resources or
          seek assistance from a professional resume writing service. A
          well-written resume can make a difference between being stuck
          at your
          current job and getting an interview to land the job of your
          dreams. <br>

          Facing a blank
          page when you are trying to write a resume can be very scary.
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          You may think
          that you don’t have enough to say about yourself to fill a
          page;
          you may be wondering just how to list all of your skills and
          experience
          within a single sheet of paper. To get started, ask yourself
          some
          questions about your past jobs and your career goals. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Before you even
          begin writing a resume, define the exact reasons why you need
          one.
          While this may sound simple, it takes more than saying, “I
          want
          to get a new job.” Consider your career objective first. Make
          sure that your goals are specific in terms of industry,
          position title,
          and future professional achievements. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Once you are
          clear on the type of job you are seeking, it will be much
          easier to
          compose a resume that highlights your expertise in the area of
          your
          interest. Once you have your career objective developed, do
          some
          research on a resume format that is most commonly used and may
          be most
          appropriate for your industry. Search the Internet or check
          out the
          books in your local library to get a better idea of what
          well-written
          professional resumes look like. Once you find a format that
          best suits
          your field and your career objective, use the same layout to
          get
          started. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          When listing
          your personal information at the top of the resume, include
          your
          address, home and/or mobile phone number, and your email
          address. A
          helpful hint about listing your email address – make sure that
          it
          contains your name, as this helps you
          appear more professional. You can create a free Yahoo email
          account; it
          also maybe helpful to have one email address as a point of
          contact for
          your job search. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          Before you begin
          listing your experiences, make sure to list them out on a
          separate
          sheet of paper, in chronological order, starting with the most
          recent
          job you had (possibly the job you are presently holding). List
          up to
          five previous jobs you have held, although make sure that your
          resume
          does not exceed two pages in length. Make sure that are listed
          in
          order; don’t skip any of your employments as this will create
          gaps in your professional history. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          When listing
          your education, start with your college attendance and move to
          your
          most recent accomplishments. If you never attended college,
          make sure
          to include any courses, even if they were taken as training at
          your
          previous jobs, which will help in showcasing your
          qualifications. In
          terms of skills, make sure to list, in bullet point form, all
          of the
          abilities that confirm that you are the best candidate for the
          job you
          are seeking. <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          You can omit
          references from your resume, but let your potential employer
          know that
          you can provide them if necessary. You can do so in the cover
          letter or
          by including a line at the bottom of your resume that simply
          states,
          “Professional references available upon request.” <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          As your final
          check point, ask a friend or a family member to review your
          resume, and
          give you feedback. Having a second pair of eyes can help you
          correct
          any typos, or even bring to your attention anything that
          appears
          unclear or confusing. A well-written, error-free resume will
          help you
          put your best foot forward and get the job that exceeds your
          career
          goals. <br>
