          Resumes – Dos and Don’ts</b><br>
      </font></div>
    <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
      There are two most commonly used methods for resume submission:
      uploading your resume to the employer’s web site or to the resume
      bank, and e-mailing your resume to the employer. Faxing or mailing
      your resume is virtually an obsolete practice, because employers
      are heavily relying on software programs that scan resumes for key
      words related to the available positions at their organizations.
      However, printed resumes are necessary for interviews. Thus, as
      professionals, we essentially have to have two versions of our
      resume. While there are numerous resources for composing a more
      traditionally formatted resume, many professionals are not sure
      how to create electronic resumes that will get noticed. To help
      you out, here are some dos and don’ts:<br>
      <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO create a plain text file of your resume.
      While you want certain items on your resume to stand out, you
      should still have a plain text file (.txt file) of your resume.
      Most employers request a plain text file, because they can run the
      file through computer software that scans your resume for key
      words related to the available jobs. When creating a text file,
      makes sure that you take the time to format the resume; check
      spacing and adjust any lines of text that seem out of place.<br>
      <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO follow instructions of your potential
      employer. If the employer is asking that you send your resume in
      the body of the e-mail, do not send them an attachment. Copy and
      paste the plain text resume you have created into the body of the
      email; take the time to check for potential formatting changes. Do
      not try to format the text by making portions of your resume bold,
      or change the font size or type. While you may have the email
      editor which allows for this formatting, your potential employer
      may only accept plain text messages. Stick to the basics for a
      successful transmission of your resume.<br>
      <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DON’T save your resume as a PDF. This file
      type is typically larger in size, and is not very common for an
      electronic resume, that your potential employer may completely
      discard your email.<br>
      <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO test your electronic resume by sending it
      to a few friends via email. Because they may be using different
      e-mail providers, or have different software than you, they can
      let you know how your resume appears to them. This will help you
      in uncovering and correcting potential formatting problems, to
      assure that your resume is in great form by the time it reaches
      potential employers.<br>
      <br>
      •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DON’T make an assumption that including a
      resume in the body of an email is the only information you should
      include in your message to your potential employer. Even if the
      resume is copied into the email, you still need to let your
      employer know a little bit more about yourself via a cover letter.
      However, since you will include your address at the top of the
      email, feel free to start your resume with a career objective
      instead of including the heading with your name and address.<br>

      When you are in the hunt for a new job, resume formats are vital
      to this search. Convenient for you, Microsoft Word can be utilized
      to spruce up your resume. Even if you are not a pro at resume
      writing, Microsoft Word can assist you in completing your task at
      hand.<br>
      <br>
      Almost every job application requires some sort of resume. The
      resume is one of the most important factors potential employers
      look at when evaluating you for a possible position. A quality
      resume will help you get the job you are after. If your resume is
      unformatted, loose, or printed on stationary, employers may
      eliminate you from the job consideration.<br>
      <br>
      Contrary what some might think, it is unadvisable to use the
      standard default template that Microsoft Word provides. Could you
      imagine how many other people have probably used that same
      template when applying for the same job you are after? One idea
      that has been successful for me is to download a sample template
      that can be implemented into Microsoft Word. There are many free
      resume templates available, so cost is not an issue.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, resumes are formatted as follows: objective,
      achievements, honors, experience, education, skills, and ending
      with your hobbies or interests. A variation of this format would
      be: objective, experience, education, skills, interests,
      achievements, and finally honors.<br>
      <br>
      From my previous experience, each will get the job done. If you
      are interested in a job that is outside the writing industry, the
      second example works well. A properly formatted resume is
      essential when applying for a job, however it is also advisable to
      use positive words throughout your resume. If you use negative
      wording, many employers may discard your submitted resume.<br>
      <br>
      Proper resume formatting is only half the battle when it comes to
      resume writing. Bad grammar, poor word choices, and uninformative
      content can lead to a dismal resume. The goal is to tie everything
      together to provide a well documented paper regarding your work
      history and prior experience. Utilize the tools available online
      for resumes and you can land the job you are after.<br>
