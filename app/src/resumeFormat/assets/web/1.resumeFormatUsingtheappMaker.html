      Welcome!<br>
      <br>
      This app contains a superb, easy to use Resume Builder as well as
      valuable information about writing your Resume. You are welcome to
      use as much or as little of it as you like.<br>
      <br>
      Go through the information about Resumes, first. This gives you
      valuable help about how to write your Resume.<br>
      <br>
      Click on the menu item called Resume Builder to start creating
      your Resume. It is simple to use. Remember, you can download your
      Resume to your phone or tablet or you can email it to yourself or
      anyone else.&nbsp; The Resume should save to your Download folder.
      Files can sometimes be difficult to find on mobile devices so just
      email it to yourself if you cannot find it after downloading.<br>
      <br>
      The Resume will save as a Word file (.doc) called resume.docx so
      that you can use your desktop computer to make it even better, if
      you wish. Remember to save it as a PDF when you have finished
      editing it on your desktop to send to employers.<br>
      <br>
      There are a selection of Resume Templates in this app for you to
      use. We will be adding more - so please keep this app on your
      device and check back for updates. </font><font face="Arial"><br>
