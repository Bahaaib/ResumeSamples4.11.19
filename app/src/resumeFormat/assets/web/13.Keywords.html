      For some reason, writing a description of ourselves and our life
      achievements is a difficult task. It is easy enough to recount our
      life to others, yet when it involves describing it with the aim of
      securing a job; suddenly the words to describe our talents escape
      us. Thus, the process of resume writing begins. To make a resume
      which describes personal achievements in a manner that will get
      noticed, the power of words must be used, as the use of keywords
      can make or break a resume. <br>
      <br>
      Keywords consist of the lexicon that relates to the field you are
      applying to work in. Including such vocabulary indicates some
      savvy of the field, and will immediately attract employers’ eyes
      to a resume. Keywords are also the words which make a strong
      resume: words of action, and words that show accomplishment and
      achievement - as opposed to words that merely describe previous
      employment. Lastly, use the vocabulary to market the resume.
      Marketing has proven to be a powerful tool, and should be used in
      the instrument of the resume. Using the right keywords can
      strongly change the tone of a resume, turning average curriculum
      vitae into a stellar description of achievements and talent.<br>
      <br>
      Very often, if you are applying to one job, you are applying to
      many. Great - as chances of finding a fitting job are increased;
      not so great - as the resume is made to conform to as many job
      applications as possible. Fortunately, most of the various jobs
      being applied to fall under the same genre, so the resume will fit
      the majority of the jobs. However, it is important to make the
      resume as specific as possible to each job. This not only
      increases your chances of being noticed, as tailoring your resume
      to highlight your most applicable skills and experience to each
      particular job will result in a more interesting resume than a
      generalized one, but also shows the potential employer that you
      truly are interested in the specific position, and have put effort
      into making a resume that is not generic. Steering away from the
      general resume and keeping a resume focused is only a good thing
      in job applications.<br>
      <br>
      This is where keywords come in. It is vital to show potential
      employers that you are a hard worker who will be a benefit to the
      company - as well as the type of employee who already knows about
      the field. If you are not yet acquainted, become knowledgeable in
      the lexicon pertaining to the job. Show that your previous jobs
      have used skills that will need to be used in this job. Indicate
      that you are not only capable, but you are interested enough to
      invest your time in learning about it before being promised a
      salary in the job. This shows potential and dedication, traits
      simple to convey by using the correct keywords which correspond to
      that which the career requires.<br>
      <br>
      The mistake that far too many resume writers make is thinking that
      the best manner of phrasing must be the route that others have
      taken. In a resume, keeping to an accepted form is in order, but
      using others’ words is not! This will make your resume like any
      other - tidy, complete, and boring. When browsing through others’
      resumes, learn and follow good resume form, and learn and avoid
      the common words. The vocabulary used must be relevant to you, and
      help describe as specifically as possible what you have done
      throughout your education and previous employments. Vocabulary
      that is relevant to you is not only that which applies to the job
      you want, but that which applies to you: don’t use words which you
      don’t know the meaning of - it’s important that your resume
      reflects you. <br>
      <br>
      At the same time, be sure to use proper grammar, and vocabulary
      that it is not obsolete. In other words, stay within the boundary:
      use vocabulary to indicate that you are a well-educated,
      contemporary person, who leaves out pretentious words and common
      slang, as neither end of the spectrum will strengthen a resume.<br>
      <br>
      The words that you will use should be words that make you the most
      desirable candidate. In other words, your resume is your strongest
      initial marketing tool, and word choice plays a large role in this
      marketing scheme. Words should show you as an active, contributing
      player to every job and team you have worked with. Your resume
      should highlight your achievements at previous jobs - not your
      responsibilities. Using words of action make you jump from the
      paper into the resume reader’s mind. <br>
      <br>
      Exclude jobs that do not apply in any way to the job you hope for,
      and turn your activities into points that strengthen your
      potential as a candidate. For instance, focus on how you brought
      the soccer team together and the great group dynamics you helped
      to establish as captain of the team. This is more valuable
      knowledge than a winning record (unless you are an NCAA champion).
      This extra step of care put into your resume will result in a much
      stronger resume.<br>
      <br>
      Making a unique resume takes thought and effort, but is possible
      and very worth it. An average list of accomplishments and
      employments can become a strong resume if phrased correctly.
      Remembering to use keywords pertaining to the career, as well as
      keywords which set your resume apart can make the difference
      between an average and an exceptional resume. Marketing yourself
      as not merely a good worker and team member, but as a creative
      addition, will also strengthen the value of a resume. Make sure
      that in fitting the form of a standard resume, yours is completely
      unique when it comes to content. Words, those strings of morphemes
      which the world is never short of, are the secret to making a
      strong, unique resume when used with careful thought and
      attention.<br>
