      <div align="left"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Eczema, an itchy inflammation of the skin,
              effects many people in different forms, with one of the
              most common being scalp eczema.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The scalp is
              vulnerable because the skin of the scalp is different than
              skin elsewhere on the body. The scalp has a very rich
              supply of grease from the sebaceous glands as well as
              carrying follicles creating long hairs.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">There are
              other symptoms to watch for with eczema besides itching. A
              person suffering from a form of eczema may also experience
              redness of the affected area, dry skin, lumps or blisters,
              and possibly signs of superficial infection such as
              weeping or crusty deposits.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">It is
              important to let your medical provider know if you are
              suffering these symptoms and to which parts of your body,
              as there are several types of eczema, including atopic,
              allergic contact, irritant contact, discoid, seborrhoeic,
              and many others.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Eczema is
              actually a fairly common condition with atopic eczema (the
              “allergic” type often seen in people with allergies or
              asthma), affecting about 10-20 percent of school children
              and 3-5 percent of adults in the UK.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">This number
              is increasing and becoming more common. The cause of this
              strain becoming more common may be due to an increased
              exposure to allergens such as house dust or environmental
              factors.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Now that we
              know what the symptoms are, how is eczema and scalp eczema
              treated? Treatment can consist of topical creams or
              ointments that are applied regularly.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Or, if the
              area is infected, your medical provider may prescribe
              antimicrobial medicines, such as antibiotics, antifungals,
              or antivirals. These may either be taken orally or
              topically.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Depending on
              the severity of your condition, either method has proven
              over time to be effective.</font></big></big><br>
        <br>
        <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Although
              eczema or scalp eczema are conditions which can be
              annoying or troublesome, there is hope that the treatments
              can be effective and one suffering from eczema can lead a
              full, productive life.</font></big></big><br>

          Hair health begins with good Hair And Scalp Conditioning. No
          matter your hair type, cut, or texture, your personal style is
          enhanced when your hair is healthy and strong. Conditioning
          your hair and scalp helps prevent damage, enhances shine, and
          helps prevent hair and scalp dryness. All you need to do is
          choose the best hair products and , moisturizing shampoos and
          conditioners, and non-damaging hair products.<br>
          <br>
          To help develop your Hair And Scalp Conditioning routine, you
          must first consider your hair type, texture, and cut. Fine
          hair requires different products than thick hair and curly
          hair requires different products than straight hair. When
          searching for a conditioner, decide on a leave-in conditioner,
          shampoo out conditioner, hot oil treatment, or deep
          conditioning products. <br>
          <br>
          Also keep in mind that if you apply extra heat to your hair
          using a dryer or curling iron, you will need products with
          extra moisture. Products specific to your hair type help
          enhance its best qualities. When considering products keep in
          mind that it is good to have a few conditioning products on
          hand that serve different purposes. You'll want to find at
          least one product for every day use and one for deep
          conditioning. Make sure you condition your hair each time you
          shampoo to help replace any lost moisture that may have been
          washed away.<br>
          <br>
          After you select your Hair And Scalp Conditioning products, it
          is time to choose your hairbrushes and other styling tools
          such as hair dryers and curling irons. Different brushes are
          designed for different hair types. Some help detangle, some
          are designed for use with a hair dryer, others are used to
          help add body such and still others are meant to add extra
          shine. Brush your hair in the morning, evening, and before
          your showers or baths to help distribute natural hair oils.
          When brushing, don't pull or tear at your hair. This can cause
          damage.<br>
          <br>
          Another step to consider is the scalp massage. Scalp massages
          help increase blood flow to the scalp and help distribute
          natural oils. This helps increase shine, strength, and
          softness. You can add Hair And Scalp Conditioning oil during
          the massage to help add extra moisturizing qualities. Have
          your stylist show you how to give a proper scalp massage, or
          have a massage therapist show you. <br>
          <br>
          The stylist can also show you scalp oils that are best suited
          to your hair type. You can either purchase oils or create your
          own oil blend using items you have around the house and the
          essential oils of your choosing. Just make sure you research
          essential oils so you don't pick something that is harmful.<br>
          <br>
          A good Hair And Scalp Conditioning routine includes many
          elements. You need to choose the proper shampoo and
          conditioner for your hair type. You also need to pick the
          perfect brushes and tools for your needs. The addition of a
          scalp massage also helps enhance hair health. When all these
          factors are in place your hair will be strong, healthy, and
          properly conditioned.<br>
