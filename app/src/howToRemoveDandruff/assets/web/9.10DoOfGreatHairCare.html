          If the amount of money consumers spend on hair care products
          annually is any indication, most people are concerned about
          the appearance of their hair and strive to attain beautiful,
          healthy and stylish locks. In fact, most will go to any
          lengths to achieve their desired look. From professional salon
          treatments to over-the-counter serums, hair care is a big
          business.<br>
          <br>
          The only problem is that while many people are buying the
          right hair care products for their hair, they forget to follow
          basic hair care regimens that will guarantee the health and
          beauty of their tresses. Additionally, many are also causing
          needless damage to their hair by participating in unhealthy
          hair care behavior.<br>
          <br>
          So, what should you do to make sure that your hair stays
          healthy, shiny and strong? Here are 10 essential "must dos" of
          great hair care.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Hair Care </b><b>D</b><b>os</b><br>
          <br>
          1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use the right hair care products for your
          specific hair type. If you're hair is damaged, dry or color
          treated, use hair care products formulated to repair this
          damage and add much-needed shine and resiliency. On the other
          hand, if your hair is oily, use a deep-cleansing shampoo and
          light conditioner to keep your hair looking its best. The
          right products should be at the base of your hair care
          routine.<br>
          <br>
          2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Get a trim every 6 to 8 weeks as part of
          your regular hair care routine. Even if you are growing your
          hair longer, it is still vital to make a routine trim a major
          part of your hair care routine. Snipping ends before they
          split will keep your hair looking healthy and save you hair
          care headaches in the end.<br>
          <br>
          3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Protect your hair with hair care products
          that contain sunscreen.<br>
          <br>
          4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shampoo your hair only when it is dirty.
          Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to shampoo your
          hair daily. Doing so can make your hair dry and hard to work
          with.<br>
          <br>
          5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn to a professional for all of your
          hair care needs. Yes, kitchen beauticians and friends do not
          cost as much as putting your hair care needs in the hands of a
          qualified professional, but they often result in blunders that
          end up costing you more money than if you went to the salon in
          the first place.<br>
          <br>
          6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use professional conditioning hair
          coloring systems. There are many hair coloring systems on the
          market, and the ones you choose can have a great impact on
          your hair care costs. Simply put: choose a system that causes
          minimal damage and conditions hair as it colors. This will
          save you money when it comes to conditioning hair care
          products.<br>
          <br>
          7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stick with one chemical service. In order
          to keep your hair as healthy as it can be, ask your hair care
          professional to recommend only one chemical service: color or
          perm. By only using the service that is perfect for your
          particular style and needs, you will ensure that your hair
          stays healthier.<br>
          <br>
          8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Add Texture. By adding texture to your
          style, through perm or cut, you can greatly reduce the time it
          takes to style and perform your daily hair care routine. And
          you will look sensational.<br>
          <br>
          9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choose hair color that compliments your
          style. With all of the professional coloring techniques
          available, this part of your hair care regimen has never been
          easier. From chunky highlights to soft color, you can greatly
          enhance your style with the right technique.<br>
          <br>
          10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Comb your hair with a wide-toothed come
          when it is wet to prevent breakage. The only time you should
          use a brush during your hair care routine is when your hair is
          barely damp or dry.<br>
          In the end, hair care is a very individualized and personal
          thing. <br>
          <br>
          Feel free to add your own flair and style to your hair care
          routine, but remember to include hair care principles that
          will benefit your hair and avoid those that damage it.<br>
