          Dandruff is probably one of the oldest ailment known to man
          and has always been regarded as a very embarrassing condition.
          Apparently, during the Medieval Ages, most people did not wash
          their bodies on a regular basis, and certainly not their hair.
          Due to poor hygiene and lack of knowledge about human illness,
          people have been afflicted with dandruff.<br>
          <br>
          Many people have this chronic scalp disorder, which is marked
          by itching and excessive flaking of the scalp. Although
          dandruff isn't contagious and is rarely serious, it can be
          really irritating and surprisingly persistent.<br>
          <br>
          According to a major health product manufacturer, dandruff
          affects more than 50% of the population of the USA, so it is
          more common to have dandruff than not. It can occur at any
          age, but is most likely in the early '20s. It is usually
          seasonal and it is most severe during the winter and mildest
          during the summer.<br>
          <br>
          About 25 years ago, dermatologists started to blame a fungus
          as the cause of dandruff. Fungi are microscopic plant
          organisms that consist of cells, such as mould, mildew, and
          yeast. They cannot produce their own food, thus they behave as
          either parasites or saprophytes, absorbing nutrients from
          organic matter, such as humans and animals. <br>
          <br>
          Essentially fungi are infections. More commonly known as
          moulds and yeasts, fungi are found in nature, and they appear
          in the environment (Geophilic), on humans (Anthropophlic), and
          on animals (Zoophilic). A tiny fungus called Pityrosporum
          Ovale is said to be the main culprit why dandruff and other
          infections occur on human hair and scalp.<br>
          <br>
          The vast majority of hair infections usually occur in
          children. Mild scaling of the scalp, or a very inflamed
          abscess caused by bacteria are evidence of dandruff. It is
          very important to diagnose scalp hair fungal infection in
          children as well as those in close contact to clear the
          infection as well as to prevent permanent bald patches or hair
          loss.<br>
          <br>
          Because dandruff usually starts after puberty and is more
          common in men than women, hormones may also be involved. For
          unknown reasons, people with some illnesses such as
          Parkinsonâ€™s disease are more likely to have dandruff.<br>
          <br>
          Dandruff particles are visible flakes of skin that have been
          continuously shed from the scalp. It is normal to shed some
          dead skin flakes as the skin is constantly renewing itself.
          The new cells are formed into the lower layers. They are
          gradually pushed to the surface as more new cells form beneath
          them. By the time, they reach the surface, the cells have
          become flat and overlap each other like roof tiles. These
          cells are dead then and are shed from the surface all the
          time. They are so small, that we humans do not notice this is
          happening.<br>
          <br>
          With dandruff, this whole process of skin renewal (or skin
          turnover) speeds up, so a greater number of dead cells are
          being shed. The cells are also shed in clumps, which are big
          enough to be seen with the naked eye as embarrassing flakes,
          especially when they land on dark clothing. The scalp may also
          feel slightly itchy.<br>
          <br>
          However, the good news is that dandruff can be controlled.
          Mild cases of dandruff may need nothing more than daily
          shampooing with a gentle cleanser. And stubborn flakes often
          respond to medicated shampoos. When regular shampoos fail,
          over-the-counter (OTC) shampoos can do the thing. The most
          effective medical treatment is an anti-yeast shampoo
          containing ketoconazole, which one can buy from a chemist
          without a doctor's prescription. <br>
          <br>
          But dandruff shampoos aren't all alike, and one may need to
          experiment until he or she can find one that works best.<br>
