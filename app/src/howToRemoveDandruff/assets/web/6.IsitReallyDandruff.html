          Everybody hates dandruff. No body likes the falling white
          flakes and the itching scalp. we all try many shampoos and
          treatments, both natural and chemical to get rid of dandruff.
          I want to ask many of you who suffer dandruff- how are you
          sure that you are having dandruff? Unless a doctor diagnosed
          it as dandruff, how can any one be sure that he/she is
          suffering dandruff if it is not clearing after many washes?
          May be you are suffering from something else? Let us look at
          the other problems that may confuse you.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Dandruff and other scalp problems-</b><br>
          <br>
          There are many scalp problems that itch and produce scales and
          white flakes. Psoriasis is one of the tough ones. Unless you
          get it diagnosed and get treated it will not go away. Many
          cosmetic applications may cause allergic dermatitis or
          irritant contact dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis or commonly
          called eczema can also appear on the scalp. Seborrheic
          dermatitis is one of the common scalp problems that mimic
          dandruff.<br>
          <br>
          <b>What is dandruff?</b><br>
          <br>
          In dandruff what we see as white flakes are skin cells. Our
          skin regenerates itself every month. The new cells travel from
          the bottom of the skin layer to the top in a month and the
          dead cells are shed. These are so microscopic and small in
          quantity that we don't notice this shedding of cells. In
          dandruff this shedding increases. That is how these dead cells
          with skin oils form white flakes and we can see them.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Dandruff and Diagnosis</b><br>
          <br>
          If you are not able to get rid of dandruff after trying many
          formulas, it is time that you visit a doctor and get the
          proper diagnosis done. Once you are sure that it is dandruff,
          you can take proper measures and get a shiny scalp.<br>

          Dandruff - that dry, itchy, white flaking of the scalp -
          affects up to 70% of the population in various degrees of
          severity. It results from skin cells reproducing too rapidly,
          producing visible flakes. Dandruff is worse in dry climates
          and when the hair is not washed often. Mild dandruff can be
          kept under control with shampoos containing zinc pyrithione. <br>
          <br>
          <b>What happens when these do not work?</b><br>
          <br>
          This means you may have stubborn, more severe dandruff. And if
          you have yellowish crusting (scales) either on the scalp,
          face, chest or back, you may have seborrheic dermatitis. In
          this case, the crusty scales are often oily, accompanied by a
          red, itchy scalp. Seborrheic dermatitis tends to flare up with
          stress and with the cold, dry winter months.<br>
          <br>
          An effective option for these stubborn cases is shampoos
          containing tar which have a triple action - they dissolve the
          scales, are antiseptic (fight bacteria), and soothe itching
          and redness. <br>
          <br>
          Tar shampoos are usually safe to use and effective against
          severe dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis. A tar shampoo can be
          highly effective if it is a combination of tar with salicylic
          acid, as well as an antifungal and soothing menthol.<br>
          <br>
          Here are some general tips to follow:<br>
          <br>
          Shampoo at least 3 times a week with a non-medicated shampoo
          or an anti-dandruff shampoo (depending on severity), massaging
          scalp gently<br>
          <br>
          Three times a week, do the following: use an anti-dandruff
          shampoo first to clean your scalp, then rinse well. Follow
          with a trusted medicated shampoo; <br>
          <br>
          Make sure you leave it in contact with your scalp for at least
          5 minutes before rinsing.<br>
          <br>
          If your scalp condition does not improve within 2 weeks of
          this regimen, see your physician or pharmacist.<br>
