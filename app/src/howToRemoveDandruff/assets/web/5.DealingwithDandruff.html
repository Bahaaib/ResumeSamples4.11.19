          <b>Causes of Dan</b><b>druff</b><br>
          <br>
          Although the cause of dandruff is not completely understood,
          it is currently theorized that one of the main causes is a
          breakdown of the scalps natural lipid barrier, leaving it more
          exposed to infection by the microscopic yeast that is commonly
          found in the scalp. When the yeast overgrows, it leads to an
          inflammatory response that kills off scalp cells at a high
          rate, which in turn slough off in sticky patches and flakes.<br>
          <br>
          The condition is identified by:<br>
          <br>
          - White or clear flakes on the scalp, through the hair, and on
          clothing.<br>
          <br>
          - Itchy scalp which may be red and inflamed.<br>
          <br>
          Some young teens find they develop dandruff when they hit
          puberty because their hygiene habits haven’t changed to meet
          the challenges of newly accelerated sebum production.<br>
          <br>
          Stress, poor hygiene and poor diet can make the scalp more
          susceptible to dandruff. High sugar foods in particular are
          known to exacerbate yeast infections.<br>
          <br>
          The hair should be brushed regularly to loosen flakes and
          stimulate blood supply to the scalp, which will accelerate the
          natural immune response to infection.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Treating Dan</b><b>druff</b><br>
          <br>
          There are few habits you can develop and natural treatments
          you can use to treat dandruff.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Nutrition:</b> An excess of sugar in the diet can
          exacerbate any yeast infection. Try reducing your intake of
          all sugars and refined starches while treating for dandruff.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Cleansing:</b> Massage your scalp thoroughly with your
          fingertips when shampooing. This will help loosen and remove
          any dead skin flakes and help prevent the infection from
          continuing. Wash your hair daily until the infection is
          cleared up.<br>
          <br>
          Conditioning: Use a protective hair condition on the ends of
          hair only. Avoid getting conditioner on your scalp where it
          can clog pores and interfere with healing of the skin.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Other Treatments:</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>- Massage:</b> Massaging your scalp several times a day
          with the pads of the fingers only will stimulate blood supply
          to the hair follicles and help loosen the dead skin flakes.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>- Brushing:</b> Brushing your hair thoroughly on a
          daily basis will help loosen and remove dead skin flakes,
          increase the smooth flow of sebum along the hair shaft, and
          increase blood supply to the hair follicles.<br>
          <br>
          <b>- Wash Hands After Brushing and Grooming Hair: </b>Fungal
          infections of the skin are highly contagious, and it is easy
          to reinfect and spread to other areas of the body. This is why
          it’s important to wash your hair daily and to brush out any
          loose dandruff flakes – so that healthy areas of the scalp
          will not be infected. Washing your hands after brushing,
          massaging and grooming your hair will also help prevent
          reinfection or cross infection.<br>
          <br>
          The following herbs and nutrients have been shown to reduce
          dandruff infections:<br>
          <br>
          <b>Natural Internal Treatments for Dandruff</b><br>
          <br>
          Alpha-Lipoic Acid, Vanadyl Sulfate, Gynema Sylvestre and
          Chromium are all natural regulators of blood sugar levels. The
          can help prevent feeding the infection by keeping blood sugar
          levels normalized.<br>
          <br>
          Olive Leaf and Oregano Leaf are both natural systemic
          antifungal agents.<br>
