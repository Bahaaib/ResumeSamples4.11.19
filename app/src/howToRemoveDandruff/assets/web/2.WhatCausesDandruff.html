          What causes dandruff can be attributed to many different
          factors. Although the cause is not the same for everyone,
          dandruff can be basically defined as a scalp problem that is
          identified by excessive flaking of dead skin tissue. For some
          it can be caused by external factors such as simply using the
          wrong shampoo, washing to often, not washing enough, or
          rinsing their hair in water that is too hot. Some people have
          a skin condition like psoriasis, eczema, or seborrheic
          dermatitis. <br>
          <br>
          A seborrheic dermatitis condition can sometimes be an internal
          factor as well as an external one. For others it is merely
          seasonal and related to cold and dry weather. Whatever the
          individuals cause turns out to be, there are many natural
          remedies to effectively treat each and every problem.<br>
          <br>
          If what causes dandruff for you is related to shampoo usage,
          then I would take a look at the directions and especially the
          ingredients. Most medicated shampoo's contain ingredients that
          can be harmful to the scalp or even worsen the dandruff
          problem. Some people have even reported not having a dandruff
          problem until they accidentally used a medicating shampoo
          intended for dandruff sufferers. <br>
          <br>
          Most people can never fully treat or cure their problem with
          toxic or chemical ingredients present in their chosen
          application. So why use a product that is not natural and can
          potentially harm you? However, some chemical additives in
          dandruff shampoo's are intended to act as an antimicrobial or
          anti-fungal agent. There are many natural and less expensive
          alternatives that are just as effective.<br>
          <br>
          To combat what causes dandruff you can use easily available
          items like apple juice, coconut oil, baking soda, and lemons
          just to name a few. Natural ingredients are surprisingly
          effective at treating what causes dandruff and much less
          expensive than a prepackaged treatment. Those ingredients I
          just mentioned are not to be combined all together but rather
          used independently to make a variety of different remedies to
          treat individual scalp problems. <br>
          <br>
          Although those are only four out of dozens of natural
          ingredients that can be utilized to treat any cause of
          dandruff, you can probably see how inexpensive and easy it is
          to boycott the manufactured dandruff products and just take of
          the problem yourself.<br>
          <br>
          The major and most common culprits to what causes dandruff:<br>
          <br>
          Scalp psoriasis affects many parts of the body, included the
          scalp. The most common form of psoriasis is called psoriasis
          vulgaris. About 80% of people suffering from psoriasis
          actually have psoriasis vulgaris. This condition can vary in
          degree and severity just like any other skin condition. <br>
          <br>
          It is characterized by angry red lesions on the skin with a
          silvery, flaky upper skin layer, and will cause dead skin
          flakes to fall onto your clothes in a similar manner as
          dandruff. Though the most common place on the body to have
          psoriasis vulgaris is on the knees and elbows. So if you have
          dandruff symptoms on your scalp in addition to legions on your
          knees or elbows, your scalp problem is most likely caused by
          psoriasis vulgaris. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; Seborrhoeic dermatitis (sometimes called 'Seborrheic
          eczema') is also a skin disorder affecting the scalp and
          sometimes other parts of the body as well. <br>
          <br>
          Symptoms include flaking, itchy red irritated skin commonly
          found on areas of the body where there is the largest number
          of sebaceous glands. Sebaceous glands secrete sebum, and sebum
          is a naturally occurring oil in the scalp.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;Malassezia yeast is also a naturally occurring fungi
          that is found on the scalp. Malassezia yeast needs to feed on
          the fatty sebum oil secreted by the sebaceous glands.
          Sometimes the human body produces to much sebum and the
          malassezia yeast grows out of control. <br>
          <br>
          If your skin is damaged in any way, like sores or scratches
          from excessive itching, the fungus can gain access into the
          skin, and possibly cause a fungal infection. When this
          happens, there is a biological reaction that increases the
          skin cells renewal process, which produces excess skin cells
          that have no where to go but off your head and onto your
          clothes. Thus producing the most common cause of dandruff. <br>
          <br>
          You can still have an appearance of dandruff whether there is
          a fungal infection present or not.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp; A fungal infection is simply a result of Seborrhoeic
          dermatitis with a break or weak point on the skin of the scalp
          as explained above. If you do in fact have a fungal infection,
          it is most likely to be accompanied by a degree of pain, which
          regular dandruff very rarely is. While either of these
          conditions can be quite persistent, they are both easily dealt
          with using natural means.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;If what causes dandruff for you is seasonal due to cold
          and dry weather, then you have a moisturizing problem.
          Actually a lack of moisture in the scalp. Although this is
          more of a simple case of dry skin rather than dandruff, it can
          still produce dandruff like flakes and at times be quite
          embarrassing. <br>
          <br>
          You could buy a moisturizing cream. Or if you have easy access
          to some aloe vera or even olive oil, that could help. It is
          important to note that there are not many natural remedies
          that can be used as a one size fits all type of treatment. The
          reason for this is because one persons cause of dandruff could
          be completely different from the next. Every persons biology
          is a little different as well. <br>
          <br>
          The important thing to remember is that anyone suffering from
          dandruff, no matter what the cause, can treat and fix the
          problem through natural means.<br>
          <br>
          What else causes dandruff? Diet. Yes diet can play a major
          role as well. For example, if you consume a lot of red meat,
          you are consuming the type of saturated fats that can increase
          sebum secretion. Trans fatty acids found in margarine can also
          have the same effect. <br>
          <br>
          Your intake of vitamins and minerals could change how your
          dandruff problem reacts as well. <br>
          <br>
          Can dietary intake have the same effects and consequences for
          everybody? No.<br>
          <br>
          Absolutely not. Because heredity and individual biological
          make up affect your susceptibility of what will and what will
          not have an effect on your dandruff condition. The same can be
          said for external factors as well. <br>
          <br>
          However, utilizing natural ingredients for your dandruff
          problem will always be healthier than applying any kind
          chemicals to your head.<br>
