          Dandruff affects the scalp and causes the scalp to flake - it
          is a common condition. Our skin cells are continually renewing
          themselves. When the skin cells on our scalp are renewed the
          old ones are pushed to the surface. If you are a person who
          suffers with dandruff the renewal process is faster, making
          the dandruff more of a noticeable problem.<br>
          <br>
          The exact cause of dandruff is not known, although it is
          believed by some professionals to be associated with an
          over-growth of Malassezia, which is a fungus commonly found on
          the skin and scalp. Dandruff can be a long-term problem or it
          can be the result of certain lifestyle changes or stress. If
          you have dandruff you may also notice itching and redness on
          the scalp. Excessive flaking may be caused by an underlying
          illness or condition, such as psoriasis, a fungal infection,
          or even head lice.<br>
          <br>
          Having dandruff can be a real blow to a persons self-esteem,
          knocking ones confidence. Therefore, finding an effective
          treatment for dandruff may be important for both physiological
          and psychological reasons.<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Before we start with the cures and for getting rid of dandruff
          let's have a quick look a some of the steps we can take to
          help prevent dandruff.<br>
          <br>
          When you shampoo your hair, try not to scratch your scalp too
          much.<br>
          <br>
          Try to avoid putting to many chemicals on your hair such as
          hair dye.<br>
          <br>
          Try to manage your stress better. Good quality sleep and
          meditation could help you de-stress.<br>
          <br>
          Brush your hair at least once a day. Shampoo it at least three
          times a week.<br>
          <br>
          Cut down on your use of hair products such as gel and spray
          until your dandruff calms down.<br>
          <br>
          Clean your comb everyday. Try using a good quality barbicide
          (The blue liquid you may have seen your barber or hairdresser
          using to store their combs and clippers etc)<br>
          <br>
          Get more Vitamin B in your diet. Include more seafood, fresh
          vegetables and nuts in your diet.<br>
          <br>
          Don't wash your hair in hard water. If you live in an area
          with hard water, have a filter fitted, or wash your hair with
          bottled water.<br>
          <br>
          Change your shampoo. Sometimes you may be using a shampoo
          which just doesn't agree with your scalp and can actually
          agitate the sebaceous glands and cause dandruff. Once you've
          found a shampoo that works for you, stick with it.<br>
          <br>
          Okay, that's the preventative stuff out of the way... what
          about the cures?<br>

              Naturally</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          For those of you who prefer to do things the natural way there
          are plenty of options available to you. If you prefer to using
          commercially available medicated products instead of going the
          home remedy type route, then you can skip the next few
          paragraphs.<br>
          <br>
          Yogurt makes an excellent hair conditioner. After washing your
          hair, try rubbing some plain yogurt into your scalp. Leave it
          for 10 of 15 minutes to do its stuff. Rinse your hair through
          with a vinegar water mix (you don't need much vinegar, just a
          tablespoon in a bowl of water). After you've rinsed with the
          vinegar water, rinse it again with warm water until it's
          clean. You can then wash your hair through with a little
          shampoo if you wish.<br>
          <br>
          Boil the peels of a lemon or two in 1 liter of water for 15-20
          minutes. Let it cool and rinse your hair with this solution
          about once a week.<br>
          <br>
          Mix the juice of half a lemon with 4 tablespoons of warmed
          olive oil (obviously not hot, just warm. You don't want burn
          yourself). Rub the mixture into the roots before washing your
          hair with a mild shampoo.<br>
          <br>
          Get some boric acid powder. This is available at the chemist
          or online and it is usually used as an eye wash. Warm any
          natural oil such as olive oil, coconut oil or castor oil, add
          one teaspoon of boric powder and allow it to dissolve. Part
          your hair into separate sections and apply the oil and massage
          it well into the scalp. Keep it on for 2-3 hours or ideally
          overnight if you can, and then wash your hair in the morning.
          Do this procedure once a week and if your dandruff is
          stubborn, try it twice a week.<br>
          <br>
          Mix two tablespoons of malt or cider vinegar into a mug of
          warm water. After you have washed your hair and rinsed it of
          shampoo, do a final rinse with this vinegar mix. Do this two
          of three times a week.<br>
          <br>
          Take 2 tablespoons of fenugreek seeds, leave them to soak
          overnight. In the morning grind them into a fine paste. This
          paste should be applied on the scalp and left for half an
          hour. The hair should be then washed thoroughly with mild
          shampoo.<br>
          <br>
          Add a drop of tea tree oil to your regular shampoo. Tea tree
          oil has been used for centuries and is a highly effective
          anti-septic and anti-fungal substance. It's works great to
          combat dandruff.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          If the natural home-remedies aren't helping to get rid of
          dandruff, you might want to try some of the many medicated
          shampoos that are available over the counter, T-Gel and Head
          &amp; Shoulders being two which spring to mind. Try to get a
          trial sized sample of any brand medicated shampoo before
          making a purchasing. Some brands my work better for you than
          some others, because they can be quite harsh some medicated
          shampoos may even worsen your dandruff problem by irritating
          your skin. So shop around until you find one that works.<br>

          If you have tried all the above methods and nothing has seemed
          to work for you it could mean there are underlying problems.
          You may need to speak to a doctor or dermatologist so that
          they can diagnose what the problem is exactly.<br>
