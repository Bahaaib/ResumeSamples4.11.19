      <li><big><big>The first step, and the most important step, in your
            quest
            to lose weight quickly toward achieving rapid weight loss,
            begins with
            your state of mind. Yes, it is your body that needs to slim
            down, but
            it is your mind that needs to take the helm and command your
            body to
            make the paradigm shift from being subjugated to your bodily
            desires to
            being in control, maintaining discipline, regulating your
            body's
            metabolism, and <em>making your goal weight a reality</em>.
            No, this is not some holistic remedy I'm talking about here.
            Nor am I
            talking about hypnosis. I am simply referring to the
            principle of <em>mind
              over matter</em>. I am talking about your mental attitude.
            Success and failure in any endeavor begin and end with the
            mind. You
            must <em>believe</em> that you will lose weight, gain
            muscle mass, and become the new you. You must begin each day
            and end
            each day with positive affirmations that will empower you to
            overcome
            any obstacles, sabotage the saboteurs, and master the art of
            self-discipline. Then and only then will you be able to
            endure the
            journey to rapid <em>and sustainable</em> weight loss. If
            your mind tells you that can't do it, or that it is too
            difficult, or
            that you cannot bear the thought of not eating certain
            comfort foods,
            then you will most undoubtedly fail. But if your mind tells
            you that
            you can do it, you will do, this is the way it has to be,
            you will be
            successful, and nothing will stand in your way, and you will
            make the
            right choices, then you <em>will be successful</em>. So
            mental preparedness is the first step.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Be prepared. Have a plan</b>. Never be at the
            mercy of your
            diet. If you know that you can only eat certain types or
            certain
            quantities of food at certain meal times, then you must <em>be
              proactive</em> and <em>do whatever it takes</em> to
            ensure that <em>that food</em> in <em>that quantity</em>
            is <em>readily available</em> to you <em>at that
              time</em>. Do not be at work or at school, find yourself
            starving, and be within fifty feet of a McDonald's and just
            say "I'm
            starving and the only place where I can get a decent salad
            is at
            Subway, which is ten miles away, but McDonald's is right
            here. Oh well,
            I guess I will just eat at McDonald's." I know from
            experience, because
            that has happened to me. But the right thing to do is either
            prepare
            your meals at home and bring it with you, cook your meals
            ahead of
            time, buy all of the grocery that you will need on your diet
            and make
            sure it is there for you when you need it (you don't want to
            be at home
            and hungry and you don't have the right foods available to
            you at home
            in the fridge because you didn't go grocery shopping). If
            you are going
            to a party or if you know that your boss will be catering
            lunch at
            work, then make sure that you have an idea of what you can
            eat there.
            Otherwise, don't attend it! Or bring your own food, or
            request to order
            your own specialized meal. The important thing is to be
            proactive and
            to be prepared. Stock your fridge. Pack your lunch. Plan
            your day so
            that you know ahead of time where you will eat out and what
            you will
            eat there. Be proactive. Be prepared.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Never starve</b>. The starvation diet will not
            work. Say it
            with me. Say it ten times until it becomes ingrained in your
            subconscious: The starvation diet will not work. What makes
            you think
            that it will? You may believe that by severely limiting your
            caloric
            intake you will lose weight. Yes, it is true that the
            numbers will drop
            on the bathroom scale. But you will lose muscle. You will
            lose energy.
            You will lose willpower. You will lose your motivation to
            continue the
            diet. You will get sick. You will become malnourished. You
            will pay for
            it will a decreased metabolism, which will effectively fight
            against
            you to resist weight loss. So don't do it. Once you lose all
            of your
            weight on the starvation diet, you <em>will gain it all
              back. </em>Even
            if you can tell me that you promise to eat healthy after you
            finish
            starving your weight off, your metabolism will already have
            been slowed
            down, so when you <em>do </em>go back to eating
            "normally" again, your "new normal" will be considered
            "overeating" to
            your body which has gotten <em>used to</em> eating less.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Drink as much water as you can.</b> Water can
            help stave off
            hunger. Water helps to cleanse your digestive system, and
            helps to
            maintain your body's well-being.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Eat foods high in fiber like salads.</b> Have you
            ever noticed
            that none of the fad "quick-fix" diets out there prohibit
            you from
            eating salads during your diet? That's because foods high in
            fiber are
            universally good for you, no matter whether you follow a
            low-calories,
            a low-carb, or a low-fat diet. You have nothing to lose by
            eating
            salads. You won't "use up" too many points on Weight
            Watchers. You
            won't "bust" your Atkins diet carb limits. You definitely
            won't be
            eating fat. If anything, <em>supplement</em> your meals
            with some fiber every day. You will feel satisfied with each
            meal and
            it helps improve your digestion, which is also a key to
            proper
            metabolic consumption and weight loss.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Get as much sleep as you can.</b> In this day and
            age, of
            high-strung, busy, on-the-go lifestyles, people are getting
            less and
            less sleep, due to the momentum of our fast-paced world.
            People are
            trying to accomplish more by sacrificing sleep. Don't do
            that. And
            particularly don't do that if you are trying to lose weight!
            Your body
            goes into maintenance mode while you sleep. Why burden your
            body's
            digestive system when your body should be resting for six to
            eight
            hours (whatever your body needs). Don't short-change your
            sleep. This
            is time that your body is able to rest, regenerate, and
            consume those
            calories.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Do not eat within three hours of going to sleep</b>.
            You don't
            want food to be in your digestive system for the next six to
            eight
            hours do you? Your body slows down during sleep, so that
            means your
            body will take longer to digest your food.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Keep track of your progress. </b>Keep a journal.
            Sometimes
            people do not even realize just how much they are eating or
            what they
            are eating, because we all mindlessly put food into our
            months. Two
            hours later we feel "hungry again" and we eat, completely
            oblivious and
            forgetful to the fact that you just ate a meal two hours
            ago!</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Learn from your mistakes.</b> If you are keeping
            a journal, and
            you make mistakes on your diet, you should learn from your
            mistake,
            pick up the pieces and move on. Do <em>not</em> flail your
            arms and say "Oh well, I guess I'll start over again next
            week". You
            should instead continue where you left off for the rest of
            the day and
            do the best you can to get back on track. If you overspent
            your daily
            allotment of calories, points, or carbs, then just eat
            sensibly for the
            rest of the day, and start fresh tomorrow (or next week),
            whichever is
            the case. Don't just shut down and stop eating for the rest
            of the day
            if you've already exceeded your limit or eat the wrong food
            too early
            during the day. And most importantly, don't just say "Oh
            well, I guess
            I'll just eat whatever I want today and try again tomorrow".</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Space your meals out by at least 3 hours.</b> Eat
            at least 3 to
            4 complete meals every day. You need to give your body time
            to digest
            the food that is already in its stomach before you introduce
            more food
            to it.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Do not skip any meals. </b>If you get really
            hungry, you will
            be tempted to deviate from your diet and eat the wrong
            foods, because
            you won't be able to think rationally about your diet, since
            all you
            want is to eat! So don't starve.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Watch less television.</b> Exercise while
            watching TV. Don't
            just sit on the couch. Studies have shown that people tend
            to snack or
            they keep on eating continuously, reaching for more food,
            while
            watching television and they don't even realize that they
            are doing it.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Hold yourself accountable </b>to a support
            group, a friend,
            family member, a personal trainer, doctor, nutritionist,
            your neighbor,
            your spiritual leader, co-worker, or whoever. When you are
            left alone
            to yourself, it is easy to cheat. It is easy to give up. It
            is easy to
            lack the motivation. But there is something about being
            accountable to
            someone else that makes people stay on task, because they
            are sharing
            their private experience with the world.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Do some sort of exercise daily.</b> It does not
            necessarily
            have to be heavy aerobics or weightlifting, although doing
            these would
            be a huge plus. You can burn calories and gain muscle mass
            simply by
            walking (30 minutes or more per day), bicycling, climbing
            stairs,
            playing sports, or doing basic in-place exercises in front
            of your TV.
            Though it is possible to lose weight without activity, it is
            activity
            that really causes your weight loss to go into high gear.
            It's like the
            equivalent of investing in a savings account versus
            investing in a
            high-yield mutual fund. Your reward is greater if you take
            the risk of
            exercise than if you just keep your money in a savings
            account, which
            still earns you interest but not as quickly and not as much.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Reward yourself.</b> It's okay to splurge on one
            meal here and
            there, but only after you have achieved a certain milestone,
            such as
            ten pounds or twenty pounds, or some other goal. Or rather
            than reward
            yourself with food, reward yourself with a gift or an
            experience, some
            kind of treat or incentive to make it worthwhile. You can
            even go
            shopping for clothes and feel good about your smaller
            clothing size!</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Shut out the negativity and be assertive.</b>
            Don't let the
            naysayers, the jealous people, or the insensitive people who
            are likely
            to (even if unintentionally) sabotage your efforts, get to
            you. Be
            positive and stay in control, stay focused on your
            objective. Cancel
            out the "noise" of skepticism, fear, doubt, and insecurity,
            and make
            your goal a reality. Remember that you are better than that.
            Tell
            yourself that you are not weak. You are strong.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big><b>Pick a diet that makes sense.</b> Some diets work
            well for some
            people and some don't. There are so many dieting strategies
            out there,
            each with their own approach on how to lose weight quickly.
            But you
            need to research and pick a diet plan that you will be
            comfortable
            following, that leaves you feeling satisfied, not allowing
            you to feel
            deprived, that is convenient for your lifestyle, and makes
            the most
            sense to you.</big></big></li>
