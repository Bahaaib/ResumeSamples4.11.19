            Essential Tips You Must Know</span><br>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-weight:
      bold;"><big><big>Who wouldn't like to lose weight fast?</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Whether
you
          want to shed some pounds for an upcoming high school reunion
          or
          just to look good for that upcoming summer beach vacation that
          you
          planned, you want quick weight loss results...now!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>However,
losing
          too much weight too rapidly may not be healthy or good for
          your
          body. Granted, things like diet pills, fad diets or starvation
          diets
          may enable you to shed those pounds rapidly, but you have to
          know that
          these methods of weight loss can actually harm your heart (not
          good)
          and your other internal organs (even worse) as well.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>As
          such, try not to lose too much weight too quickly. Rather,
          follow these
          practical guidelines and you'll be able to lose weight safely,
          naturally and as fast as possible:</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><strong><em>1</em></strong>)<strong><em>
              <u>Write Down Everything You Eat</u></em></strong></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>To
          lose weight, you have to expend more calories than you
          consume. To
          achieve this "calorie deficit", you either have to start
          consuming less
          calories or you'll have to start getting some exercise to burn
          more
          calories. Of course, it will be best if you can do both.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Coming
          back to the point, writing down whatever you're eating makes
          it easier
          for you to track the total number of calories you're consuming
          a day,
          which in turn enables you to decide which foods you can eat
          less of or
          even avoid completely.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Remember
to
          include the little things like the amount of butter you're
          spreading
          on your morning toast, the spoonfuls of sugar in your coffee,
          the salad
          dressing on your salad...etc.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>You
          can do this by reading the food labels or looking up the many
          websites
          available nowadays which can easily show you the calorie
          counts of
          different foods.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>2) <u><strong><em>Run
                Through Your List</em></strong></u></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Have a
          glance at your list and see what foods can be eliminated or
          reduced.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>For
          example, if you drink a tall, full cream latte for breakfast
          every
          morning, you can consider switching to a hot cup of black
          coffee
          instead. Doing so may save you 500 calories every day, and
          over a week,
          that adds up to about 3,500 calories, which is equivalent to
          losing a
          pound a week.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Or
          maybe it's the soda pop that you're drinking, or that
          afternoon candy
          bar. Or maybe it's just that you're a carb person and eat too
          much of
          refined carbs like bread, pasta or rice.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>All
          these foods are high in sugar (or in the case of the refined
          carbs,
          easily converted to sugar) and reducing them in your diet will
          help you
          to lose weight much faster.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Instead,
try
          and eat more lean meat and protein like grilled chicken or
          fish.
          Fish like salmon, sardines, mackerel or albacore tuna are
          excellent as
          not only are they high in protein, they are also rich in
          antioxidants
          and Omega-3 Fatty Acids. Try and eat fish at least twice a
          week.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>As
          mentioned, reduce the number of refined carbs you're eating -
          instead
          of a side of fries, pasta, rice or potatoes, try having a
          fresh garden
          salad with reduced or no-calorie dressing instead.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>3) <strong><em><u>Plan
                Your Meals And Eat Frequently Throughout The Day</u></em></strong></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>After
          knowing which foods you have to eat (or avoid) to lose weight,
          you have
          to start planning your meals and preparing them in advance.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>This
          helps in two ways - firstly, you will be able to buy exactly
          what you
          need at the supermarket without being tempted to buy foods
          that are
          unhealthy; and secondly, you will not be tempted to eat a
          'sinful' meal
          like a double cheeseburger with extra fries if you already
          have your
          meals planned and prepared in advance.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Try
          to eat about 5 to 6 small meals a day, spread throughout the
          day. Three
          of these meals can be main meals consisting of lean protein
          like
          chicken, fish or eggs and a fresh salad or vegetables. The
          remaining
          meals can be snacks like a cup of natural yogurt with fresh
          fruit or a
          handful of almonds.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          reason for eating frequently is because the process of
          digesting solid
          food is actually thermogenic and will cause your metabolic
          rate to
          increase.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>4) <em><u><strong>Drink
                Plenty Of Water</strong></u></em></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Drinking
enough
          water is essential to both good health and weight loss and
          chances are, you're not drinking enough of it. Besides, if
          your body is
          dehydrated, it will start retaining water and usually in the
          most
          unflattering of places! Drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of
          water a day,
          more if you're physically active.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>5) <strong><em><u>Get
                Some Exercise</u></em></strong></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Although
there's
          no doubting the importance of a solid and nutritious diet for
          fast weight loss, you'll have to get some exercise as well for
          quicker
          weight loss.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>However,
          make sure that your workout is intense enough or you're just
          wasting your time.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Try
          and incorporate cardio and resistance training utilizing the
          HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) principles.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>A
          HIIT style workout not only burns calories during your workout
          but
          importantly, also causes your metabolism to be revving high
          even hours
          after your workout.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Resistance
training
          is also important (whether you're a male or female) as
          building lean muscle on your body causes your resting
          metabolic rate to
          <br>
          increase.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Studies
have
          shown that consistent weight training can cause a person's
          metabolic rate to increase by almost 15%! This means without
          doing
          anything else, an average person can burn an extra 200 - 300
          calories a
          day at rest just by adding lean muscle mass onto their frame.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Ladies,
don't
          worry that resistance training and/or muscle building will
          make
          you look bulkier though. Don't be fooled by pictures you see
          on the
          covers of bodybuilding magazines as those professional
          bodybuilders are
          at the top of the gene pool when it comes to building muscle
          or they
          are pumped full of anabolic steroids anyway.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>In
          fact, building lean muscle makes you look more streamlined and
          lean as muscle takes up less space than fat.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>6) <strong><em><u>Get
                Enough Rest Between Workouts</u></em></strong></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Make
          sure you get enough rest between your resistance training
          workouts. You
          have to understand that muscles only rebuild themselves and
          get
          stronger only while you are at rest, so try to get at least a
          day's
          rest between your workouts.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Also,
          make sure you get enough sleep at night as well. Not getting
          enough sleep may also impede your ability to burn fat.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>7) <em><strong><u>Be
                Patient, Disciplined And Consistent!</u></strong></em></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Be
          patient! You didn't put on that excess weight in a day so
          you'll have
          to be realistic and realize that weight loss will not happen
          overnight
          as well.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Be
          disciplined in your approach to weight loss and that means
          consistently
          sticking to your diet and exercise plan no matter what. No
          excuses!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So
