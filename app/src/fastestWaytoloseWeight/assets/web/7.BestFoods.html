            Way Fast - Here Are The Best Foods For Healthy Weight Loss!</span><br>
        </big></big>
      By John D. Miller</p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          human body is
          like a machine: it needs energy in order to work. This energy
          is known
          as calories. Often, however, we assimilate more calories than
          we are
          capable of burning, often due to lack of exercise and a
          sedentary
          lifestyle. This causes us to put on weight.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Many
          of us are so desperate to lose this excessive weight that are
          willing
          to follow fad diets, which only work in the short run and
          damage our
          health. Healthy weight loss is the only option that makes any
          sense, if
          you want to lose pounds and keep them off.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So,
          what is healthy weight loss?</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Firstly,
eating
          more raw foods can be a very healthy way to lose weight. "Live
          foods" can increase vitality, strengthen the defenses of the
          immune
          system, regulate your weight and slow down the aging process
          of the
          cells. Foods such as millet, quinoa sprouts, alfalfa, aloe
          Vera, barley
          grass, wild blue-green algae, flax, parsley, sunflower and
          stevia can
          be included in your daily diet and solve many problems like
          chronic
          fatigue, gastric pain, bloating, indigestion, nausea,
          allergies and
          severe headaches. They are rich in vitamins and minerals,
          contain the
          right amount of protein, have lots of complex carbohydrates
          that give
          your body more energy, are low in fat and contain lots of
          fiber that
          helps to lower bad cholesterol. Cooking these foods will
          denature
          proteins, oxidize fats, destroy vitamins and generate free
          radicals and
          toxins. But eating them raw forces the body to absorb all the
          nutrients
          and nourishes all the organs, especially the endocrine system,
          pancreas, liver, kidneys and spleen.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>More
          specifically, here are the foods that can help you lose fat
          the healthy way:</big></big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Seaweed: seaweed has an extraordinary concentration
            of minerals,
            including calcium and iodine. Iodine benefits the thyroid
            gland, which
            helps in the assimilation of food, regulates water levels in
            the body
            and reduces excess fat. Also many studies suggest that
            seaweed can
            reduce cholesterol.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Stevia: it is a South American plant whose green
            leaves are used as
            a sweetener. It contains minerals and vitamins A and C.
            Stevia doesn't
            raise blood sugar levels, like fructose and sugar and
            reduces the
            appetite and the desire for sweet foods.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Sunflower: the seeds of this plant are rich in
            vitamins A and E,
            antioxidants, beneficial fatty acids, and substances that
            help the
            liver to remove fats from the blood. Sunflower seeds contain
            B vitamins
            that nourish the adrenal glands. People who are deficient in
            B
            vitamins, do not produce the right amount of hormones and
            suffer from
            low energy.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Blue-green algae: this algae converts sunlight into
            chlorophyll. It
            contains vitamins, amino acids and minerals, particularly
            beta-carotene
            and protein. The proteins of blue-green algae are rich in
            peptides,
            which are neurotransmitters that nourish the brain and the
            nervous
            system by improving mental clarity and memory. Also
            consuming algae
            increases the sperm count and improves sexual performance.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Millet: it is a grain whose taste resembles that of
            potato. It does
            not contain gluten, so it can be consumed even by people who
            have
            gluten intolerance. Millet is an alkaline food that
            neutralizes the
            excessive gastric acidity, a condition that can lead to
            arthritis or
            gout. In addition, the enzymes in millet facilitate
            digestion. Also
            millet is rich in silica, which is essential for the health
            of
            connective tissue, bones and arteries.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Buds: they are the seeds of legumes and cereals.
            They are rich in vitamins, minerals, enzymes and proteins.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Aloe Vera: this cactus-like medicinal plant contains
            vitamins,
            minerals, salicylic acid and plant hormones. The glucomannan
            in aloe
            speeds up the healing of wounds and its plant hormones
            promote the
            production of new cells and stimulate the formation of
            collagen in the
            connective tissue. Also aloe has an anti-inflammatory action
            in the
            stomach and intestines that lasts for up to 48 hours.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Alfalfa: it contains all the vitamins and minerals
            necessary for
            life. It contains 40 bioflavonoids with antioxidant and
            anti-inflammatory properties and the leaves are rich in
            beta-carotene
            and vitamin C, which is valuable for the immune system.
            Alfalfa is a
            good source of Vitamin K, which helps the blood flow and
            prevents
            hypercholesterolemia. For these reasons, alfalfa is
            considered an
            anti-aging food.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Quinoa looks like a cereal, but is actually a fruit
            that is cooked
            like rice. It can help you replace meat, because its
            proteins contain
            all the amino acids that are essential to health. Unlike
            meat, it
            doesn't contain saturated fats or harmful nitrogen waste
            that burdens
            the kidneys. Moreover quinoa cleanses the liver from
            chemicals.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Barley is rich in the antioxidant enzyme SOD
            (superoxide
            dismutase). If you eat too many processed foods or have been
            exposed to
            smog, toxins and radiation, then barley can help you
            eliminate all the
            harmful free radicals from your body. What is more, SOD
            protects you
            from the aging that is caused by the radicals. Additionally,
            the
            superoxide dismutase has stronger anti-inflammatory
            properties than
            cortisone or aspirin.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Linseeds: they contain a substantial amount of
            fiber, and are the
            richest source of omega 3 fatty acids. Omega 3s regulate
            blood
            pressure, lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease. Also
            the fiber
            content of flaxseeds helps to fight hypertension.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Parsley: this herb is very rich in vitamin C, beta
            carotene and
            fluoride, which protects the health of the bones and teeth.
            The
            chlorophyll is present in abundance inside parsley and can
            help fight
            against fungi and bacteria, relieve inflammation, protect
            the stomach
            and intestines from harmful organisms, fight viruses and
            help the lungs
            to get rid of toxins caused by air pollution. It also helps
            to
            eliminate toxins from the kidneys, liver and bladder.</big></big></li>

        </big></big>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Here
          are a few more foods that can slow down the absorption of fats
          and help the body get rid of toxins:</big></big></p>
    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Apple: they aid digestion and are rich in calcium,
            iron, phosphorus and potassium that help the body fight
            water retention.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Kiwi is an excellent source of vitamin C that
            protects the capillaries and stimulates the bowel.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Carrot regulates the intestinal function and is a
            diuretic.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Artichoke facilitates the digestion of fats.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Yogurt can balance the intestinal flora.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Fennel is low in calories and can detoxify the body
            through urination.</big></big></li>
      <big><big>
        </big></big>
      <li><big><big>Whole grains help the normal bowel function and have
            a high satiating power.</big></big></li>

    <ul style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
      <big><big>

    </ul>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small><a
          target="_new"
          href="http://caralluma-fimbriata-extract.blinkweb.com/">Caralluma
          fimbriata</a>
        is another very effective appetite suppressant. Most of the
        species of
        Caralluma occur in Africa. Controlled clinical tests have
        demonstrated
        its capacity to control food consumption, by affecting the
        hunger
        control mechanism of the brain.</small></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><small>Every
        time we eat enough food, the stomach sends a signal to the
        hypothalamus
        in the brain to cease eating, because the stomach is full.
        Caralluma
        fimbriata extract seems to be able to fool the brain into
        thinking that
        your stomach is full, even if you have not eaten anything.
        Caralluma
        also acts by blocking one enzyme called Malonyl Coenzyme A. This
        can
        also <a target="_new"
          href="http://caralluma-fimbriata-extract.blinkweb.com/">block
          fat formation</a>
        and force the body to burn its fat reserves. This extract can
        indirectly increase muscle mass. Caralluma inhibits fat
        synthesis, so
        if there is a lot of energy available to the body that can not
        be
        stored as fat, then this energy may become accessible to the
        muscles.</small></p>
