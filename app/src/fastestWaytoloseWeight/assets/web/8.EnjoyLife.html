    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>We
          would love to
          know how to lose weight fast, wouldn't we? And we all
          appreciate that
          we have been told to eat sensibly and do a little more
          exercise. Now,
          we would all be slim and perfectly happy if that was all there
          was to
          it, wouldn't we? Let's face it, we are looking for something
          more than
          simply being to eat less and run around the park for an hour
          every day!
          Let's get real, OK?</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I
          lost weight over twenty years and I've kept it off. I didn't
          do it by
          following any fad diet or hyped up scheme. Let me give you
          some of my
          tips for getting that weight off and keeping it off. Oh, and
          let's keep
          you happy and enjoying your food too! Here are a few things
          that you
          can do to get losing weight fast.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Following
these
          top tips will help you get that weight off, keep it off and
          feel
          good about yourself. Read on because I have an essential tip
          to help
          you to achieve fast weight loss included below.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>1.
          Stop starving yourself.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>People
          eat a very light lunch, for instance, and they end up feeling
          so hungry
          that they dive in for a fatty treat a couple of hours later. A
          good
          example is the office worker who buys a healthy salad for
          lunch because
          he or she has promised themselves that they can eat a light
          lunch and
          get through the day. The trouble is that by 3pm they are
          absolutely
          starving and head straight for the snack bars or chocolate.
          Disaster!
          Eat enough to fill you up a little at each meal.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>My
          favorite way of doing this is to eat some fruit before my
          lunch, then
          again afterwards. I can then eat something fairly healthy,
          like a
          chicken and salad sandwich, and I feel just enough full to not
          get
          starving hungry a couple of hours later. In fact, I normally
          eat three
          pieces of fruit with my lunch. I find that apples, pears and
          bananas
          are really good at filling me up. I have also found that
          munching on
          some celery or carrot is a great way to fill up, too. All of
          this fruit
          and veg mean that I eat only two slices of bread rather than
          four. And
          that makes a huge difference to my calorie and fat intake. Try
          it. It
          works!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>2.
          It's good to eat between meals</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Remember
your
          parents saying that you must not eat between meals because it
          will
          ruin your appetite? Well, there were right! It's a great idea
          to ruin
          your appetite by eating between meals because you will feel
          less
          temptation to over eat at meal times.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          trick, though, is to eat the right sort of snacks. Avoid
          chocolate
          bars, crisps, and even those "healthy" cereal bars. There are
          too many
          calories, fat and sugar in them. You should snack on fruit
          (yes, more
          of the stuff!), vegetables like celery, carrots, dried fruit,
          unsalted
          rice cakes, Ice cubes made from fruit juice, oatcakes,
          Unsalted or
          unsweetened popcorn or frozen lower fat yoghurt, for example.
          You can
          even put a piece of fruit in some lower fat yoghurt, if you
          wish. Apart
          from the fact that you will be avoiding building up a big
          hunger that
          you will want to satisfy, snacking on healthy foods maintains
          a regular
          blood glucose level and also keeps your metabolism elevated a
          little.
          Good news all around!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>3.
          Begin to develop an exercise pattern - but keeping it simple
          is best!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Do
          you want to know a secret? My first effort at ding exercise
          involved me
          doing no more than going for a walk around the block! And I'm
          talking
          only a very small block that took me about ten minutes to
          complete at a
          very easy pace!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>My
          point is that you should commence an easy and "doable"
          exercise
          programme. Forget about pounding the streets at 6am for a
          five-mile run
          or going to the gym for a blistering 60 minute workout. Just
          do
          something active that you like.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>One
          thing I have often done is to pop my favorite tunes onto my
          MP3 player
          and go for a walk just before I eat lunch. I normally eat a
          banana
          about half an hour beforehand so that I can resist the
          temptation to
          eat my lunch first. Then I just go for a nice stroll and
          listen to some
          music for hour an hour or so. This give me a refreshing change
          of
          environment and I get to listen to music which I something I
          struggle
          to do otherwise.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I
          have found that doing this just three times a week or so have
          made a
          dramatic difference to my health and well-being. I really feel
          a lot
          better when I've done it a few times during the course of a
          couple of
          weeks.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>My
          other
          favourite exercises have been cycling and swimming. I built up
          to these
          over a period so do not feel pressured to do anything too
          dramatic too
          quickly. Just build up to whatever you want as and when you
          wish.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>However,
          those little walks will help you to burn calories and lose
          more weight more quickly. So, go do it!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>5. Set
          yourself a goal</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Yes,
          I know that you have heard it before but it is well worth
          having a goal
          of some sort in mind. It can help to get you through those
          times when
          temptation is near. The normal goals that people talks about
          are
          getting slimmer in time for your wedding, someone else's
          wedding, a
          birthday, or in time for Christmas or a holiday. And those are
          all fine
          and worthy of consideration.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>But
          there are other goals, too.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Here
          are some that I have in mind when I want to motivate myself to
          eat properly:</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>* I
          want to feel healthier because I always feel happier that way
          and I enjoy life a lot better.
          <br>
          * I would to be healthier so that I can live longer and enjoy
          life for many more years.
          <br>
          * My children need me so I need to be healthy so I can spend
          time with them and be around them for a long time to come.
          <br>
          * I want to be slim and avoid health problems like some of my
          family experienced.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Can
          you see the difference? I have added to the normal time
          deadline goal
          idea by having on going goals. Now, the downside to these are
          that
          there is no definite date whereby I achieve my weight loss
          target.
          However, I find these types of motivators to work very well
          for me
          because they deal with real life and serious matters. I really
          am
          concerned about my children being able to rely on me for as
          long as
          possible and I really have found that this has meant that I
          have
          avoided going for extra large helpings of chocolate cake when
          given the
          chance!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I have
          also discovered that having several "big issue" motivators
          like these
          all thought and ready to hand are great at building up several
          lines of
          defence when the temptation comes my way.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Sort
          out your "big issue" motivators and have them in your mind
          when you
          need to be strong. The picture of my kids in my head and me
          being
          beside them has helped me on numerous occasions. This approach
          can help
          you, too, and I've never seen anyone mention it anywhere
          before.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Now,
          one of my big secrets about how to lose weight fast. Start
          today.
          Really, it's that simple. Please, do not have one last big
          meal or
          spend your time researching and planning. Just get on with
          losing
          weight today. Take a walk right now. There you go - you've
          started!</big></big></p>
