    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><em><u><strong>Diet
                Forums.</strong></u></em></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Read
          our diet tips below on how to lose weight, increase metabolism
          and plan
          healthy diets. Diet pep is a formula specifically formulated
          to
          increase the metabolism of fat in the body. It is supposed to
          work
          together with a low-carbohydrate diet in order to raise ones
          energy
          level and fire up metabolism. Diet soda is not a good
          substitute, as it
          contains artificial sweeteners which can affect brain
          chemistry, mood
          and excitability. The best choice is black, green or white
          tea.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><em><u><strong>Dietary
                Regimens.</strong></u></em></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Dietary
regimens
          that are extremely restrictive may produce weight loss results
          in the short term, but are certainly not healthy or practical
          over the
          long term. Diets have long been promoted as a "cure" for
          obesity. If
          any other treatment for a medical problem had a success rate
          of only 5
          percent, it would be pronounced a failure, not a cure. The
          information
          presented on this site is for general use only and is not
          intended to
          provide personal medical advice or substitute for the advice
          of your
          physician.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><em><u><strong>Dietary
                Advice.</strong></u></em></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Dietary
advice
          is based on scientific and medical data and advice from our
          nutrition experts. Diet restrictions after recovery from
          surgery depend
          in part on the type of surgery. Many patients will need to
          take a daily
          multivitamin pill for life to compensate for reduced
          absorption of
          essential nutrients after their surgery. Diet control and
          exercise are
          the things which when implemented into your life can help you
          lose
          weight rapidly and effectively.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><u><em><strong>Add
                Good Fats</strong></em></u>.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Add
          good fats to your diet. Monounsaturated fats have been
          clinically
          proven to help you burn fat, especially in your midsection.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><u><em><strong>Walking.</strong></em></u></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Walking
is
          more important for people in sedentary jobs. Walk for at least
          45
          minutes every day; it helps in burning extra calories. Walk at
          a brisk
          pace (approximately 5kph or 3mph) for 20 to 30 minutes for at
          least 3-4
          days per week. Walking to long distance daily and jogging and
          cycling
          also help to lose weight. Walk up the stairs, instead of
          taking the
          elevator. Tap your foot when you're sitting and walk instead
          of driving
          to the corner store.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><u><em><strong>Eat
                6 small meals</strong></em></u></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Eat
          6 small meals in a day about every 4 hours. This will increase
          your
          metabolism, which will enhance your energy level and will not
          allow fat
          deposition. Eating the low GI way to lose weight is easier
          because you
          don't have to go hungry and what you end up with is true fat
          release.
          Low GI foods act as natural appetite suppressants, are
          filling, prevent
          hunger pangs for longer and boost metabolism so that weight
          loss is
          quick. Eating too much or not being physically active enough
          will make
          you overweight. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat
          must
          equal the energy you burn.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Eating
          more while losing weight?, Yes, it certainly does work!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Eat
          veggies raw, fresh or cooked. No fats, no sauces, no butter.
          Eat your
          soup at least once. Eat more smaller meals throughout the day
          to stop
          yourself from getting that hungry. Eating less than usual but
          balanced
          diet is very crucial-one can reduce the amount of butter or
          margarine
          you take. Once one starts her plan, it is necessary to weigh
          oneself
          after say a week and keeping records. Eating breakfast
          everyday is a
          big part of losing weight. In fact, this is what successful
          weight
          losers do.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Eat to
          lose weight. Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it?</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><u><em><strong>Weight
                Loss Struggle</strong></em></u></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Weight
          loss is often a struggle, because you naturally want to see
          dramatic
          results quickly. Those infomercial solutions aren't usually
          healthy,
          though. Weight loss is a difficult job. You need expert
          guidance.
          Weight loss programs like the Atkins Diet, South Beach Diet,
          Weight
          Watchers and Jenny Craig are not only expensive but many times
          you must
          buy special meals and dietary supplements with the program.
          While you
          can lose weight and lose belly fat, the progress is usually
          very slow
          fat weight loss over a longer period of time.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><u><em><strong>The
                Most Effective Products</strong></em></u></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Weight
          Depot.com is dedicated to helping our customers find the most
          effective
          and natural products to lose weight. We continuously scour the
          market
          to find diet pills and weight loss products that are safe,
          natural and
          effective! Weight that is lost rapidly is usually a mixture of
          water,
          muscle, and a little fat instead of mainly fat. What's worse,
          I found
          with almost all diets that losing was followed by regaining of
          the
          weight. Weight loss is a struggle for many people. Jobs
          require people
          to work odd hours, busy schedules keep families from sitting
          down
          together at the dinner table, and fast food restaurants tempt
          us with
          cheap and tasty foods.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Weight
          loss is the key to reduce the risk of Heart Disease.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>This
          may be the number one reason people choose to do a
          detoxification
          cleanse. Whether you do a full 10 day cleanse, like the
          Lemonade
          Cleanse, or a 24 hour cleanse once a week, you are likely to
          experience
          a weight loss of anywhere to a couple of pounds to 20 pounds
          or more.
          Weight loss means you actually lose weight, but if you want to
          lose fat
          is not the same thing as losing weight. The truth is you're
          not
          overweight genetically.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Changing
my
          schedule to work out in the morning really helped me. I got a
          metabolism boost, I ate less because the work out energized me
          and I
          didn't feel like I needed a bunch of food to be awake, and I
          feel great
          in the mornings now, rather than groggy. Changing your
          lifestyle is the
          way to do this. Change your way of being and you will see
          results fast
          and effortlessly. I don't say its extremely easy because I
          know it
          isn't.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Programs
like
          Jenny Craig are relatively stringent in their requirements.
          Some
          programs are also expensive and require you to buy specialized
          foods.
          Programs that really work usually are willing to give you a
          refund if
          you don't get the results that you want.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big><u><em><strong>Healthy
                Eating Choices</strong></em></u></big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Healthy
eating
          choices can make a huge difference in how you feel. Good
          healthy
          eating choices do more than fuel our bodies. Healthy weight
          management
          can be one of the most complicated health concerns and its
          often only
          through a serious look at your life can you determine what is
          leading
          to weight gain and the frustrations of dieting. Of course a
          lack of
          exercise and an unhealthy diet is going to lead to weight gain
          but even
          the most avid exerciser and serious dieter can struggle to
          lose weight
          at times.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Exercising
is
          inevitable to lose weight. Exercise all you want but this is
          not the
          determinant of how much pounds or fat that you can burn.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Instead,
it
          means eating more fruits and vegetables, because it is not
          concerned
          with calories, but with restoring the proper pH balance in
          your body.
          When you eat high acidic foods, the body produces fat to
          "stick" to the
          acidic molecules in an attempt to restore alkalinity. Instead
          of
          thinking about food and how hungry you are you will be focused
          on what
          you know will Get You Thin Now and Keep You Thin Now! Instead
          your body
          goes after the muscular cells.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Instead,
          they jump on their video games or spend time surfing the
          Internet and chatting with friends or others.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So in
          closing I hope this advice helps you lose weight fast.<br>
