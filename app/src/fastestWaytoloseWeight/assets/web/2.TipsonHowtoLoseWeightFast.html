    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Do you
          need to lose weight fast?</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>It's
          not that hard to have a great weight loss result, just follow
          my 7 easy
          diet tips. You simply need to learn about what you eat and
          apply
          sensible eating habits to make sure you enjoy your food. Yes
          it will
          have to be healthy food, and you need to identify those foods
          that are
          healthy AND that you have forgotten that you love. You do not
          need to
          sacrifice your enjoyment of food! Simply read my tips on how
          to lose
          weight fast. This is a carefully thought out plan with built
          in
          flexibility, and you can use it for as long as you wish.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>1.
          Make a list of everything that you eat and drink for a couple
          of days.
          If you can do it for a week. There is no need to record
          calories, just
          focus on keeping an accurate record of what you eat and drink
          and how
          much of it.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>2.
          Identify all of the areas that you use fats like butter,
          margarine,
          mayonnaise and sauces. Then make a commitment to cutting your
          usage in
          half. And that includes your cooking oils as well.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>3.
          Have a look at when you consume treats like chocolates, ice
          cream,
          cakes, pastries and cookies. We are looking for all the high
          sugar
          stuff.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>This
          is
          likely to be the place you can make the most out of your
          efforts to
          lose weight fast. Try and identify with the reasons why you
          snack on
          these types of high sugar products. Do you justify them as a
          "get you
          over the hump" food?</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If
          so then you need to understand that products containing high
          levels of
          sugar are "high GI" foods, and that your body digests them
          really fast
          which leads to a very short term boost in energy followed by
          your body
          craving another boost.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>And
          if you don't feed your craving then you actually go into a
          short term
          depressed state until that craving is satisfied. This is not
          helping
          your attempts to lose weight.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          best solution for this is firstly to accept that this type of
          snacking
          is really bad for you. Note; snacking is not bad for you, just
          the type
          of snacking. Secondly, bring yourself down from the high low
          syndrome
          over the course of a week or two. Just replace each snack with
          a
          slightly lower sugar content product each day.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>For
          example if you currently eat a donut with your morning cup of
          coffee
          that has two sugars, change that to a piece of raisin toast
          with butter
          and cinnamon (not cinnamon and sugar) and cut the sugar in
          your coffee
          to 1 and 3/4. Do that for a couple of days. Then on the 4th
          day just
          put a very small amount of butter on your raisin toast with
          cinnamon
          and cut the sugar in your coffee to 1 and 1/2.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>As
          your goal after 7 to 10 days, you might be having a cup of
          coffee with
          1 sugar and wholemeal toast with no butter and your favourite
          spread
          like jam, honey or even a light spread of peanut butter.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>By
          doing this with the two or three high sugar snacks you are
          having, you
          will dramatically lower the calories you are consuming,
          increase your
          bodies benefit from the snack by lowering the GI level, and
          all while
          maintaining your enjoyment of the snack!!!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>4.
          Take a look at your main evening meal as well as when you eat
          it.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If
          you like to eat chicken with the skin and stuffing, or your
          red meat
          with a good bit of fat on it, then look at ways you can have
          your cake
          and eat it.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Firstly
if
          you prepare your own foods, start to cut say a third of the
          fat off
          before you cook it and throw it away. If you buy this type of
          meal from
          a take away store do this as you are serving or ask the store
          to do it
          for you. Increase the amount of fat you take away over a week
          or two.
          Your goal might be to only leave 10-20% of the fat or skin on.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Secondly
if
          you tend to eat very close to bed time, try to move the meal
          to a
          slightly earlier time frame. This will help the quality of
          your sleep
          and also the efficiency of your digestive system.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>5.
          If you consume a lot of meat, introduce an extra lunch and
          dinner that
          does not include meat. Use whole grains, vegetables and beans
          to
          increase fiber and reduce fat. If this is not palatable to you
          then add
          some soy sauce, sweet chilly sauce or other low sugar but
          tasty sauce
          to spice up the flavor and enjoyment.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>6.
          Lower the fat content in your dairy consumption. There are
          plenty of
          alternatives that if introduced carefully will not reduce your
          enjoyment.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Try
          buying what you normally use and mix 1/3 of a low fat
          alternative. So
          when you have your cereal put a small amount of the low fat
          milk in
          first and then top it up with your normal milk. Gradually
          increase the
          amount of the low fat variety to allow your taste buds to get
          used to
          the very slightly different taste.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>7.
          Watch what you drink. If you are like most people who are
          concerned
          about their weight, you have already switched to the diet
          version of
          your favorite "bubbly" drink.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>In
          a nutshell, this is not helping. The manufacturers just put a
          heap of
          chemicals in to help make the stuff taste good. And lets face
          it when
          you first swapped over I will bet you did not like it anyway.
          But you
          persisted because you were convinced you needed you can of
          coke!!!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So
          if you can go through that process, surely you can go through
          a process
          of switching into a Non soda type of flavored drink, and
          subsequently
          into a healthy flavored drink and perhaps even just plain old
          water.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Alcohol;
there
          are two issues here, the first one is from a weight loss point
          of
          view and the second one is the addictive nature of alcohol.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I
          will address the second issue first and very briefly. this
          article is
          ONLY about weight loss, while there are many addictive
          qualities to
          foods, particularly high sugar foods, those can mostly be
          overcome by a
          simple and gradual reduction and or replacement process. An
          addiction
          to alcohol is an entirely different thing and can not be
          addressed in
          this article.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          first issue is about how alcohol affects your weight, and it
          has two effects.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          first is that most alcoholic drinks are generally high in
          calories. The
          second is that the consumption of alcohol increases the desire
          to eat.
          So it goes simply to state that if you can reduce your alcohol
          intake
          in either volume or by drinking a low alcohol version, this
          WILL help
          your weight loss.<br>
