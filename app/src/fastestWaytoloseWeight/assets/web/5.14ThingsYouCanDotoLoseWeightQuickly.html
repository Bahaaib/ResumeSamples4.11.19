    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Everyone
          wants to
          know how to lose weight fast. We know the usual "watch your
          diet and
          exercise regularly" routine. But if it is as simple as that,
          then there
          wouldn't be so many fat people in this world!</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Amidst
          all the lies and hype surrounding the weight loss industry, it
          can be
          hard to separate the hype and lies from the truth. That's why
          in
          today's article, I'm going to share with you 14 things you
          must do to
          lose weight fast. Following these 14 tips will help you to
          lose weight
          safely and stay lean all year-round.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>WARNING:
          SOME OF THE INFORMATION YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ MAY CONTRADICT
          WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #1: Stop eating only salads</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>This
          is a well-known habit especially among female office workers.
          You order
          a big salad with nothing but greens. Your colleagues see what
          you eat
          and applaud your efforts to lose weight. But before 2pm, you
          get hungry
          and start looking for cookies and chocolates to snack. How's
          that for
          one step forward and two steps back in your fat loss attempt?
          While
          there's nothing wrong with having salads for lunch, you should
          add some
          good clean protein such as eggs and chicken breasts and also
          good fats
          such as avocados or guacamole into your salads as well.
          Remember this:
          Every meal should have a protein element. These protein and
          fat make
          you feel more satisfied after the meal and will sustain your
          blood
          sugar levels for a longer period so you won't be looking for
          unhealthy
          snacks around the office right after lunch.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #2: Replace all the unhealthy snacks at
          home and in your office</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Contrary
to
          popular belief, snacking is actually productive for fat loss.
          Snacking on healthy snacks in between meals will help maintain
          a steady
          blood glucose level and also keep your metabolism elevated.
          Since
          people snack on convenience and the general availability of
          food around
          them, it is important to keep only healthy snacks such as dark
          chocolate, nuts, trail mixes, fruits or even beef jerky within
          easy
          reach. Throw all the others away. Or give them to a colleague
          you hate.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #3: Start a simple exercise routine</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Every
          fat loss program needs to have an exercise component. It
          doesn't even
          have to an actual exercise like jogging or swimming. If you
          have never
          exercised before in your life, you can even start something as
          simple
          as brisk walking every day for 20 minutes and work up the
          intensity
          from there. The main objective is staying active and turning
          up your
          metabolism. As you get fitter (and you will), crank up the
          intensity
          and challenge your body to reach new heights of fitness.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #4: Stop the steady state jogging</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If
          you have been jogging for some time and haven't seen any
          significant
          weight loss results, then it's time for you to move on to more
          challenging exercises. Jogging is a good exercise to build
          your
          cardiovascular endurance, but not the best for fat loss. To
          effective
          burn fat, you need a workout that elevates your heart rate to
          at least
          80% of your maximum heart rate and burns the most number of
          calories in
          the shortest period of time. Full body exercises such as
          burpees,
          squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses and rows gives you the
          most bang
          for your time spent on exercising. Perform each exercise for
          30 seconds
          with a 30 second break in between for 3 sets before moving
          onto the
          next. Do this for 10 - 15 minutes a day and you will see
          results beyond
          what you have experienced from months of jogging.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #5: Don't avoid carbohydrates completely</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>When
          carbs replaced fats as the main contributor of weight gain,
          many people
          are avoiding all known types of carbs completely. I personally
          have a
          colleague who shuns carbs like the plague. Let me set the
          record
          straight. Not all carbs are bad. Our bodies need carbs to
          function
          properly. Carbs are our bodies' main source of energy. In
          fact, our
          brain functions primarily on carbs. Depriving your body of
          carbs can
          have detrimental effects on your body. Every type food has its
          time and
          place to be consumed. As a general rule, you should only
          consume low
          glycemic carbs such as brown rice, dark leafy vegetables,
          multi-grain
          bread, oatmeal, etc. High glycemic foods such as bananas,
          juices, white
          rice, potatoes and other processed foods are best consumed
          only right
          after an intense exercise.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #6: Set realistic and measurable goals</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>A
          lot of people give up on a training or fat loss program after
          a week or
          so because they did not see the results they were expecting.
          First of
          all, you have to remember that you didn't get fat overnight.
          So you
          should not expect a miracle weight loss to happen as well.
          Setting
          realistic and measurable goals will help keep you motivated
          and
          continue towards your ultimate weight loss goal. So what
          considered as
          a realistic goal? Losing 0.5-1kg (1-2 lbs) a week is a
          realistic.
          Losing half an inch on your waist after two weeks is
          realistic. Of
          course, you have to be completely honest with yourself when
          you are
          accessing these goals. Ask yourself if you are really
          following the
          exercise program religiously? How many times did you cheat on
          your diet?</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #7: Focus on building muscle</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Some
          people may disagree with me that exercising and
          muscle-building is
          important for fat loss. To me, fat loss is all about changing
          our body
          composition - reducing the fat mass and increasing fat-free
          mass
          (muscles). Increasing fat-free mass will invariably contribute
          to the
          lowering of fat mass. For each pound of muscle your body has,
          you burn
          an extra 35-50 calories a day. Fat on the other hand burns
          only 2
          calories per pound. So the more muscle you have, the higher
          your
          metabolic rate will be. And contrary to popular belief, having
          more
          muscles is what will give your body those sexy curves that the
          opposite
          sex desires.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #8: Invest in a whey protein or meal
          replacement supplement</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Having
          3 meals a day with 3 snacks times in between is not always
          easy to
          prepare. That's why for convenience purposes, it's recommended
          that you
          purchase a good whey protein or meal replacement supplement.
          Just add
          water or milk and you have one serving of quality protein.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #9: Make small changes and stick with
          them for 21 days</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Let's
          be honest with ourselves. Fat loss involves some behavioral
          and
          lifestyle change. Your current lifestyle got you to the state
          that you
          are now. Continuing down this path obviously is not the
          quickest way to
          lose weight. We all know behavioral change is the hardest
          thing. This
          is why we need to make little changes every day that is more
          acceptable
          to our bodies. For example, if you currently drink two cans of
          soda
          every day, cut down to one can a day. Then next week, cut down
          to one
          can every two days. You get the picture. And for any program
          that you
          decide to get started, stick with it for 21 days. Statistics
          have shown
          that any behavioral change takes 21 to accept and
          approximately 60 days
          to form into a habit. So no matter how much you hate a current
          diet or
          exercise program, persevere for 21 days. You will be glad you
          did.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #10: Surround yourself with like-minded
          people</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Some
          people are very dependent on social support, while others not
          so much.
          If you belong to the former group, it is important that you
          factor this
          aspect of motivation especially when you are starting out on a
          fat loss
          program. During the initial 21 days, it is important to stay
          motivated
          and focused on the goals you have set for yourself. You are
          bound to
          encounter challenges and struggles as you go through the
          program. Such
          as days when your thighs are so sore after doing full body
          squats or
          even good news like when you succeed in losing an inch off
          your waist.
          If you have friends who are doing the fat loss program with
          you, great!
          Share your results and how you feel about the program with
          them. Talk
          to fitness professionals; join online communities or Facebook
          groups to
          share experiences and gain knowledge. Also, don't just focus
          on the fat
          loss part. Get into the whole health and fitness experience.
          Buy
          fitness magazines, visit fitness websites. Look at physiques
          you desire
          to achieve and set them as your desktop wallpaper. Do whatever
          you need
          to stay motivated.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #11: Train your legs</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I'm
          not just talking about jogging here; I'm referring to doing
          heavy
          squats, lunges, deadlifts, etc. If you have ever done squats
          before,
          you will know that it is one of the most demanding exercises
          in the
          world. You pant and sweat like a dog as if you have sprinted a
          mile.
          But it is also one of the best exercises for building overall
          strength
          and of course burning calories. Leg exercises such as squats
          are
          usually compound exercises and as such burns more calories.
          Even if you
          are not doing weighted squats, just doing body weight squats
          alone can
          be just as challenging. To be honest, in my first 5 years of
          training,
          I never once trained my legs. I always thought the upper body
          is more
          important and doing squats could stunt your vertical growth.
          That is
          all a fallacy. Ever since I started doing squats, my strength
          went
          through the roof and my body fat levels have remained
          consistently low
          all year-round. Now I do squats at least once a week otherwise
          my
          workout is never complete. If you have never trained your legs
          before,
          trust me, start your workouts with squats and you will be
          amazed by the
          results you see. And yes, you can thank me later.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #12: Keep a meal diary</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Many
          people don't realize how many calories they consume every day.
          You
          think you are eating less by skipping a meal here and there.
          But you
          never consider those sodas, grande Frappuccinos or those
          cookies
          distributed by your colleagues that you so casually put in
          your mouth
          during the day. If you take down everything (and I mean every
          single
          thing including those mentos) that you eat into a meal diary,
          you will
          be surprised how many calories you are taking. Yes, I know
          it's quite a
          pain to record down everything. But do yourself a favor and
          just do it
          for one day. It will be an absolute eye opener.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>How To
          Lose Weight Fast Tip #13: Learn to love water</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Perhaps
the
          most overlooked causes of weight gain, the liquids you consume
          can
          deceptively pack on a ton of calories. Just a can of soda
          contains
          close to 150 calories. A grande mocha Frappuccino contains a
          whopping
          420 calories. Drink a soda and a Frappuccino every day and you
          will
          gain a pound a week.</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Because
we
          can so easily and carelessly gulp down beverages without a
          second
          thought, liquid calories are more harmful. Fruit juices are no
          better.
          They all contain naturally occurring fruit sugar, fructose,
          which like
          all other sugars if consumed in excess will result in weight
          gain. One
          of the quickest ways to lose weight is to always choose water
          over all
          other beverages. Water has zero calories and is a natural
          source of
          hydration for our bodies. By simply replacing all your other
          sugary
          laden beverages with water, you will quickly be able to see
          weight loss
          results.</big></big></p>

            href="http://www.corporatefatlossplan.com">How To Lose
            Weight Fast</a> Tip #14: Limit alcohol consumption</big></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I
          know it is almost impossible to completely abstain from
          alcohol. But if
          your goal is to find the fastest way to lose weight, then you
          have to
          cut down on your happy hours. Alcohol is a toxic substance
          with
          absolutely no nutritional benefit whatsoever. What's more,
          each gram of
          alcohol contains 7 calories. A few glasses of cocktails with
          its sugary
          mixers can easily pile on at least 1000 or more calories a
          night. You
          should also know that alcohol is an appetite stimulant. So
          don't be
          surprised if you feel hungry after a night of partying. Of
          course this
          leads to additional calories into your body that you don't
          need. If you
          are focusing on building muscle, excessive alcohol lowers your
          testosterone and increases cortisol levels (stress hormone)
          thereby
          reducing your body's ability to build muscle effectively.</big></big></p>
