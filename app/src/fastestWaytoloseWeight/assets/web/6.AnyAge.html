            style="font-weight: bold;">How to Lose Weight Fast at Any
            Age</span><br>
          <small>By Tracey
            J May</small></big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Now
          that I know how weight loss really works, I can lose it
          fairly quickly when I want to. However, it wasn't always that
          way.
          Sometimes it took me months to lose about one pound. That's
          because I
          had no idea how fast weight loss really worked. For example, I
          thought
          that if I just went hungry, that would cause quick fat loss.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>However,
I
          didn't know that caused my body to go into
          "survival mode" where it tried to hang on to as much body fat
          as
          possible. So yes, there are ways to lose weight quickly other
          than
          going hungry. However, many people go about them all wrong.
          First there
          is no such thing as a fast weight loss shortcut. You can try a
          bogus
          body wrap, sweat suit, etc, but with these all you loose is
          water
          weight.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>You
          can also try to use other useless fast weight loss
          shortcuts like diet pills, herbs, teas, patches, lotions
          muscle
          contractors, etc.- but again, all that's going to happen is
          you're
          going to waste money and time- time you could be spending
          losing weight
          quickly the way it works in reality.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If
          your skeptical about weight loss shortcuts not working
          because all the advertising says they do work, just remember
          this:
          Nearly two out of three Americans are overweight or obese,
          while
          spending over 50 billion dollars annually on weight loss
          products. So
          if anything you could buy really made you lose weight fast,
          would this
          many people still be overweight?</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So
          what are some fast way to lose weight?</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>You
          have to burn off that fat. Nothing else works. Meaning,
          you have to use more calories that you consume. The faster you
          burn
          them off, the faster you will lose weight. It really is that
          simple.
          Let me give you an example of super fast weight loss:</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Several
years
          ago there was a a cable documentary about a man
          that lost fourteen pounds in around twelve hours. How? He swam
          the
          English Channel. Since he didn't eat while swimming, his body
          had no
          choice but to use fat stores for energy. Calories consumed as
          energy
          depends on the person and the activity. In his case, around
          49,000
          calories of energy were consumed from fat in twelve hours.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Now
          note I'm not saying you should try this. This guy was is
          really good shape. As a matter of fact, he put those extra
          pounds on
          intentionally, because he knew fat was going to be needed for
          energy.
          I'm just providing an example of how fast weight loss can work
          in the
          "real" world.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If you
          want to lose weight quickly, you can do something
          similar, just not so extreme. The first thing you need to do
          is change
          as many weight gain habits as possible over to weight loss
          habits. The
          more habits you change, the faster the weight will be burned
          off. If
          you don't have any interest in giving up double cheese supreme
          pizzas
          or going running instead of sitting on the sofa- then you're
          wasting
          your time. You have to burn off as many calories as you can-
          while you
          reduce the calories that are coming in [without going
          overboard and
          throwing your body into survival mode].</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So
          don't try to starve yourself and don't go on a special
          diet. [Dieting is just another useless trap that has been
          PROVEN not to
          work. Just eat more foods that fill you up with far fewer
          calories,
          like fruits and veggies. To lose weight as fast, easily, and
          safely as
          possible- you need to keep an eye on calorie density. This
          just means
          instead of filling up on Big Macs, you fill up on healthy
          natural
          fibrous foods like fruits and veggies, along with other
          natural foods
          that are low in carbs and high in protein like cold water
          fish, lean
          meats, eggs, etc.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Don't
          go overboard and cut out carbs, your body needs carbs
          for energy. However, it does NOT need the man made carbs that
          come in
          cake, candy, donuts, chips, sodas, energy drinks, etc. You are
          trying
          to burn fat for fuel. If you fill up on junk food, your body
          will NEVER
          tap into your fat stores for fuel.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So eat
          natural carbs, just keep an eye on them while you are
          in fast weight loss mode. Here's my best how to lose weight
          fast
          [http://www.how-to-lose-weight-fast.org] tips:</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Do not
          drink colas [even diet] sport drinks, or energy drinks.
          These are filled with carbs that keep you from tapping into
          your fat
          stores. Milk is also loaded with carbs in the form of lactose-
          a sugar.
          If you want to drop weight as quickly as possible, stick to
          water or
          tea [no coffee].</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Eat
          your natural carbs early in the day. That way you have the
          entire day to burn them off.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Eat NO
          carbs after around 6 PM- especially the carbs in junk
          food- or bread and pasta.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Do
          some cardio before you go to bed, this way you burn off any
          left over carbs and don't store them as fat when your
          metabolism slows
          way down as you sleep.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Do at
          least a 20 minute cardio workout first thing in the
          morning on a empty stomach- or with a very small amount of
          protein, say
          25 grams max. Then wait about an hour before you eat. If you
          can, don't
          sit down for that hour. Then eat nothing but protein- like
          eggs or lean
          meat- for breakfast. Do you see why this fast fat loss tip
          works so
          well? You wake up with no fuel in your system, so when you get
          active,
          your body has no choice but to burn fat for fuel.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If you
          want to make weight loss as fast as possible, let food
          do the work for you. Eat unprocessed foods and three or four
          natural
          snacks a day. When you go to have your main meals, eat bulky
          and
          fibrous foods first- like fruits and veggies. This way you get
          full
          before you eat too many calories- and the more calories you
          eat, the
          more you have to burn off.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Be
          careful and use your common sense. In my humble opinion,
          talk to your doctor first. Tell him / her what you have in
          mind. Your
          doctor knows your health history better than me, and will able
          to give
          you specific advise on how many calories you can safely cut
          back on-
          and how much physical activity you can tolerate without
          hurting
          yourself.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So
          yes, there are fast ways to lose weight. However diet
          products sold by the giant weight loss industry are not one of
          them.
          You have to burn off more calories than you consume- nothing
          else works.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If you
          read this and just thought "whoa- this sounds like a
          lot of work. I don't know if I can do all this" all I can tell
          you is
          this:</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>It's
          all in the habits. The more weight gain habits you change
          over to weight loss habits, the faster you will lose weight.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Sure,
          I could tell you that I lost 30 pounds in thirty days by
          using Acai berry, hoodia, a patch, or a colon cleanse.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>But
          that would be a lie.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Gaining
control
          of your weight habits can change your entire
          life so much, that I'd rather die poor than to lie to you.
          Know why?
          Because I know that if you buy a fast weight loss shortcut, it
          won't
          work. Then you might give up on losing weight- permanently.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I
          don't want that to happen.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If you
          don't like what you just read, bookmark this page and
          come back when you're ready. I promise seeing your habits as
          they are
          and changing them can transform your life and future in ways
          you can't
          begin to imagine.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>There's
no
          secret lose weight really fast tips, it's all the
          common sense things that I just told you about- that work in
          the real
          world.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>It's
          nothing you won't be able to learn too. Fast weight loss
          is just like trying to learn any new skill, like swimming. The
          slowest
          and most frustrating part in the very beginning. After that,
          it's easy,
          and you have a skill that will serve you the rest of your
          life.</big></big></p>
