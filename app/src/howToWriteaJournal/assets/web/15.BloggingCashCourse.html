          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Many people wonder what exactly is a blog,
          and how can it help their business, if at all. This is a
          common question that people ask me as I make big money on the
          internet with blogs, but before you can make big money with
          blogs you must first understand what blogs are all about,
          because many people simply don’t know. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The blog has been around for years, however
          just came into major popularity in the last three years. The
          weblog, or blog is simply a application that allows users to
          post written text that gets immediately posted to the web,
          like an online journal of sorts. The blog is something that is
          meant to be as easy to use as the word processor application
          on your computer. While most websites take hours to update, a
          blog can be updated in real time, as quick as one would save a
          file to a computer. This is partly what makes blogs magical.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blogging is a great way to get information
          on the internet inexpensively with friendly results, such as
          high search engine ranking, and free advertising. The blog,
          with it’s variety of keyword heavy posts allows people to make
          money off of the high return result on a search engine like
          Google. What this means is that if you are selling home
          security systems, and you create a blog about good deals on
          such systems, chances are people looking for a security system
          will come across your blog in the search engine. This added
          exposure will surly help more people notice your business, and
          make purchases, thus creating greater business for you.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blogs are most commonly found on the
          internet via the World Wide Web, and can be published for free
          by some of the biggest names on the internet. The fact that
          the blog is free is the main reason why people can so easily
          profit from using them, because there is no real upfront
          investment with blogs, and thus there is only one way to go
          from zero dollars invested, and that’s to profit. <br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Name one person that doesn’t like to share
          his or her point of view, and you will have just named nobody
          at all. The point of the above exercise is to show the simple
          fact that everyone likes to talk about themselves, and what
          they are up to, even if they say that they do not like doing
          so. There is something about being human that makes us self
          involved to the point where we truly feel as if others want,
          or need to know what is going on with us. Blogs offer one a
          unique way to express his or her feelings on any number of
          issues, with a shield that only the internet can provide. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The most common use of a blog is that of a
          journal, or an opinionated piece of writing involving some
          aspect of the author’s day to day life. While some blogs are
          totally commercially driven, they are often masked as personal
          musing in order to entice visitors. This is something that
          just can’t be avoided, people love checking out other peoples
          blogs to see what’s going on.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The internet can be a cold and bare place
          for people to be at times, and the blog helps create a sense
          of community with its powerful reach, and ease of use. Many
          people want to share, or keep up with others, but simply don’t
          have time. Email has gotten to the point that people are
          overwhelmed just to deal with their regular inbox each day,
          nonetheless an email from an old friend, and thus checking
          someone’s blog is commonplace nowadays. In fact, there are
          millions of blogs out there, and most of them are intended to
          be read by family and friends.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blogging is popular because it relates to
          community, family, and friends, and therefore it is in direct
          relation with what matters most in life. Blogs can be a
          powerful tool to communicate to others, as well as to market
          with, as they are so friendly to search engines in terms of
          keywords, and ranking. Just making a few blog posts can
          literally get you noticed immediately, and is something that
          truly can help you become a big player in the internet
          business game.<br>

              Them</font></big></big></b><br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Having a niche blog is something that can
          be profitable and easy, or challenging and difficult depending
          on how you handle the day to day posting. Niche blogs are
          typically blogs related to one or more specific industries or
          fields, including hobbies, illnesses, and sports. The more
          niche, or in-depth a blog is, the harder it might be for
          people not involved in that niche to get into. It is for this
          reason that one must think about the best way to make the most
          out of niche blogs, and finding the right niche is a good
          start.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When searching for the right night for any
          blog, be sure to look at the prospective audience, and your
          abilities to keep the blog up to date within that niche. If
          you are thinking about doing a blog about horse racing, yet
          you have no time to watch horse races, it might not make sense
          to try to do a niche blog on the subject. Instead a good way
          of finding a niche is by looking at what it is that you do
          have time to do, and then creating a blog based on that
          instead. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After you have selected your niche blog
          topic, it’s time to become an expert. No matter how much you
          think you know about your niche blog theme, chances are you
          could use some brushing up on the topic. One can brush up on a
          topic by simply doing research on the niche blog theme, and
          spending a few hours reading within the blog subject territory
          each day. Feel free to check out rival blogs, as they will
          give you an idea of what is popular in this niche, and what is
          not.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The most important part of getting the most
          out of a niche blog is becoming the go to place for
          information in this niche. That means creating a blog that is
          constantly updated, and is accurate in the stories relating to
          the subject. If you do this with your niche blog, expect big
          time results.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Concentrating on the benefits of a
          Wordpress blog can provide you with some great optimism for
          the future. The reason Wordpress is such powerful software is
          the combination of value, quality, and ease of use that is
          unparallel in the blog software world. While some people
          prefer to use more basic blog software, they too can truly
          benefit from the power of Wordpress, and once they read about
          all the perks they too will be downloading the software for
          profit as well.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What might be the most notable benefit of
          Wordpress is the ability to work on a post offline, in a
          standalone interface. Most blog software applications require
          one to be logged onto the internet, and geared up ready to go
          to post to the blog, whereas Wordpress allows you to edit,
          build, and post a blog at anytime, without being connected to
          the internet. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Another benefit of Wordpress is the ease of
          use, and advanced functionality of the software compared to
          some blog software applications. Wordpress functions code free
          if one needs to post in such a fashion with easy to use icons
          similar to what one would see in a word processing program.
          Having the ability to utilize a program like this allows
          people to create blogs that are as high tech, and complete as
          full blown websites.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Yet another benefit of Wordpress is its
          remarkable plugin library that allows for users to instantly
          add features, and functions to Wordpresses already impressive
          abilities. The plugin library for Wordpress is robust because
          of the popularity of the software, many programmers and
          designers have created plugins based on their particular
          needs. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you add up all these elements you end
          up with a program that is fully capable of creating highly
          attractive blogs that encourage people to visit the sight and
          stay to read whatever is posted on it. If you ever wanted
          powerful blog software that was less template and more unique
          Wordpress is it.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blogging can greatly enhance any websites
          natural search results through regular posting, and natural
          keyword placement. There in fact is no stronger way to market
          ones website for free than by blogging with natural keywords.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Similar to article marketing, posting daily
          blogs with the keywords of your business included can have
          remarkable effects on the ranking of your site in any given
          search engine, and thus net you more traffic. The key to
          gaining more traffic from the keywords is what is called long
          tail keywords, and short tail keywords. The word tail refers
          to the length of the keyword term. A short tail keyword term
          would be “internet marketing” whereas a long tail keyword term
          would be “internet marketing for people that own mac
          computers” and so on. The short and long tailed keywords help
          your post get picked up in the search engine as highly
          applicable to the keyword that a person was searching in the
          first place.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Getting picked up in search engines can
          lead to huge masses of traffic heading to your site everyday.
          There are top keyword placers that use blogs to retain huge
          amounts of daily traffic to their sites just by implementing
          these long and short tail keywords into their posts. The
          amazing thing about blogs is they are picked up by the search
          engines almost as quickly as one posts to it, which makes it a
          wonderful tool for SEO purposes.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Another way blogging can help your sites
          search engine ranking is by the quality score. Most search
          engines, including Google rank sites with a quality score, the
          more unique, user provided content, the higher the quality
          score. If a website is just a sales page, and a few pictures,
          the quality score will most likely be low. But if a site has a
          blog on it, with fresh, daily posts, the quality score becomes
          much better, and thus the site gets ranked much higher when
          people are searching for your niche, or keyword terms.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people fail to realize that blogs
          started out as a subscription style online journal for people
          to receive via email, otherwise known as a RSS feed. Blogs are
          at their most fundamental state nothing more than a journal
          posting that can be delivered to subscribers via email. The
          RSS feed is an easy way to land your blog post in millions of
          people’s inboxes, and on the net under bookmarks as well. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With the advancement in technology the RSS
          feeds will now auto update themselves to provide people with a
          wonderful array of blog posts daily without ever having to
          actually visit the blog itself. This means that one can grow a
          virtual subscriber base with one simple niche blog, and profit
          from the experience every time they make a post. Utilizing the
          power of blogging and RSS one can make some serious money by
          keeping people up to date with affiliate products, and
          services. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Since the RSS feed will deliver the blog to
          subscriber’s mailboxes, and let millions of people on the net
          know what your blog is about through a RSS feed description,
          it makes sense to attempt to profit from such an advantageous
          situation. By offering affiliate products, one can provide
          their own affiliate link embedded into the blog for readers to
          click. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One example of setting up a blog for
          maximum RSS exposure is to write a blog with hyperlinked
          keywords that are directly linked to your products. The more
          links the better, as the more chances you will have to sell
          the affiliate items to your subscriber base. Make sure that
          the links are either live, or given actual URL’s in the actual
          post so that the user can stay within their own e-mail
          application while reading, and visiting the recommend site
          that you provide them with.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;RSS feeds are hugely popular today, and
          known to help search engine optimization as well, and thus are
          a must do for anyone serious about profiting off of blogs.
          Setting up the RSS feed is as easy as filling out a short
          questionnaire in the blog appliaciton of your choice, which
          means it takes little time to do something that can help you
          profit big.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the easiest, if not the easiest way
          to make money with AdSense is by posting to blogs. AdSense and
          blogs go together like peas and carrots, or peanut butter and
          jelly, and the results tend to show this fact. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The key with any AdSense optimized website
          is traffic, the more traffic that comes to the website, the
          more clicks the ads will get. While traffic is the key, there
          is one other important aspect of AdSense money making schemes,
          and that is keyword placement. AdSense advertisements must be
          triggered by a keyword, or set of keywords, and can often be
          cumbersome if the website the AdSense is hosted on doesn’t
          offer the exact keywords the ads need to be triggered. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With blogs one can rest assured that if
          they are making daily posts, most every AdSense ad possible
          for their niche will run at some point during the blogs life.
          This means that the variety of AdSense ads on blogs is second
          to none, and the traffic is also very good. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The majority of web traffic comes from
          search engine listings, and blogs help even the most novice
          marketer place high in the search engine rankings. By having a
          high place in the search engine rankings one can receive
          copious amounts of traffic to their site on a daily basis for
          free.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AdSense is a marketing business that needs
          to be tested constantly to ensure effectiveness. The sad fact
          is that many websites need to have certain keywords on them to
          attract big dollars, and the typical AdSense client might not
          get the traffic to trigger those ads for years, if ever. With
          blogs one can constantly test the keywords on the site to help
          prompt better advertisements on his or her website.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Using AdSense as a way to make money with
          blogs simply makes sense, a lot of sense, as it is the
          easiest, most effective way to make money on the internet
          without doing a single thing different with your blog besides
          placing the code in at the top to allow the ads to be shown.<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In making money with blogs there is one
          element that trumps all the rest in importance, advertisement
          placement. The actual spot where you put your ad is as
          important to your profits as any other thing you do with your
          blog, ever. The most successful people that blog for profit
          utilize special placement for their advertisements so to best
          get results from the site visitor, and from experience I can
          tell you this works like a charm. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Putting your advertisements at the top of
          the blog isn’t good enough anymore. Many people have been
          using computers long enough to train themselves to ignore the
          advertisement banners at the top of a website, or blog, and
          thus you the publisher must find new, and unique ways to get
          the advertisements read, and clicked by your visitors. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One place to put the advertisements for
          your blog is directly to the right hand side of the daily blog
          post. Research shows that the human eyes tend to gravitate to
          the upper right hand side of any page, which is where your
          advertisement should be in order to obtain maximum exposure.
          The more the ad is put in this spot, the better rate of clicks
          that you will get on the ad.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Another great place to put the
          advertisement is in the body of the text. This is commonly
          done by highlighting, and adding hyperlinks to some of the
          more popular keywords. By adding such keywords one can simply
          click on the highlighted word to learn more about a product,
          or service you might be promoting. In text ads aren’t ever
          very big as not to disrupt the text, but can pack a serious
          punch in terms of sales because of the natural curiosity of
          the reader to check out whatever it is you are promoting.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally one can place advertisements at the
          bottom of the blog, with more information about you, the
          author of the blog. Since blogs are typically personal, people
          enjoy reading about the author, and thus it makes sense to
          include a few ads near your profile, to capitalize on the
          profile checking nature of your visitors.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No matter what the website, in order for it
          to be a success one needs to have a constant and steady stream
          of traffic to profit, and this is certainly the case for those
          creating blogs. There are simply too many factors to ignore
          when it comes to getting traffic, and thus people that are
          able to harness traffic to their blog are known as masters of
          the internet. The interesting fact is that getting traffic to
          your blog is easier than you might think, and just takes some
          creative thinking, and a few hours a day of shameless
          promotion.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So after you hit up your family and
          friends, who else is going to read your blog? The answer is
          likely nobody unless you give them a reason to read it. This
          is where the traffic driving secrets come into play when
          dealing with a blog. The best way to get traffic to your blog
          is by using free promotional methods. The key is to have
          something on your blog worth checking out once they get there,
          but for this part we’ll simply focus on getting traffic.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start out by joining all the forums, and
          social networks in your niche. If you have a blog that is
          aimed at giving dating advice, make sure to join all the
          dating forums you can, and any free dating sites possible. The
          first thing to do is find out where your link is allowed, and
          post your blog link in your signature. Once this is done take
          a few hours each day to make posts, eventually people will
          start considering you an expert, and gladly check out your
          site.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next it is important to start submitting
          your blog posts as articles to free article directories. The
          free article directories will help promote your blog by
          distributing the articles to thousands of resources, which
          will also get your blog, and your article higher search engine
          ranking at the same time.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally start to collect email addresses
          and setup your blog for RSS feeds. Allow the membership to
          enjoy your blog in the comfort of their inbox by choosing the
          option on your blog software to email the blog post every time
          a new one goes up. This will be a way to attract daily traffic
          to your blog for free, and keep the traffic you receive from
          your expert forum posting coming back.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The amount of awesome blogging resources on
          the net today is outstanding, and can truly make any average
          blog a special one in no time. There are millions of resources
          for you to tap into when it comes to blogs, a few of the best
          ones are highlighted here for your consideration.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blogger.com is a website owned, and
          operated by Google that allows users to post blogs for free,
          and make money with AdSense. While blogger.com lacks the power
          of a Wordpress, it is easy for those that are interested in
          implementing their AdSense ads in a simple, little code,
          manner. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wordpress.com is another blog publishing
          software that is known on the net as the most powerful, and
          sophisticated blog publishers out there. Wordpress is also
          free, and allows users to build blogs that are much more
          advanced than a blogger.com site would be. Wordpress.com also
          allows users to customize their blog more than most, and even
          implements free plug-ins that are also worthwhile.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blogrankings.com is another great site that
          ranks all the latest and greatest blogs. The value of this
          site is to look at what other top bloggers are doing, and
          attempt to emulate it with your own blog. Understanding what
          makes a certain blog in your niche so popular can
          revolutionize the way you think about and post to your own
          blog, which could have long lasting positive effects.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TheFreeSite.com offers free blog resources
          that are as much fun, as they are useful. The site offers
          users free software, and plugins to enhance any blog, or even
          create one from scratch. Since so many blog updates are costly
          these days, TheFreeSite gives users a nice alternative with
          their free downloads of blog software. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Blogarama.com offers users a virtual
          telephone book of blogs from all areas of subject matter. No
          matter what your interest, or niche, this website can bring
          out the best and most popular blogs. This site is full of
          directory style listings, and even user ratings to help you
          search the net.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately the best blog resource is the
          one that caters to your needs, and thus must be sought out by
          you according to what you are trying to achieve. Seeking out
          your own best blog resources will certainly help you profit
          from blogs in the near future. <br>
