          Do you find it intimidating when you come to journal your
          scrapbook pages?<br>
          <br>
          You are not alone! Many scrapbookers find it hard to get
          started when it comes to adding journaling to their
          scrapbooking layouts.<br>
          <br>
          If you are one of those people who go blank at the thought of
          having to journal, don’t worry. Here are some stress-free
          scrapbooking journaling ideas to help you write the right
          words whatever your page theme.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b></font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Make a List</b></font></big></big></div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          This is a fairly simple journaling technique that is suitable
          for use with any type of page theme, for example:<br>
          Doing a friendship page - list how you met, where you met, how
          long you have known each other, include what you like about
          your friend and why you are both pals.<br>
          <br>
          Doing a recipe scrapbook page - then make a personal top 10
          list of reasons why you like Grandma’s chocolate cake so much.<br>
          <br>
          Doing a baby layout - do a list of baby’s favorite foods, you
          can even do one for the foods they don’t like!<br>
          <br>
          A variation of this technique is to use bullet points to mark
          each line on your list, giving you an opportunity to empathise
          each item of your journaling:<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <ul>
      <li><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Anguilla</font></big></big></li>
      <li><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">April 2004</font></big></big></li>
      <li><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">My first
              trip to the Caribbean</font></big></big></li>
    </ul>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          This is the view from my hotel balcony overlooking the cove –
          I can’t wait to go swimming the sea looks so nice!<br>
          <br>
          Make sure you have fun experimenting with all the different
          kinds of embellishments that you can use as your bullet
          points! Another bonus with using the list technique is that
          you do not need to worry about the structure of your sentences
          or that your journaling makes sense because the list breaks
          down what you want to say into it’s basic readable form.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b></font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Write a Letter</b></font></big></big></div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          This is one of those great scrapbook journaling ideas that’s
          fairly simple to do and it’s also a lovely, personal way to
          journal your layouts too.<br>
          <br>
          All you have to do is pretend you’re writing to a friend
          telling them what is happening in your photographs and
          including the “Dear ….” at the beginning of your writing will
          give your journaling an intimate feel.<br>
          <br>
          Sent any emails lately? Like letters, emails are also a good
          source of journaling material that you can use for your
          layouts.<br>
          <br>
          If you are unsure of your own journaling then doing it in a
          letter format could help your writing flow more easily, as you
          describe the people and the events taking place, letting you
          tell the story naturally and in your own words.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b></font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Ask a </b><b>Q</b><b>uestion</b></font></big></big></div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          If you are completely stuck and cannot think of anything to
          write this can be a good quick fix technique to use. Just ask
          some simple questions like, “What was your favorite part
          of..?” or “Did anything funny or embarrassing happen?”.<br>
          This technique can be very effective when used for a special
          occasion layout, like a bridal shower, where you can ask each
          of the guests to tell you about their favorite memory of the
          bride-to-be.<br>
          <br>
          Why not take it a stage further? Give each shower guest some
          suitable decorative paper and let them write down their own
          memories rather than journal all of them yourself.<br>
          <br>
          For an extra special touch, you could get the guests to bring
          with them their favorite photo of the bride-to-be. Ask them to
          journal why they picked that particular picture and then do a
          separate layout for each individual photo. <br>
          This is an effective way to make a wonderful and unique
          scrapbook that is quick, simple and full of memorable pieces
          of journaling that add a very personal feel to the album.<br>
          <br>
