          Creative writing is considered to be one of the most
          perplexing forms of articulating thoughts and ideas on paper.
          It turns out to be a hard nut to crack because it requires the
          ability to think freely, giving thoughts a modicum of leeway,
          and express ideas and experienced feelings sincerely and
          openly.<br>
          <br>
          That’s why putting wind in the sails with creative writing is
          not within every writer’s grasp. It means that a person, who
          succeeded in process writing approach that is all about
          planning, revising, re-arranging, and deleting text,
          re-reading, and producing multiple drafts before producing
          finished documents, will have the same good results in
          creative writing.<br>
          <br>
          Surely, it doesn’t imply that creative writing process doesn’t
          need proper planning and preparation, it means that creative
          writing permits the author to deviate from the specific
          writing styles and not to be consistent with all the standards
          of this style. In a word, creative writing gives the author
          leeway in terms of presentation and development of a piece of
          writing.<br>
          <br>
          Since creative writing is not simply a matter of sitting down,
          putting pen to paper, following smart instructions of emeritus
          pundits, commence at the beginning and write through to the
          end. Creative approach treats all writing as a creative act
          that requires time, positive feedback, and inspiration to be
          done well. People who engage in creative writing do not merely
          think freely; they view the world from free-thinking
          perspective.<br>
          <br>
          Without a doubt, creative writing is not only about
          inspiration and gift of the writer, and it is far from coming
          easy to the writer, it also needs a lot of elbow grease in
          order to produce a piece of writing worth the attention of the
          readers.<br>
          <br>
          The key to success in creative writing lies in the author’s
          ability to be frank with his readers and honest with himself.
          Don’t be afraid to step aside from the established standards
          of the particular writing style, and open the door of your
          brain to the new ideas that cross the threshold of your
          imagination and knock around your mind.<br>
          <br>
          Remember that process and explorations are the keystones in
          creative writing, rather than the finished product. Let
          yourself release your inner genius and vent on paper the most
          bizarre ideas that amassed in your mind. The source of ideas
          for your creative writing can be various kinds of resources of
          creativity such as oral tradition, dreams, childhood memories,
          sense perceptions and intuition.<br>
          <br>
          Katrina Crosbie, a tutor of creative writing in Edinburgh
          University's Open Studies programme, asserts that getting in
          touch with subconscious mind is the key to original and
          creative writing. She also claims that every writer can
          harness three simple techniques to enhance his creative
          writing abilities, they are mental focusing techniques,
          harnessing the power of your dreams and journal writing.
          Harnessing these techniques takes hard work; so, if you are
          ready, roll up your sleeves and follow these simple
          strategies.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>I. Mental focusing techniques</b><br>
          <br>
          Mental focusing techniques involve focusing on the positive
          outcome. It implies that you should concentrate and regulate
          your mental activity in order to enter a quiet state of your
          mind. The key point in mental focusing is to get rid of all
          the stray thoughts and replace it with one thought; this
          process should gradually induce a calm sensation. The
          procedure is very simple, you make yourself comfortable in a
          cozy armchair, and in all possible ways try to awake
          creativity inside of you.<br>
          <br>
          You should say something like “I’m getting in touch with my
          creativity source”, and imagine physically how the stream of
          creativity comes into your mind. Remember the sensation of
          clear, cool water on your face, or a stream of fresh breeze,
          which is blowing in your face. Then imagine yourself sitting
          at your word processor, typing fluently, and writing avidly.
          After several minutes open your eyes and commence writing.<br>
          <br>
          <b>II. Harness the power of your dreams</b><br>
          <br>
          Dreams have tremendous power. The subconscious memory can be
          the direct cause of the certain dreams. “When the mind is
          centered on certain things, the sleeper goes over his life
          again and again in phantom fashion. He lives over the
          experiences of his daily life.”<br>
          <br>
          Overall, your daydreams can be important, just write them down
          after waking up in the morning. Perhaps, later on, re-reading
          the notes of your dreams will prompt you some interesting
          ideas for your creative works.”These can be triggers for an
          especially imaginative piece of work. American writer Joyce
          Carol Oates has said that her novel Bellefleur was inspired by
          a dream of a walled garden which haunted her for years 'till
          she felt she had to write about it.”<br>
          <br>
          <b>III. Keep the writing journal</b><br>
          <br>
          This technique of enhancing your creativity is very simple and
          at the same time highly productive. Buy yourself a notebook,
          so that you can always have it at hand and write some brief
          narratives in it on a daily basis.<br>
          <br>
          Don’t focus on the style, mistakes, and, in general, in the
          way you write. Just write down the first things that occur in
          your mind, even if you think that this is junk. The main idea
          is to keep your hand moving and to feel a growing sense of
          inspiration and confidence. In the course of time, you will
          become a practiced hand in writing. Surely, you’ll find your
          journal notes a rich source of inspiration and ideas.<br>
          <br>
          If you really want to enhance you creative writing abilities,
          give a try to these simple techniques, and bring your craft as
          a writer into play!<br>
