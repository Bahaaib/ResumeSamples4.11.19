          <br>
          Keeping a journal is a most rewarding experience. I have had
          several kinds of journals; one was a book where I wrote in it
          and another was a binder where I wrote the events of the day
          and also added everything from a chicken feather to cards,
          thank you notes and pictures. That was really a fun book. It's
          amazing the things you forget until you open your journal or
          look at a picture and all of the related memories instantly
          come to mind and you can talk about it as if it happened
          today. That is surely amazing!<br>
          <br>
          This amazing book can also tell you details of a special
          vacation, or your parents 50 year anniversary, or that special
          day when you turned 21; what about graduation and all of those
          feelings you felt.? Wouldn't it be neat to read those fond
          memories? Those words will take you right back to that moment,
          feelings and all. What about special times with family and
          friends? I can remember what an eventful day it was when I
          climbed a mountain. I was awestruck as I watched others climb
          straight up. <br>
          <br>
          To my amazement, my feet just kept moving and I did it too.
          What an experience to practically do the splits in trying to
          climb the huge rocks. When I got to the top of the mountain, I
          stood on a ledge with the very top at chest height and
          declared that I made it. This fellow told me I hadn't made it
          as I wasn't on the top. I said I was good where I was. He said
          I would really regret not getting to the top if I didn't get
          up there, so, "Get up here!" he said, as he gave me his hand.
          I was petrified. <br>
          <br>
          Though my body was rigid in fear, I crawled to the very top of
          the mountain that day. I even laid down over a rock straight
          out from the mountain top and looked down 3000 feet to the
          ground. I couldn't believe I did that. I am forever grateful
          to that fellow for talking me into going to the top of the
          mountain because today, I am unstoppable. I can do whatever I
          want to do. Success in it's finest is my intention and if I
          can take others with me, I help them on their way to success
          as well.<br>
          <br>
          There are also family journals where everyone writes about
          family events from their perspective. There could be one
          person who summarizes family events from year to year such as
          family re-unions. All of those moments and memories come and
          go and it just takes a wonderful journal to flash them back
          right before your eyes again.<br>
          <br>
          Parents can keep their favorite drawings and pictures of their
          children. I have a picture my son drew of me when he was very
          young and I still feel warm when I look at it. Grandparents
          can write about their fun times with their grandchildren.
          Children can start writing journals at quite a young age. My
          grandson is eight years old and he writes a lot. He writes
          about sports, school, his friends and other activities. <br>
          <br>
          We can write about our pets as we love them so much. I have
          had numereous pets and loved them all intensely; each one with
          their own special personality and they were all considered
          family. Vacations are a great time to keep a family journal.
          What fond memories and fun when you read and remember the
          places you visited, restaurants, perhaps new foods you tried,
          the new people you met and what you did or the hikes you went
          on. Let's not forget all the souvineres we might have taken
          home. The pictures that were taken that we can ooo and aaaah
          over are awesome memories. It is truly endless what you can
          write about.<br>
          <br>
          Special occasion memories are most important and are another
          area for journal keeping. Did you have a special birthday,
          special time or special event that you would like to remember?
          Start writing now before its gone. Something that comes to
          mind for me is during the dark winter days when my husband is
          driving home from work, I turn on all the front lights of the
          house which he can see a block away. It's a blaze of glory for
          him to come home to and he loves it when I do that. I always
          tell him, "Hurry home to me!" Truly he has the same smile when
          he comes home as he did years ago when we were first married.
          It's marvellous!<br>
          <br>
          Your journal can have pictures of you taken each year and you
          can have fun how you change over the years. It can have
          pictures of your home or homes as you move about.<br>
          <br>
          Your journal should be a place of inspiration for others who
          read it. It can be a source of comfort in solving a huge
          problem that you faced and conquered. I remember a day when I
          sat in my office all alone where the atomosphere was
          absolutely still, quiet and tense. I felt that the whole world
          stood still. I was facing a huge problem and only I alone
          could come up with the solution and I knew it. <br>
          <br>
          How could I save my business? And there I sat deep in thought
          and unmoving for some considerable time. I just sat and
          stared, it seemed forever. And then it came to me. I picked up
          the phone and made a call to someone with whom I treasured as
          my very special friend. There was no one else. He was the only
          one; there was no one else on this entire planet who could
          help me and even though I didn't know really what to say, I
          knew it would take care of itself. I didn't know how, but I
          knew my special friend, this great man I admired so much,
          would make it right. And indeed, he saved my business and he
          gave me a new beginning. He gave me that opportunity to live
          and fulfill my dream and intention of having a massive,
          passive income by asking me to be his partner. It has proven
          to be the best and finest business decision I have ever made.<br>
          <br>
          Don't forget to record medical histories where necessary.
          Keeping a journal here would be critical. I have a friend who
          suffers from depression. I so admire her; she went off of all
          those pills and went a natural route to health. It was a tough
          go. Her wonderful husband kept a journal of her medications,
          the changes, her reactions and any other pertinent
          information. Guess what happened? Everytime a question arose
          about what order of pills or reactions to medications, what,
          where and when, he had the answers. <br>
          <br>
          Truly amazing! <br>
          <br>
          Can you see the importance of a journal? I hope in some way
          that I have inspired you to start a journal. I hope some of my
          stories helped you to have some of your stories come to life
          again. Write your family history. You are so very special; no
          one can ever replace you and each and every one of us has a
          one-of-a-kind story to tell; if it isn't written, it will be
          lost. <br>
          <br>
          Start today and as by-gone memories come to mind, write them
          down as well. Write a minimum of three successes each and
          every day and you will immediately find that keeping a journal
          will literally change your life. A journal is a number one
          best seller because everyone will enjoy reading it for decades
          to come! May I suggest you start one today.<br>
