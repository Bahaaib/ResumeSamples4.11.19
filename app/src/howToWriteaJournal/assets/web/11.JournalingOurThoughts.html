          Contemplate for a moment how you felt the instant you laid
          eyes on your very first love. Is that how you feel about this
          person today? What do you think about this person, if you even
          think about them at all anymore? Remembering back to that
          moment, are you able to articulate your faith experience from
          that time? How would you describe your faith now? <br>
          <br>
          Where our thoughts, feelings and faith fit into our journaling
          process are as crucial as every other element, if not more so.
          Recognizing them as the main ingredients of the whole of life
          is about as simple, and as complicated, as as it gets. If you
          are able to clarify your thoughts, feelings and faith around
          an earlier or present experience through journaling them, you
          have the capacity to transform your life.<br>
          <br>
          Undisturbed and unexamined, old thoughts can continue to
          direct us down unusable, personally destructive paths, leaving
          us wondering why our lives are miserable and frustrating.
          Perhaps your organizational skills are a challenge for you,
          and each time you are in a position to plan an event, personal
          or professional, you become frustrated and are not sure where
          to begin. Your mind goes in three different directions at
          once, you are unable to focus on a set of steps to put
          together the theme, the activities, the refreshments and the
          guest list. Journaling this process in the present can help
          you focus your energy, understand where your thoughts are
          taking you, and, over time, help you redirect your thoughts
          down more productive avenues.<br>
          <br>
          Negative feelings, set in emotional concrete and stroked
          fervently over the years, scrape away at our souls until,
          turning to hardened calluses, we no longer remember to feel
          anything other than bitterness and resentment. Left
          unexamined, unchallenged, life passes us by. All the positive
          energy in the world bounces off the solid boundaries of
          someone determined to remain mired in disillusionment and
          denial. Writing down how we feel about whatever is happening
          in our lives mainly gives us perspective. From heart, to pen,
          to paper, we are creating a channel for our feelings, and a
          little bit of space that gives us breathing room, and an
          opportunity to make different feeling choices for ourselves. <br>
          <br>
          When we have become so intimate with a pattern of feelings
          that we can only sense the trench deepening beneath us, we
          need to create a new pattern. Journaling can help us create
          that new, potentially life-altering pattern by first giving us
          the opportunity to recognize the old one we are in without
          judgment or fear.<br>
          <br>
          By the same token, faith left unexamined is usually a faith
          not lived, and becomes a faith that succumbs to stagnation or
          death. Prayer is clearly a key component to infusing energy,
          strength and purpose into our faith, but journaling can again
          give us the opportunity and the framework to recharge
          ourselves by releasing old patterns to make room for the new.
          Have you ever consciously asked yourself how your faith spoke
          to you in any given situation? How about when you were faced
          with a tough disciplinary situation with your child? Or when
          you were trying to decide on how to balance your work with
          your personal life? How did your faith speak to you as you
          woke up this morning?<br>
          <br>
          All of these are situations in which our faith is present,
          whether we use its strength and wisdom purposefully in our
          lives, or not. Journaling how we understand our faith has, or
          has not, addressed our lives recently or in the past, can help
          us begin to use our faith consciously and regularly.<br>
          <br>
          Considering how our thoughts, feelings and faith speak to us
          in the journaling process invites God to the dialogue, a
          God-centered conversation in which we can observe how and when
          our beliefs were engaged, or not engaged, in the process of
          living. An examined life transforms to an informed life, and
          an informed life transcends to a consciously-lived life. When
          we are conscious on our journey, it's a whole lot easier to
          recognize God and follow our purpose in life.<br>
