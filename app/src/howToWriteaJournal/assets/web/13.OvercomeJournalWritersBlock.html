          Writers block! Many famous columnists have it. One admits that
          at least 30 times a day when writing his humor column, he gets
          up from his computer to sip his Pepsi and to divert his
          attention when he can't think of what to write. <br>
          <br>
          As a writer you may think you are blocked because you think
          your journal or book may not be significant enough, you don't
          know how to format it, or since you aren't famous, your book
          won't sell. Or, like many journalists, you can't think of
          something great to say.<br>
          <br>
          Be encouraged beyond your doubts. Know that your journal or
          book is unique and offers useful solutions to help your
          audience solve their challenge or problem. You don't have to
          write like others.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">What is Writer's Block?</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          To me it's just that I'm distracted and don't seem organized
          enough with what's important to write for my particular
          audience. It's a signal that my brain won't focus temporarily.
          Like many writers, I need a break.<br>
          To some of you, it's like stepping off a cliff and plunging
          into the abyss. You don't have all the answers to start, so it
          becomes overwhelming to even put words to paper.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Why do we have Writer's Block?</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <b>1. We have too many ideas/ choices.</b> We need to focus on
          one thing at a time. Write down 3-4 topics you are passionate
          about. Take some deep breaths, and let the #1 come forth.
          Write on one book primarily, and just put new ideas into the
          others' folder. Stay with your #1 book until you finish it.
          When we don't finish a project, we feel guilty--and hence more
          stuck!<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Fear.</b> Really, "False Evidence Appearing Real." Our
          performance anxiety keeps us from taking that next
          step.However, we can get direction and skills from a how-to
          book on writing or a qualified book coach if we are willing.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. We don't have enough information</b> to move forward to
          write a clear, compelling book. Perhaps we aren't sure of how
          to publish our book. Or, we don't know how to put a chapter
          together. Book writing information is easily available from
          the Internet. Do a search on "book coaching" and find helpful
          resources.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. It seems an enormous task in time and money.</b> What
          most emerging authors don't realize is that they don't have to
          write the "end all, be all" book. Just choose one focus such
          as solving one problem or writing for only one preferred
          audience per book. Targeted audiences are much easier to sell
          to.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>How to Get Unstuck</b></font></big></big></div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <b>1. Warm up!</b> Writers need to relax, get into alpha state
          each time before they write. So take deep belly breaths for
          1-2 minutes first. Another way to set up your book writing
          success is to listen to relaxing music before you set out to
          write. You may even warm up by handwriting something before
          you commit it to your computer.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>2. Got the blank page blues?</b> Write a little the day
          beforeâ€”then you have a partial page to hook new related,
          information onto. I wrote this article in two sittings because
          I didn't like my old introduction.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>3. Switch tasks, but honor a time set aside for writing
            each day.</b> If you are stuck in #1 book, add research
          stories, or how to's to the #2 book. If stuck on one chapter,
          start or work on another one.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>4. Organize your book, both on your computer and in
            paper files.</b> For your book, name it and save as the main
          folder. Add new files to this folder such as - the
          introduction - Chapter One and the rest - Table of Contents
          with Chapter Titles - The back cover, sales letter, or 30-60
          Second Tell and Sell (sales message).<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>5. Start a promotion folder, too.</b> Name one folder
          "traditional" and another one "online." Start adding files of
          promotion information as it comes to you.<br>
          <br>
          Then, when your book is almost finished, you'll have your
          promotion foundation ready to hit the ground running for fast,
          continuous sales that keep your cash flow going.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>6. Love your topic.</b> When you have passion for your
          book, you won't have many blocks. You'll be excited to sit
          down and spend special time each week on it. You may want to
          work daily like I do. When you do one "high level" activity a
          day on your book, you will finish before you know it and you
          will feel exhilarated and satisfied at your results.<br>
          <br>
          Remember a page a day yields 365 pages a year. Think about a
          shorter journal or book of only 25-50 pages you can deliver as
          an eBook or print book. You can finish one in less than a
          month!<br>
