          <br>
          It’s nearing the end of summer, and I have no credentials to
          my benefit these holidays. As the end of the holidays
          approach, I keep wondering what I have to show for the summer
          other than the noticeable tan, and the load of incomplete
          articles adorning my computer.<br>
          <br>
          Having nothing to write about can be exasperating. But having
          plentiful to do, and not doing it out of sheer laziness or
          lack of interest is a whole other story. I have articles
          months old that haven’t seen the light of day. Ah, if only I
          could complete them. But procrastination and laziness stand in
          the way. I’ve been telling myself that it’s the heat, but with
          the temperatures going down again, I'm not even left with that
          excuse.<br>
          <br>
          I have seemingly divorced myself from the half-written
          articles that sit there waiting on some remote folder in my
          computer. Somehow, I never get to completing something if I
          leave it midway. And this time is no different. I ended up
          opening the files, reading their contents, closing them with a
          mental note that they needed to be finished and went back to
          my Need for Speed racing adventure.<br>
          <br>
          After an endless round of mindless car racing, I decided it
          was time to get back to work. Having nothing to write about, I
          thought I’d try my hand at a journal. Writers are always
          saying that keeping journals spark up your creativity, but
          somehow I never thought I’d be writing in one. I’d always
          wondered why a writer would waste her precious time writing in
          a journal, when she could be earning money, writing those
          words in an article or story.<br>
          <br>
          So, I began Mission Journal by simply opening up my word
          processor and writing the first thing that came into my mind.
          Incidentally, I started rambling about how much I had wanted
          to achieve but with a drastic case of writer’s block having
          swept over me the last few days, my ambitions had been reduced
          to dust. Before I knew it, I had written two thousand words,
          simply on why I couldn’t write and how it was playing havoc
          with my spirit.<br>
          <br>
          I hate to admit it, but the truth is – I was wrong. A journal
          is not a waste of a writer’s time. It’s a learning process.
          When a computer professional sits down to learn a new
          programming language, he’s not wasting his time. He’s
          preparing himself for situations in which his programming
          skills could come in handy. Similarly, a journal can be the
          resource a writer digs into when she’s at a loss of ideas and
          can’t find anything to write about. It gives the writer
          practice she needs every single day, and enables her to create
          a much desired momentum in her writing.<br>
          <br>
          The day I started writing in my journal, was the day my
          month-long block finally came to an end. And as I wrote, I
          found my mind racing faster than my fingers could type. Soon,
          I was writing not only about my day, but also my holidays, my
          last semester and the last time the family went on a holiday
          together. Incidents kept springing to my mind and I was caught
          in the adrenalin rush. I was writing!<br>
          <br>
          I had needed a spark for my creativity, and the journal had
          done just that. It had made given me the push that I needed to
          start, and once I was writing, the ideas and the words came to
          me like they had never left my side.<br>
          Journals give the writer the three things she needs most:
          Practice, Motivation and Ideas.<br>
          <br>
          Now, everyday before I begin writing my articles or stories, I
          simply pen down a page in my journal. If I don’t feel like
          writing on paper, I’ve maintained a journal on my computer
          too. Not only do I get a jumpstart on my day, I also feel more
          energized and ready to write pages and pages of prose.<br>
          <br>
          Journals can also be a great storehouse of ideas. When you
          think that you’ve suddenly become unresponsive to the ideas
          around you or can’t find a character to fit into your stories,
          peek into your journal, and you’ll find something priceless
          there. The trip to the lake last summer or the fight with your
          neighbor might just become incidents in your next best seller.<br>
          <br>
          Journals are not necessarily diaries in which you record your
          personal thoughts and feelings. They can be lists of goals,
          pet care tips, or simply freewriting that you do everyday
          before you get to work. They needn’t even be focused on one
          topic – you can introduce random thoughts whenever and
          wherever you like. In writing a journal, there are no rules;
          you simply write what you want.<br>
          <br>
          As of writing this, I maintain four journals to suit my
          different moods. I don’t write in all of them everyday, but do
          try to write in at least one each day. On days that I don’t
          have too much work to do, I spark my creativity by writing in
          all four. Who knew, that a journal would become my best
          friend?<br>
