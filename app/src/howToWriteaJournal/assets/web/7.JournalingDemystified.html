          Journaling is a simple process of putting writing instrument
          to paper to express a thought, an idea, a belief, as it
          relates to your own life. Journaling can also be about
          creating order in one's mind, clearing out the cobwebs of a
          stressful time, assigning categories for life experiences
          worked through and shelved away from a time long past.
          Journaling creates a process by which we can integrate our
          faith with our life process, and include God in the dialogue.

          People journal for all kinds of reasons, including all of the
          above, as well as to mark an occasion they hope never to
          forget, a vacation of a lifetime and a lifetime well-lived.
          Individuals journal to connect with their souls, to enrich
          their conscious experience and to document the details which
          can slip away so easily. Mostly, people journal because they
          want to, and they love to.<br>

          Anybody who wants to journal and makes the time to do so can.
          Author Virginia Woolf, women journeying to settle the West in
          the nineteenth century, Mary Chestnut, Civil War-era Southern
          woman, war veterans from Revolutionary times to the present,
          and Anne frank, teenager killed in a World War II German
          concentration camp, all wrote journals which survived their
          writers to tell of their lives. Most of us have no intention
          of publishing what we write, in this lifetime or the next, so
          this is not a point of perfectionism or a belief that
          journaling is only for those who consider themselves good
          writers. Journaling is for anybody who wants to write, feels
          compelled to write, especially if only for themselves. <br>
          <br>
          As people in our culture become more comfortable with
          expressing their feelings, journaling has increased in
          popularity. Today you will discover journaling crossing gender
          and generational lines, as well as being a self-discovery
          /cheap therapy for many people to work through personal
          issues, family crisis and as part of the process of grieving.
          Frequently used situationally, journaling is also a life-path
          sounding board for those who consider doing journaling as
          important as their morning coffee.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Partly, those who don't journal want to know what to write
          about, but they are also asking what can possible be so
          important as to spend money on bound books of blank pages and
          fancy expensive pens with your name engraved on them. What you
          write about are considered personal tools, while what you
          write with are considered practical tools. Personal tools are
          abundant because they are what life is made of: thoughts,
          feelings, ideas, experiences, everyday issues, world events,
          community situations, faith issues and relationships among all
          of these, are personal tools with which to establish, nurture
          and continue your journaling process. <br>
          <br>
          If you are happy using the cheapest pens and paper you can
          find, have at it. If you like pretty, bound books, fountain
          pens and colored markers to create companion illustrations,
          you will have a great time journaling too. I personally have
          one foot in both camps. I use bound, unlined books purchased
          en masse at clearance sales, and any pen that feels good
          moving across the paper. I am, however, not opposed to leather
          bound books and elegant pens if I have the financial resources
          and the luck to find them.<br>

          Unless you already journal regularly, it is difficult to
          imagine squeezing one more task into your day, especially one
          that can feel quite daunting in its newness. Journaling is a
          habit like any other activity you do on a regular basis. And,
          like any other addition to our lives, we make the time if we
          are serious about wanting to do it. Frequency, length of your
          journaling sessions and the amount of pages you would like to
          journal are all up to you. Each writer is on her/his own path,
          and has the luxurious responsibility of choosing these ways of
          framing their journaling experience to create the results they
          want.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Whenever they can. There is no right time of day to journal,
          although there are times that are better for you than others,
          perhaps different times on different days. What i believe is
          most important is to commit to the journaling itself, then map
          out when you will journal, so you don't pretend with yourself
          that you will get to it when time comes available. It doesn't,
          and you and I both know that. <br>
          <br>
          Be honest with yourself, look at your schedule and figure out
          the ways you can carve out time for yourself to do this. Maybe
          you are a morning person and you would do well getting up
          thirty minutes earlier to write a few days a week. Or perhaps
          your children nap at a fairly regular time and you would enjoy
          that as some adult time for yourself. <br>
          <br>
          Perhaps in the evening, when your home is settled in, is a
          peaceful, reflective time that suits you. Journals can also be
          brought on vacation to record your experiences, special events
          and these events as they relate to your everyday life.<br>
          <br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Most people who ask this question cannot conceive of making
          space in their lives, let alone space in their homes, to
          create a journaling experience. Sometimes knowing the writing
          location helps ground a journaler, connects her/him to the
          place and the process. The three guiding principles here are
          privacy, intention and comfort. You may have plenty of desks
          and tables in your home, but you will need to scope out which
          spaces provide you with quiet and no interruptions. <br>
          <br>
          Choosing that spot and making it your own, perhaps with a
          storage space for your practical tools, will help you keep
          connected to this new adventure in your life. Making the
          space, comfortable, even if it is in a corner of the least
          used room in the house, with a simple chair, table, a seat
          cushion and a pretty candle, can give you a great boost to
          creating this experience for yourself. It can also be fun to
          take your journal to a favorite coffee shop or park to change
          your surroundings and to stimulate your senses.<br>
          <br>
          The great gift of journaling is two fold. In creating a
          journaling life for yourself, you sow the abundance of life
          and reap its benefits for yourself ten times over. A conscious
          life, well-lived, is also a blessing of immeasurable worth to
          those around you. You simply cannot lose when you give
          yourself the gift of journaling.<br>
