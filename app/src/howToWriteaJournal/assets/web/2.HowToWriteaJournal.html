          Journaling is one of the most valuable tools for gaining
          insight into who you truly are at your core and growing
          confidence. Whatever major change you seek - whether it's in
          your career, relationships, athletic performance or any other
          area that matters to you - you simply can not move forward
          with purpose and intention unless (and until) you begin to
          understand the inner workings of your own personality.
          Greatness is about attitude, positive thinking and creating
          environments that best serve your own ends. We all have
          greatness within us and it's up to us to draw it out.<br>
          <br>
          Keeping a confidence journal leads to deeper
          self-understanding. Success in both life and work directly
          relate to how we see ourselves on the inside. We need to see
          ourselves on the inside the way we want others to view us on
          the outside. Our self-image (how we see and think about
          ourselves) has a profound effect on how other people perceive
          us, even though it may not be the impression we want to
          convey. <br>
          <br>
          Look at your inner self. Do you consistently see yourself as a
          follower or as a leader? Do you have optimistic or pessimistic
          attitudes and/or behaviors? How do you answer the question: Is
          the glass 1/2 empty or 1/2 full? Perhaps it is just right the
          way it is. What inner thoughts occupy your mind? Do you
          consider yourself to have a positive or negative outlook? Do
          you believe people can change their attitude? Do you need or
          want to change any of your habits or attitudes? How do these
          questions relate to your current state of confidence as well
          as where you want to go? Writing down what you want and who
          you want to be will help make it happen.<br>
          <br>
          - Think about the past 6-12 months and ask yourself: How have
          I grown as a person? What qualities have I strengthened or
          developed? Am I more patient, focused, financially
          responsible, open-minded or provocative? Have I been able to
          set (and protect) my boundaries? <br>
          <br>
          - How has my environment improved? Have I cleaned up my home
          or office, created order out of chaos or challenged myself to
          throw things out? <br>
          <br>
          - What am I tolerating? <br>
          <br>
          - Have I reduced my debt? <br>
          <br>
          - Do I feel more connected to those things that make me feel
          passionate? Have I identified any interests or activities that
          ignite my passion? What positive steps have I taken to pursue
          these interests? <br>
          <br>
          - Am I better able to see the humor in difficult situations? <br>
          <br>
          - How am I taking better care of myself? What have I done to
          effectively manage my mood or reduce my feelings of overwhelm?
          <br>
          <br>
          - What have I done to help others improve the quality of their
          lives? <br>
          <br>
          - Describe 5 times when you have overcome crises in your life.
          Which of your strengths did you draw on to overcome each
          crisis? What effect did the outcome have on you and your life?
          <br>
          <br>
          - Describe 10 times when you were proud of yourself. <br>
          <br>
          - What are you afraid of right now? <br>
          <br>
          - Make a list of all your accomplishments - big and small! <br>
          <br>
          - Describe your perfect life: What would it look/feel like?
          Who would be in it? What possessions would you have? Where
          would you live? What work would you do? What kind of vacations
          would you take? What personal qualities would you have? What
          would your experiences be? Include things you already have in
          your life that you want to keep as well as things you don't
          yet have but want. <br>
          <br>
          - Identify 10 life adventures or experiences that excite you <br>
          <br>
          - where would you want to go? What do you want to learn, feel
          or be able to do? - How attached are you to what other people
          think? Can you let go of the constant need for the approval of
          others? Ask yourself: What have I missed out on simply because
          I was too afraid of what others would think if I stepped out
          ahead of them? <br>
          <br>
          - Create a Journal WOW Page: Great things happen all the time
          that we are wowed by, although sometimes we don't take the
          time to notice and truly appreciate these events. Keep track
          of the WOW occurrences in your life so you can take the time
          to absorb them. Your WOW journal page is a great place to turn
          to when you have a day that doesn't go your way and you need a
          confidence boost.<br>
          <br>
          - Create a Journal GRATITUDE Page: Having an attitude of
          gratitude is the first step in creating the joyful life that
          is perfect for you. Until we learn to appreciate what we
          already have, we won't appreciate (and sometimes won't even
          notice) that which we receive. Take time each day to write
          down at least one thing for which you are grateful. <br>
          <br>
          - Create a 100 THINGS I Want to Experience/Accomplish in My
          Life Page: If you can dream it, you can achieve it. Consider
          this your dream sheet for what you would like to have happen
          in your life. Be creative, be outrageous and most of all don't
          be practical. It may not seem possible at this very moment,
          however, we never know what the next moment might bring. The
          bigger your dreams the more compelling reason you have for
          becoming more confident. <br>
          <br>
          - DISCOVER YOUR TALENT: To discover your unique gifts and
          talents, you need to spend some time focusing specifically on
          what they may be. What are the things you truly love to do?
          What do you think MIGHT be your talent? What situations do you
          get completely involved in? Lose complete track of time? Can
          do forever and never get tired? Knowing your talents and being
          proud of them builds confidence.<br>
