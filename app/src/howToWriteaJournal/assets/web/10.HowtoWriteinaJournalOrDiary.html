          The easiest way to begin your writing career is to write in a
          journal or diary. In fact, a blog which is a web log is an
          online diary. There's no right or wrong way to write in a
          journal or diary. Your journal or diary is personal. You write
          your deepest thoughts in it. These are your thoughts which you
          may not be ready to share with anyway. This is okay. However,
          one day, you may want to turn your journal into a best-selling
          novel or non-fiction book.<br>
          <br>
          First, purchase a journal or diary. Choose one that you'd want
          to write in every day and or every night. Purchase a pen that
          is special and feels right to you when you hold it in your
          hand. Title your entries with the date; you may want put the
          time on it as well. If you're on vacation, write down the
          city, state, and country. You can always give your journal
          entry a title as well.<br>
          <br>
          Second, write in the first person. Most journals and diaries
          are written in the first person because it's about you.
          However, you may want to take on a persona and release your
          feelings through this pseudo. Who are they? What are their
          characteristics? This may sound foreign to some but for others
          it will make sense.<br>
          <br>
          Third, use descriptive words. If you're on vacation and are
          writing about your trip, use adjectives that make an impact.
          Where are you? Are you in Paris? What does it look like? For
          example, if you visited the Eiffel Tower, you may want to
          write, "Today, I went to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Looking
          out at the city made me dizzy with fear but apart of me felt
          electric because I could feel the energy of the city pulsating
          below my feet." A reader will understand that while you may
          have had a fear of heights, you realized that being at the top
          of the Eiffel Tower was exciting and looking at the city
          touched you deeply. Descriptive words will bring your writing
          to life.<br>
          <br>
          Fourth, think about how you feel? What is your emotional
          state? Get everything out onto the paper. Don't hold back. Let
          it rip because if you're holding onto anger, fear,
          frustration, or other emotions, they'll be released from your
          consciousness. This will benefit you because you'll no longer
          hold onto these emotions that could wreak havoc on your life.<br>
          <br>
          Fifth, there's nothing wrong with typing your journal but most
          people say it's better to hand write your journal or diary.
          Choose the method that's right for you. If you're not sure,
          you could start writing your journal on your computer and then
          write it in a journal book. Notice how you feel in your body.
          Does it feel better to type on the computer or write in a
          journal book? You're doing this for you and no one else --
          choose what's best for you.<br>
          <br>
          The key to writing is you need to write. That's it! If you
          don't write every day or night then you won't accomplish
          anything. You can write about whatever is your heart's desire.
          If you suffered a traumatic event, write about it and purge
          your feelings. If you're experiencing joy in your life, write
          about that. Write, write, and write. It's that simple!<br>
