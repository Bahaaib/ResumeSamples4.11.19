          <br>
          In today's world, it seems that almost any topic is open for
          debate. While I was gathering facts for this article, I was
          quite surprised to find some of the issues I thought were
          settled are actually still being openly discussed.<br>
          How do you begin journaling? How do you know what to write?<br>
          <br>
          How do you find time? There are many questions when it comes
          to keeping a journal and someone who may not have ever done it
          before may have problems trying to see themselves doing it
          now.<br>
          <br>
          Another question is why. Why should I do this? How will it
          benefit me and what is the point? Well, the biggest way in
          which keeping a journal can help you is that you can reduce
          the stress in your life.<br>
          <br>
          Journaling has been proven as a method of reducing stress,
          improving the immune system and helping with certain diseases
          and conditions. Journaling can reduce your stress and your
          chances of depression and prevent the need for medication.<br>
          <br>
          It's really a good idea to probe a little deeper into the
          subject of journaling. What you learn may give you the
          confidence you need to venture into new areas.<br>
          <br>
          You do not really need to know anything about journaling to
          begin. There is no right or wrong way. You can simply pick up
          a pen and paper and begin. It's not really that easy for many
          people, though. That's why new methods have been designed to
          help people.<br>
          <br>
          There is excellent journaling software that makes the whole
          process simple for you. You just open the program and begin
          typing. The software dates it for you and times it if you want
          and even offers you writing prompts to help you express
          yourself. Those writing prompts can be especially helpful as
          you are just beginning to journal when you are not so sure
          what to write.<br>
          <br>
          You want your journal to be more than just a diary of what you
          did that day. You want it to be a way to express your emotions
          and work through how they make you feel. You want it to be a
          safe place to communicate and problem solve. To explore
          thoughts you normally don't have time to notice. Journaling
          will become a growing experience for you in which you get to
          know yourself better.<br>
          <br>
          You will then be healthier and happier and possibly even
          stress free!<br>
          <br>
          Knowing enough about journaling to make solid, informed
          choices cuts down on the fear factor. If you apply what you've
          just learned about journaling, you should have nothing to
          worry about.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          1.Set your journal or diary where you will see it everyday,
          i.e., on your nightstand, at your desk, where you have coffee.
          This will help to remind you to journal.<br>
          <br>
          2.Part of keeping a journal, is skipping a day, a week, and
          even months.<br>
          <br>
          3.Writing a word, sentences, or paragraphs, journaling
          whatever you have to say that day is just the right amount to
          write.<br>
          <br>
          4.Journal whatever is important for you to write about right
          then and there. I've journaled about a fabulous soup I ate, my
          concerns about a friendship, my dreams for the future.<br>
          <br>
          5.Keeping your journal private. That can mean setting
          boundaries with those in your home, it may mean hiding it, or
          locking it away. You will have to make an individual decision
          about what that means to you.<br>
          <br>
          6.Re-read your journal or not. Rarely do I re-read my
          journals. Some people always read what they have written.
          Again it is a personal choice.<br>
          <br>
          7.Remember to use your journal for your benefit and well
          being, what ever that that means to you. Keeping a journal is
          a powerful tool that you can give to yourself everyday. Plus,
          this creates time for you every day.<br>
