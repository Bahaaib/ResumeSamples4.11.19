          Do you know that many people who successfully lose large
          amounts of weight and are also successful at keeping it off
          use a journal? This is no ordinary journal though. It is a
          food loss journal and using it can ensure total success no
          matter what your weight loss goal may be.<br>
          <br>
          Never underestimated the power of a food journal. Using it
          daily will ensure you become much more conscious of your
          current bad eating habits. Through its use you can identify
          the cause of your weight problems.<br>
          <br>
          So what is a food journal?<br>
          <br>
          Well it is simply a small book you carry with you everywhere
          you go for at least two weeks. After this you can store it
          some place safe and refer to it three times a day.<br>
          <br>
          So here is a quick explanation of a food journal:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Week 1 -</b><br>
          <br>
          In your journal on the first page note your current weight.
          Now for the rest of the week you must make a note of
          everything you eat during the day. This is why it is so
          important to carry the small book with you at all times. You
          must be disciplined in this. Every time you eat anything, even
          a small piece of meat or a nibble you must enter exactly what
          you ate and the time at which it was eaten. Then describe your
          motivations for eating it. Where you really hungry? Was the
          temptation of it being there too much? Where you feeling
          lonely or stressed? Take a note of all the feelings that lead
          you to eat the food.<br>
          <br>
          At breakfast, lunch and dinner list all the foods you ate, why
          you ate them and how you felt before, during and after you ate
          them. Also note every bit of exercise to take during the day.
          It doesn’t matter how small it is just jot it down anyway.
          Also note when you went to the shops or to pick up the kids or
          just to get a message. Did you take the car or bus? Describe
          how you were feeling prior to taking the car or bus. Why
          didn’t you walk? Was it too far? Did you not have enough time?<br>
          <br>
          <b>Week 2 -</b><br>
          <br>
          Write down your current weight and follow the plan outlined
          for week 1. In addition, you can now start to analyse your
          journal.<br>
          <br>
          Look over your entries for the previous week and the amount of
          food you ate. What type of food where you eating. Why were you
          eating it? For example you may have noted that you ate a
          chocolate bar at 1pm because you were feeling bored. You
          notice that this is a recurring theme almost everyday. So, go
          to your empty journal entries for week three and pencil in at
          the same time of day an activity that will relieve your
          boredom. If you can’t think of one then pencil in that you
          will go for a walk or start to do that odd job you have been
          putting off for months!<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps you ate the chocolate because it gave you a certain
          feeling you enjoyed. Look at the feeling. Is there anything
          else you could do that would make you feel the same or a
          similar way? There are always alternatives. Jot one down in
          your journal!<br>
          <br>
          Maybe you notice that the temptation to eat the chocolate was
          too strong to resist because it was just there. Pencil into
          your journal, on your shopping day, that you are to buy no
          chocolate!<br>
          <br>
          Now look at your exercise activities for the previous week.
          When did you take the car when you could have walked? Could
          you pencil in an extra 15 minutes walking a day. Divide the 15
          minutes into three 5 minute exercises, this way it will not
          seem like that much of a change. Park the car 5 minutes away
          from the shop. Walk to a bus stop that is 5 minutes further
          away. Did you not have enough time? Structure your journal to
          compensate, even if it means getting up 15 minutes earlier.<br>
          <br>
          In this way you can use your journal to set out a plan for the
          coming week. Be strict with yourself and follow your plan.
          Tick off the things on your journal one by one as you complete
          them. Pencil in activities that you have always wanted to do.
          You will find that organising your food intake and exercise
          routine in this way will have a major knock-on effect on the
          rest of your life. You are getting organised!<br>
          <br>
          Your food journal is a also great way of tracking your
          progress. Make sure you note in it all your accomplishments
          and list all your weight loss achievements. When you reach
          week 3 you can begin using your journal only 3 times a day -
          once in the morning to check your schedule for the day. Once
          after dinner to note your activities during the day and once
          at night to review your progress that day and structure the
          same day for the following week.<br>
          <br>
          It is important to reward yourself every time you succeed at a
          task that you have put in your journal. Pencil in that at the
          end of a certain week you will buy yourself new clothes.
          Constantly review your achievements and give yourself credit
          for having done so well. This will keep you motivated and
          ensure you keep to your plan, continue using your journal and
          of course keep your weight healthy.<br>
