          1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Online advertising</b> - On the
          Internet, a smartly organized small business may get excellent
          results, often competing side by side with larger
          corporations. Internet advertising is on an ascending trend,
          which shows plenty of potential for the near and distant
          future. As traditional media outlets struggle to keep costs
          down and become more attractive for potential advertisers, the
          virtual space offers any business the opportunity to achieve
          amazing results with a budget that is only a fraction of what
          an advertiser would pay to get the same ROI through
          traditional media. Using programs such as Google Adsense,
          placing affiliate banners on your site and making the most out
          of pixel advertising are all amazing ways to make some money.<br>
          <br>
          2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Affiliate programs</b> - You can
          choose affiliate hubs where different advertisers offer their
          banners and affiliate offers and you can manage them using a
          centralized system, or you can get a single affiliate website
          that will display their banners on your site. The potential
          profits that come from affiliate programs are strictly
          connected to how high your visitor counts are and how targeted
          those visitors are. This takes us a bit away from affiliate
          systems and highlights the importance of SEO in any online
          business. The web masters who invest money and energy into
          ethical SEO techniques often notice a very steady increase in
          traffic, which, in turn, enables them to make more profit from
          their online business.<br>
          <br>
          3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;Freelance jobs</b> - Working as a
          freelancer on the Internet is one of the most popular ways of
          making money from home. You can try your luck at graphic
          design, copywriting, programming and several other dozens of
          ramifications and project types.<br>
          <br>
          4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Electronic commerce</b> – selling
          items on eBay is one of the hottest ways of making a lot of
          cash online. Not everyone is successful at it, of course, but
          those that are continue to increase their profits constantly.
          Auctions on eBay have a lot of potential – combine them with
          dropshipping and you can get a business that’s easy to run and
          very profitable at the same time.<br>
          <br>
          5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Work at home jobs</b> - Depending on
          how much time you are willing to put into a work at home
          opportunity, you could either do it in your spare time, or
          make it your main income source. Work at home jobs are
          suitable for everyone: from students, to retired people. You
          do not sign any documents or commit in writing to anything,
          thus you are not obliged to work if you do not feel like it.
          In a modern society, with parents spending more time at home
          raising their children and college students looking for a
          comfortable part time job, a work at home opportunity is the
          perfect answer.<br>
          <br>
          6.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;Outsourcing</b> – this is not a
          moneymaking opportunity, but a money saving one. Outsourcing
          is the best way to create a competitive business in countries
          like the United States, Canada and most of Europe.<br>
          <br>
          7.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;Free stuff online</b> – you will not
          get rich while taking advantage of all the free stuff you can
          get online, but it is fun and rewarding. If you are a
          webmaster and you wish to create a very popular website, do
          your best to offer lots of things for free – downloads,
          software, ebooks, wallpapers and so on.<br>
