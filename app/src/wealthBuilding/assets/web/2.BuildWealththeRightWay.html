          If you are reading this you probably are looking for a way to
          improve an important aspect of your life; your financial
          position. The idea of getting rich quick is grand but the
          possibility that it will happen overnight is slim. The
          programs you can find are often sold to the general population
          by a company looking to mass market information in order to
          generate a profit. If there were an easy button or magic
          potion, wouldn't we all be rich by now? What it takes to get
          rich is working hard and working smart. Let's not discount the
          fact that there are individuals that have hit the lottery or
          developed a product that put them in the millionaire's club
          seemingly overnight but their numbers are few.<br>
          <br>
          Then where can you start? The first steps to improving your
          financial position and building wealth is awareness and
          action. <br>
          <br>
          <b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Know Your Current Situation. </b><br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;If you are going to build something you have to start
          with a strong foundation. It is important to understand what
          money you have coming in and were it goes every month. I
          suggest you keep a spending journal for one month. Every day,
          jot down everything you spend. Be it paying bills, buying
          food, entertainment, it doesn't matter what it is, if it costs
          money, write it down. Knowing your current situation will help
          you determine if you income is higher than your expenditures.
          Once you have determined where your money is going, you may be
          surprised at how much you are spending on things that is
          absolutely worthless. I personally liked my coffee in the
          morning; I determined that I spent over $1000.00 a year on my
          daily stops to the gas station. That is insane, and I couldn't
          even account for the many times I would grab a pop or a
          granola bar. It all adds up. I switched to making coffee in
          the morning before I left; cutting the cost by a huge amount
          and stopping me from making those mindless purchases that
          drained my available cash.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Understand Your Debt</b><br>
          <br>
          Debt has been accepted and encouraged by society as a way of
          life. This way of thinking is contradictory to building your
          wealth. Money owed reduces your net worth and is a barrier
          between you and saving money. There are different types of
          debt. First, make a list of all debt that you owe. Categorize
          the list into these sections. A. Home mortgages and
          transportation. B. Credit cards and anything that generates
          interest that increases the debt level. C. Anything late or
          potentially damaging to your credit. D. Miscellaneous debt
          such as that loan from Aunt Maggie last year. Once it is
          categorized, it will be easier to gain a perspective on the
          actions that you will need to take. Your priority should be
          taking care of any debt that is currently late, damaging your
          credit, or growing due to high interest and minimum payments.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Work To Eliminate Debt</b><br>
          <br>
          I know, I am telling you to spend your money when you are
          trying to get more of it but trust me; this is the real way to
          get rich! You took the time hopefully to list your debt into
          the different categories. Now, take anything that is late and
          make it your priority. If everything is current, knock out any
          small bills that you can eliminate quickly. These small
          successes will keep you motivated and free up what you have
          available to pay down on the larger debt. Pick a debt to begin
          to focus on. My best advice is to choose the debt that is
          charging the highest amount of interest. The more you pay
          down, the less they will be tacking on in interest at the end
          of every billing cycle. <br>
          <br>
          <b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Know Your Credit Score</b><br>
          <br>
          Your credit score affects many aspects of your life beside
          your ability to get a loan. Opening accounts and getting a job
          just to name a few. Your payment history along with debt level
          and public information such as a bankruptcy all play a part in
          the score. I strongly suggest you get a copy of your credit
          report and review it for errors. You can log on to
          http://www.annualcreditreport.com for a free copy of your
          credit report. Also, there are sites available to help you
          obtain and manage your credit report for different varying
          fees. If your credit needs work or if you had problems with
          identity theft, I suggest you begin working with one of these
          organizations. You need to know what is on that report,
          everyone else does.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Eliminate Hidden Costs</b><br>
          <br>
          Any drain on your available cash will add up over time. Making
          a payment late that generates a fee, annual fees on credit
          cards, monthly fees for bank accounts are all unnecessary.
          Review each account to see if they are taking on any charges.
          Paying a fee for a checking account is ludicrous these days.
          The banks are competing for your business. You can find many
          accounts by searching the internet, no fees, some with higher
          yield interest rates if you open a checking account at the
          same time, others have programs available that reward you for
          simply doing business with them. If you have open lines of
          credit search for options to transfer into a lower interest
          rate, any reduction in continuing expenses are a few more
          dollars toward your financial success. Avoid doing a debt
          consolidation loan that stretches your payments out for longer
          periods, yes it looks good on paper, lower payments and even
          lower interest but averaged out over time it will cost more in
          interest.<br>
          <br>
          <b>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Plan For Emergencies</b><br>
          <br>
          Many experts say that you should have at least three months
          worth of living expenses put away. Reality has most of us
          living paycheck to paycheck. When something like a car repair
          comes up, we find ourselves putting off important payments in
          order to get the emergency taken care of forcing a game of
          catch up often times for months after. Start with a lower
          amount. Have a garage sale, sell stuff that you really don't
          need, do whatever it takes to set aside $1000.00 for
          emergencies. Statistics show that having that amount set aside
          will often take care of the emergencies that crop up. The
          emergency fund should be held where it is not accessible for
          simple purchases and no, pizza and a movie are not constituted
          as an emergency. If you find yourself having to dip into the
          emergency fund, stop paying extra on the debt until you have
          replenished it.<br>
          <br>
          <b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set Goals</b><br>
          <br>
          Having a plan is the only way to work for something. How often
          would you jump in your car to go on vacation without a
          destination in mind? It may sound like fun but at some point
          you are going to have to make a decision. So why on earth we
          try to stumble through life without a plan is beyond me. Goal
          setting can be kind of scary. Why? Because you are committing
          yourself to accomplish something that we are not quite sure
          how we are going to get there, so the fear of failure comes
          into play. Its ok, everyone goes through it. Write down what
          you would like to achieve. Make them big because you are going
          set some time limitations and plan the actions that you need
          to take to get there, one step at a time. That is how we
          learned to walk isn't it? <br>
          <br>
          Break down each goal into actions that have to occur in order
          to accomplish it. Make sure that each action is not
          complicated, if there is more than one thing that has to
          happen to finish the action, break it down further. Write down
          tentative deadlines for achieving each action. Leave room next
          to the date to write down when the action actually was
          completed. Post your goals somewhere that you will read them
          every day. I like to suggest the refrigerator. I know I visit
          mine frequently enough! This is your map. Review them monthly
          to add or modify, we know that life brings about surprises,
          good and bad, we have to be able to adapt. Finally, talk about
          your goals, vocalizing them will further cement your
          commitment to them and to yourself. If you find that people
          are negative toward your desire to change your situation,
          realize that often times they are jealous of your motivation
          and truly want the same for themselves.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn to Save</b><br>
          <br>
          As you begin to pay down your debt, you should be finding
          yourself with more available cash. An aggressive goal for
          saving money would be 10% of your income. It is hard to save
          as often times when bills are getting paid we feel a sense of
          freedom and want to enjoy the finer things in life. That is
          ok, after you have met the goal of saving money. I myself,
          being a normal American, have a tough time committing money to
          savings; it is easier if I am working toward something. My
          goal of purchasing a home is my motivator. That still doesn't
          seem to work all the time, so I have found avenues to increase
          my saving. I found a bank account that every time I use my
          debit card, it rounds my purchase to an even amount and
          transfers the change into my savings account. The really cool
          thing about it is the bank actually matches the amount up to
          $250.00 per year. Folks that is free money! <br>
          <br>
          <b>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adjust To Set-Backs</b><br>
          <br>
          Let's face it, stuff does happen. When the unexpected occurs,
          you have to be diligent enough to sit down and re-work your
          plan of action. Whether a major set back or something minor,
          it is very easy for us to throw our hands up and give up the
          fight. It may be tough but remember, procrastination and
          complacency are evil monsters and often times the reason we
          find ourselves in situations that are undesirable. Rework your
          budget, rework your goals, rework your commitment, but do not
          give up. You wanted to build wealth right? Very little worth
          having comes easily regardless of the get rich quick programs
          you can buy for $29.99 on the internet. Who is getting rich
          when you buy one of those anyway? Don't take my word for it,
          just look at where you are and see what has worked the best
          for you so far.<br>
          <br>
          <b>10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start Today</b><br>
          <br>
          In closing, I want to touch base on when you should start.
          TODAY!!! It is human nature to pick a time and date to create
          a basis of measurement. That is fine but why put two more
          weeks out of your new life to wait for the first of the month?
          Make the commitment to yourself to begin making changes now.
          Like I had mentioned earlier, every small success, every bill
          that goes away, will increase your motivation and confidence.
          So resolve not to resolve any longer, planning is yet another
          form of procrastination. I am a planner and a list maker. If I
          had back every minute that I spent on planning and poured that
          into action, I would be more than 50% closer to achieving my
          goals. Keep positive and good luck!<br>
