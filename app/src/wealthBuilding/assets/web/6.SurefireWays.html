          The money making tips are by no means in chronological order
          but are in a sparse format just like my brain so sorry for not
          categorizing this content but its not too bad for 100% free
          information. Disclaimer: Free information, no promises of
          increase of income by reading this info What you do with this
          information is your decision and even though i want everyone
          who read this to make massive money i cant guarantee any
          result of income.<br>
          <br>
          1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write an info product for a well
          established niche, this is one of the easiest ways that i use
          to constantly make money online :). If your info product has
          anything new or innovative then it should sell well. However,
          just don't write the ebook! Build a business. Gather visitors
          emails that comes to your site and offer them complimentary
          products through affiliate programs. Go ahead and offer
          upsells, and backends, and memberships for recurring income.
          If your just offering an ebook your leaving potential of
          thousands and thousands of dollars right on the dinner table,
          don't think of it as "YES! I made a sale," think of it as a
          real business and increasing the amount of profits you make
          per sale. <br>
          <br>
          2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start your own online country, thats
          right. What i mean by this is basically your own unique online
          community that is catered towards a group of people that
          allows them to share content and information with each other.
          Look at myspace, facebook, and youtube. Million and Billion
          dollar ideas in just a couple of years.<br>
          <br>
          3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Build your virtual real estate. I'm not
          too much of a AdSense site type of guy, im into building
          businesses instead, I prefer making social networking sites
          that will gather people's attention... and a good way to go
          about this is make it FREE, thats the magic word. Once you get
          people to register to your site you can then allow them to
          share it with their friends which will help make your site
          grow bigger. If your website is getting traffic then you can
          monetize off this with AdSense or by selling advertising which
          can be a killer money maker by you literally doing nothing.<br>
          <br>
          4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Help a friend get a job. Its funny while
          your out to start working for yourself, you are out to know
          help connect people you know with better jobs. Many people are
          looking for jobs, just take for instance craigslist one of the
          most populated websites in the world has a large section for
          connecting employers and job seekers. Also, monster.com is
          also a huge network for connecting employers with job seekers
          as well. If you can help connect someone then the rewards
          could be huge, as big as in the 1000 range, not really no
          chicken change. <br>
          <br>
          5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Advertise and sell other people's
          products from your website which is known as affiliate
          marketing which is such a hot field because people are looking
          for ways to make money online without having their own
          product, and this is one that you can accomplish this. Some
          affiliate networks to check are commission junction, amazon,
          and linkshare. The popular one for selling digital product is
          clickbank. <br>
          <br>
          6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sell yourself :). Now, don't get it the
          wrong way. There are some sites online known as freelance
          services in which web masters or companies will pay you money
          if you do certain tasks for them. If you can build websites,
          program, or do any other technical skills then join these
          sites.<br>
          <br>
          7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write. This is something that anyone can
          do and there are no technical skills required except being
          able to use the computer and research. Look for writing jobs
          on freelance services. It will help to have a portfolio of
          some of your writings in order to help increase your chances
          of getting chosen.<br>
          <br>
          8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do you take pictures? You can sell
          licenses to web masters or individuals to use the photos that
          you take and you can usually charge a good amount for these as
          well.<br>
          <br>
          9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assist businesses. Yes, businesses and
          web masters always need help and you can help them with
          everyday tasks by becoming their virtual assistant. <br>
          <br>
          10.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Know something about a subject and love
          to talk? Well, you will love blogging. Blog about the topic
          and write in a manner that attracts people. You can monetize
          your site with adsense, sell affiliate programs, sell
          advertising, you name it. http://www.blogger.com is a free
          blogging software.<br>
          <br>
          11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Don't know a thing? No worries you are
          not alone, but that shouldn't stop you from blogging as it
          doesn't stop others, you can still make money just by blogging
          on topics that are interesting. You can blog about your
          everyday tasks, blog about your plans to lose weight, or blog
          about your plans to make money. Some marketers have started
          money making challenges such as the 30K challenge, or Willie
          Crawford's 1 million in 90 days challenge. These type of
          challenges can gather huge interests in people.<br>
          <br>
          12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fill a need. I own and frequent many
          forums and i have come to a conclusion that people love to
          complain. Thats great! Whatever they are complaining about
          provide them a solution, this equals more money in your
          wallet.<br>
          <br>
          13.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make money by managing domain names. For
          example, domain name services like sedo and afternic gets paid
          just for regulating domain names. This can be nice steady
          income for having no products to sell yourself, or by not even
          selling other people's products... but just by being the
          middleman.<br>
          <br>
          14.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Buy and resell domain names for quick
          cash. I once purchased a domain name at the right time and
          then flipped it for $200. Domain name flipping takes some time
          to master like any other skill though. <br>
          <br>
          15.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Purchase a domain name, build up the pr
          (pagerank), gain backlinks, and then sell the domain name. If
          you can get a pr6 domain name then you should be able to sell
          this for a hundred or two on ebay.<br>
          <br>
          16.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can find a domain name that is
          keyword rich and is getting steady traffic then purchase it
          and park it and watch the money come in overtime.<br>
          <br>
          17.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Build a house and flip it. By this i
          mean purchase a domain name and build a website for it and
          then try and sell it for profit. A popular site to sell
          websites is sitepoint: http://www.sitepoint.com/<br>
          <br>
          18.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Get paid to post in forums. I would only
          recommend this if you're looking for quick side cash because
          this is by no means a way to make a killing online. Some web
          masters will pay individuals to make posts at forums.
          Sometimes, an individual has a new forum up and running and
          want to get it active so they will pay individuals to post
          there under multiple usernames. Or, web masters could pay
          individuals to post on forums so that they can get more
          traffic to their website through signatures. Or, a webmaster
          could be the owner of a forum and pay forum users for each
          post they make in order to help them stay, and in order to
          help build up traffic to the forum as well. <br>
          <br>
          19.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go ahead and try to start your own
          article directory, but you better do something to make it
          unique and beneficial to the article submitter. Whats going to
          make an individual submit to your article directory as opposed
          to ones that they are accustom to submitting to and "plus" get
          results with. The good news is most of the other article
          directories are doing pretty much the same exact thing that
          everyone else is doing, you just have to be that much
          different and find your unique positioning. <br>
          <br>
          20.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn the ins and outs about a large
          network and teach people how to use it effectively, become an
          expert in that field. For example, look at ebay. Even though
          it may be simple to use to the average Internet browser, there
          are still tons of people offline that has no idea about the
          ins or outs about it. This can be an easy way to make some
          extra money. Some offline services charge people a whopping
          sum of money just to sell their products for them on ebay, so
          that is something for you to think about.<br>
          <br>
          21.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Think of a crazy innovative idea that's
          newsworthy. Ever heard of the milliondollarhomepage,
          http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com selling worthless links?
          Well, it got in the news and people swarmed to the site, proof
          that its not incredibly hard to make big money online.<br>
          <br>
          22.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Moderate forums, some forums get crazy
          traffic and some of them also get crazy amounts of spam that
          needs to be moderated...badly.<br>
          <br>
          23.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make funny videos and then register for
          an account here thevideosense.com and post them.<br>
          <br>
          24.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are technical then offer support
          for software programs especially wordpress. People are always
          having issues with this software and there is money to be made
          by installing and customizing wordpress blogs.<br>
          <br>
          25.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you like surfing the Internet then
          AGLOCO is a program that pays you for your browsing
          information (at the stake of your privacy though). You will
          need to download their tool bar into your desktop.<br>
          <br>
          26.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sell tools and useful items to myspace
          users like templates, layouts, and backgrounds. Too many
          marketers try to spam this service which is against their tos,
          so just build real friends and sell them cheap items that they
          can use on myspace, easy money! Make money on myspace by
          selling users things that they can use while they are on
          myspace. <br>
          <br>
          27.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write a newsletter and im talking about
          a real one. A list of subscribers is an incredible asset for
          your business because you can keep selling to those people
          over and over again but at least give some good content
          instead of only emailing when you have something to promote.
          You can promote your products as long as affiliates once you
          build trust with your subscribers. <br>
          <br>
          28.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Build your own forum. There are plenty
          of free scripts out there that will aid you in the process
          such as phpbb: http://www.phpbb.com/downloads/ or
          simplemachines: http://www.simplemachines.org/download/. This
          is an incredible way to monetize on giving something away for
          free. When people register they will enter their email and
          this is an unorthodox way to build a list. Not only that but
          you can build multiple streams of income by selling
          advertising as well as monetizing the forum with adsense.
          Heck, you can even offer products as discounts to forum
          members, sell your own products, offer co-registration, the
          options are limitless.<br>
          <br>
          29.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn seo (search engine optimization),
          it can be very profitable for you in the long run. Web masters
          tend to be too busy and that is one reason why many do not get
          where they want, they cant manage their time too well. So, you
          can offer to get web masters links to their sites by writing
          and submitting articles to directories and even optimizing
          their pages for them. <br>
          <br>
          30.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start selling on ebay, eBay is a
          goldmine. See what is currently selling hot here
          http://pulse.ebay.com/ and see if you can find any whole
          sellers with these items an affordable rate. Make sure that
          you're dealing with a reputable seller because there are many
          scams in this industry so beware. <br>
          <br>
          31.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Create an award website. Awards have
          been tested to increase the credibility of a website (which
          equals more money) so make a website with a fancy logo and
          offer it to web masters that meet your award's standards.<br>
          <br>
          32.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make money online by researching and
          finding statistics, facts, or quotes for individuals that
          needs them.<br>
          <br>
          33.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write articles. Some networks will give
          you money for how many view certain articles that you write
          get. Here is one such network:
          http://www.associatedcontent.com/.<br>
          <br>
          34.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn the ins and outs of myspace, a lot
          of web masters are looking for people to do marketing for them
          on myspace and if you know about this network then you can
          make some money by offering your expertise.<br>
          <br>
          35.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make money by referring individuals to
          paypal and ebay. Yes, these both have affiliate programs
          (doesn't pay much) but this could be an easy way to make money
          if you know people that are looking for ways to make money
          online.<br>
          <br>
          36.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try using Co registration to generate
          some money online. What this means is that a company or
          service will pay you money when you can generate a lead for
          them. For example, you place a text banner on your site and
          once the individual clicks they will usually be sent to a form
          in which they can enter their personal information, and once
          they have done that you get paid for it. Its obvious that to
          get people to enter their "personal information" online you
          must have an incentive offer or copy, because people are
          fearful of spam (i am too). However, this shouldn't discourage
          you because this is very possible though. Some companies are
          so good at this that they get people to enter their credit
          card information in the forms so thats something to boost your
          confidence.<br>
          <br>
          37.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you skilled at photoshop? I see a
          lot of talented individuals on online forums that be photo
          shopping images like crazy. You can seriously turn this skill
          into a business by start offering photo shopping services to
          web masters or individuals that are looking for such work.<br>
          <br>
          38.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If you can photoshop then try selling
          your images on eBay because you never know, some people could
          very well purchase it. You never know if your images will
          become the next Internet phenomenon. <br>
          <br>
          39.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you knowledgeable in anything? Come
          on, i know you are smart in something everybody is good at
          least one thing... even me :). Well, what you could do is
          offer a inexpensive tutorial that teaches an individual how to
          learn the particular subject in an easy to follow manner.<br>
          <br>
          40.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you do screen printing for t shirts?
          Well, you are most likely an alternative to an online service
          [http://www.cafepress.com]http://www.cafepress.com. You can
          upload images of t shirts or what type of works you do at
          photo sharing services such as www.flickr.com. <br>
          <br>
          41.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Are you good at audio? You can get paid
          money to turn written text into audio or to turn audio into
          text (transcription). <br>
          <br>
          42.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you speak more then one language?
          Some companies or web masters may want text translated into
          more then one language.<br>
          <br>
          43.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Like software and scripts? Can you
          install these things? Webmasters who are not as technical may
          need your help, look around on freelance services to see who
          you can cater to.<br>
          <br>
          44.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is to those who are always anxious
          to get money fast online. This is about the quickest way that
          i know to make money online. First, you join affiliate
          programs, and second you send traffic to your affiliate link
          through Google adwords. However, this takes some prior
          experience to master, such as being able to pick the
          appropriate keywords.<br>
          <br>
          45.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you code software? If so then you
          should code a software that will fix a much needed problem,
          there are many software coders selling their inventions online
          for good money.<br>
          <br>
          46.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Offer online tutoring. There are always
          people looking to learn something new and the Internet makes
          it not only easier for you to do so but also effective. Never
          before have there been such an easier way to communicate with
          individuals live from all the way across the globe. By having
          your own website on your own server, you will help make
          yourself stand out from the majority of your competition.<br>
          <br>
          47.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Like sports? Make a sports site of some
          sort and monetize it with one of the methods that i mentioned
          earlier. Golf is a very expensive sport which makes this a
          good niche to tap into.<br>
          <br>
          48.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Start a website that relies 100% on
          backends. This is an easy way to make money and to also get
          individuals to sign up to your website. Just look at ebay, and
          paypal. Both websites are FREE to join and sign up but there
          are many hidden fees. It costs every time you receive money
          through paypal, and it costs every time you sell something on
          ebay, it relies 100% on backend sells a nice and effective
          business structure.<br>
          <br>
          49.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try network marketing. One of the
          fastest ways that an individual can grow their business is by
          leveraging the resources of others and a lot of beginning
          online business owners are always looking for other web
          masters to partner with. If you can help broker or bring
          webmasters together, then this may be a profitable business
          for you in the end. You could charge money for each connection
          that is made.<br>
          <br>
          50.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Online dating is a popular niche and
          there are many affiliate programs that pay you for each lead
          that you give them which can be some easy money if you know a
          lot of people. Or, if you have a unique idea you can go about
          forming your own dating site. <br>
          <br>
          51.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Form a network that will connect people.
          Whether its to connect old high school friends, old college
          friends, long lost friends, singles looking for dates, or
          people looking to share anything. These types of sites usually
          do very well and usually grow fast because of the built in
          viral mechanisms in them. Just look at youtube, worth over 1
          billion dollars and is no more then two years old. It makes it
          easy for people to share things with their friends... the
          powerful aspect of viral marketing. <br>

          In conclusion of this article 51 surefire ways to make money
          online, i wanted to show people who are new to internet
          marketing or who are interested in making money online that
          there are ways (and lots of them) to make money online.<br>
          <br>
          The options are limitless so you just need to find out what
          you think will be the most suitable way for you because
          everyone has different interests A couple of suggestions, i
          would recommend concentrating on a couple of these ways to
          make money... there are but so many hours in a day and the
          more rabbits you try to chase the less you may actually catch.
          Also, some tips that i mentioned are for building up short
          term money, short term money is like quick cash. <br>
          <br>
          You need it to get money so that you can reinvest in your
          business, but its nothing to build an online business on. So,
          what i recommend is try experimenting with some of these
          techniques and once you start making small money thats GOLD!
          You already done the first step you just need to keep testing
          and tweaking your experiments until you can maximize the most
          profit out of it and always go with building businesses as
          opposed to keep getting quick money... a business is much more
          profitable and reliable. Take care and hope you enjoyed.<br>
