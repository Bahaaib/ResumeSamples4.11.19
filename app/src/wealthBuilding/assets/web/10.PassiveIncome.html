          Are you working a dead end 9 to 5 job? Are you working way too
          much and getting paid way too little? Do you spend your
          weekends fretting over what lies ahead of you on Monday
          morning? Does your job exhaust you mentally and physically?<br>
          <br>
          Wouldn’t it be nice to live the life you deserve and wake up
          each morning, leisurely read the newspaper over a delicious
          breakfast. Afterwards, you plan the day’s fun activities and
          not worry about having a clock to punch or even a boss you
          would like to punch? Wouldn’t you like to do what you want
          each day knowing your bank account is not sitting idle but it
          is being rewarded passively each and everyday whether you work
          or not?<br>
          <br>
          If so, read further.<br>
          <br>
          In order for you to enjoy this type of lifestyle, you need to
          implement the power of passive income. Passive income is a way
          of creating a revenue stream with very little effort on your
          part. In a nutshell it is earning more especially on a
          consistent basis while you work less. Sounds good doesn’t it?<br>
          <br>
          Following are several ways for you to create such passive
          income. Once you implement either one or all of these methods,
          be prepared to pull in passive income day after day.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Website</b> – by establishing your own website, you can
          create passive income. Set up a website with a focus on a site
          that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye as well as offers
          the website visitor valuable content. Create your website with
          a niche market you want to put an emphasis on. Invest your
          knowledge into this niche. The result is you will easily be
          able to move forward with ways to turn it into a passive
          income generator.<br>
          <br>
          Once you start receiving a steady flow of visitors to your
          site, you can move for a membership site. Visitors will be
          willing to pay the membership fee you charge to glean the
          expertise and knowledge you provide.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Affiliate Programs</b> – By selling other people’s
          products, you can generate passive income by earning a
          commission. Find products that share the theme of your
          website. Selling these products on your website creates the
          ideal situation for you to earn passively. You do not have to
          inventory anything, the affiliate company will handle that.
          All you have to do is promote the product(s) and earn a
          commission every time a sale is made.<br>
          <br>
          Sending out emails with the affiliate links of the products
          you sell is another great passive income generator. Just write
          a good email to everyone you know that may benefit from the
          product. If someone is interested, clicks the link and then
          buys, guess what? You have got an affiliate commission check
          coming your way at the end of the month.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Advertisements</b> – Generate passive income via
          advertisements. If your website is getting tons of visitors
          every day having banners and ads posted to your site for a fee
          would be beneficial. Once the ad and banner are established,
          you should get a monthly payment.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Your Own Products</b> – Passive income can be generated
          by creating and selling your own products. If you have some
          valuable knowledge about something or some unique talent,
          gather that knowledge and craft it into an ebook and offer it
          for sale. There is no reason to hold on to that knowledge when
          there is an audience out there dying to gain your knowledge.
          Share it and profit from it.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>5. Search Engine Revenue</b> - Hosting a search box on
          your website provides another passive income stream. The best
          scenario for this is for your website to receive countless
          visitors per day. It is as easy as finding a search engine
          that would pay to have their search boxes posted on your
          website. Then when a visitor to your site does a search via
          that search box, you get a payment.<br>
          <br>
          Implementing these strategies for passive income will not cost
          you no more than just a few dollars. The only real cost is the
          initial time and effort you put in to establish your
          foundation.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have started the passive income machine flowing, over
          time you will start to see some very positive results in your
          bank account. After that the life you deserve is well within
          your reach and you will be earning money with less work on
          your part. Just make sure that you research things carefully
          and do your due diligence about any money making ventures that
          you intend to try,<br>
