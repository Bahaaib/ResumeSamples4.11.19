          When the internet first started, few could ever imagine how
          far reaching it’s effects will be more than a decade down the
          line. It’s a fact of life now that the internet will continue
          to change virtually every aspect of our everyday life. As the
          world’s internet population keeps expanding, so does the
          opportunities for entrepreneurs and ordinary folk looking to
          escape the slavery of a nine to five job.<br>
          <br>
          Online wealth building is for everyone. The sheer amount of
          opportunities presented online enables anybody to start
          building wealth online. There are just so many areas to
          explore and regardless of your level of talent, skill or
          interest, you will find something that suits you. Someone once
          said that ‘you can turn any passion into profit online’ and
          this is more true now than ever before. It seems like the
          biggest problem is not in finding a suitable program, but
          rather in not getting distracted by all the various options
          that we get bombarded with. Every single day new opportunities
          open up and it’s our natural tendency to get in on the action.
          Online wealth building however relies on focus and having the
          discipline to not get distracted.<br>
          <br>
          If you are committed to building your wealth online it holds
          many obvious advantages. The freedom to work on your own clock
          and answering only to yourself are the main reasons why so
          many make the shift from the office to the spare room at home.
          Many online wealth building programs create false illusions
          that leave many aspiring newbies out in the cold after
          investing their valuable time and money. The internet is a
          tough world when it comes to making a living, but then again
          so is it out there in the ‘real’ world. Don’t expect an easy
          ride, but don’t be put off either. There are just so many
          opportunities online that you are bound to find your place
          sooner rather than later.<br>
          <br>
          I would like to offer you what I consider to be the five laws
          of online wealth building, that can help you greatly towards
          creating long term success online. I would encourage you to
          use these laws to evaluate potential opportunities or just to
          evaluate your current position.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Law Of Excellence:</b><br>
          <br>
          Things tend to move really fast online. It is critical that
          you commit yourself to excellence and to always keep learning
          and improving. If you don’t you will most certainly fall
          behind. Strive for excellence. You can’t keep doing the same
          things and expect to improve, nor does doing more of what
          doesn’t work won’t make it work any better.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Law Of Quality:</b><br>
          <br>
          I like the term ‘wealth building’ because it implies that it’s
          not some instantaneous thing. Quality always gets rewarded
          long term and although some of the ‘get rich quick’ schemes
          online work, they rarely work long term. There is a big
          difference between making a quick buck and building wealth.
          Whatever you create online, strive for quality first as this
          will ensure sustainability in what you do.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Law Of Choice:</b><br>
          <br>
          Wealth is a choice. You’ve probably heard this before, but
          never really understood it completely. Being wealthy starts
          with a choice and it’s a choice you have to make daily. The
          internet is responsible for the largest distribution on wealth
          in history. The power is shifting from the big corporations to
          the guy (or girl) in his garage with a single laptop. You can
          choose to be part of this or to keep doing what you’ve always
          done.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Law Of Persistence:</b><br>
          <br>
          When it comes to online wealth building, for some the learning
          curve will be greater than for others. Regardless of your
          skill level you will face many challenges and often consider
          packing it in. This is where persistence and perseverance
          comes in. Realize that you will always meet with much
          difficulty before you succeed – it’s essential for your
          personal growth and developing to a level of success.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>The Law Of Value:</b><br>
          <br>
          Whatever you do online, be a team player! I cannot
          overemphasize that enough. Your wealth and success is directly
          proportional to the amount of value that you add to other
          people. If you want to be more successful, just think of how
          you can add more value to other people’s lives.<br>
          <br>
          Financial success is most certainly obtainable for virtually
          anybody. There is however a big difference between obtainable
          success and sustainable success. Just think back at the story
          of The Three Little Pigs – you want to build your ‘house’ from
          brick and make sure that your success is sustainable long
          term. After all, who wants to quit their day job only to go
          back after six months?<br>
