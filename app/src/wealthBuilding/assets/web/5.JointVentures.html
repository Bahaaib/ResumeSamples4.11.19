          <br>
          Almost every one of today’s billionaires built their empires
          on a joint venture of some sort. In the past, joint ventures
          were built on mergers, friendships, networks, and alliances.
          The internet has introduced join venture companies which work
          to join web publishers with products they can sell.<br>
          <br>
          The fundamental principals behind joint ventures makes solid
          business sense. It is often cheaper to pay a content rich
          website a percentage of sales, or a fee for inbound traffic,
          in exchange for exposure.<br>
          <br>
          Content rich websites are hard to manage, expensive to build,
          and are usually out of date within months. Adding content
          weekly can cost $8 - $15 an article. Managing a 1000 page
          content rich site, including newsletter, forum, blogs, and
          community can be downright dehabilitating.<br>
          <br>
          That is why the web works to join content rich web sites with
          small businesses ventures. But, like everything, there is a
          right way to form a venture, and a wrong way.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Affiliate Programs</b><br>
          <br>
          One of the most popular is the affiliate programs run through
          Commission Junction, Click Bank, and Amazon’s fulfillment
          program. These let the web publisher choose the products they
          want to promote. In return, the small business receives a
          ‘pre-selling’ tool, and increased traffic.<br>
          <br>
          However, not all web publishers are equal. Many do not
          understand the finer points of pre-selling. They believe their
          only purpose is to create a ‘place holder’ on the web for the
          ad to appear on.<br>
          This makes it frustrating for the small business owner who
          pays for thousands of clicks but makes relatively few sales.<br>
          <br>
          Most businesses throw up their hands after a few months and
          cry, ‘Is there something better?’<br>
          The answer is a simple – Yes.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Joint Ventures</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          There are thousands of joint venture opportunities out there.
          There are probably less than a dozen legitimate ones. Most of
          them, priced way beyond what a work at home professional can
          afford.<br>
          <br>
          This forces work at home professionals to do things the ‘old
          fashion’ way. Take time to surf the web. If one or two
          websites offered a great ROI (Return On Investment) for your
          PPC (Pay Per Click) Campaign, then visit the website.<br>
          <br>
          If the website includes a forum, blogs, new content, mailing
          lists, then the small business person found a gold mine.
          Contact the web publisher and ask them if they would be
          interested in a Joint Venture.<br>
          <br>
          The odds are good that Google is not paying them something
          equivalent to what you are paying the PPC program. If Google
          is charging $.50 per click, and the monthly cost is $100.00
          then offer the publisher $50 - $100.<br>
          <br>
          In many cases, some of these publishers are happy to receive a
          guaranteed $20 a month.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Quality</b><br>
          <br>
          Freedom to surf the website and look for the best content
          management sites can dramatically increase their ROI.<br>
          <br>
          Some of the biggest content management sites have their own
          advertising fees. This can make life easier, but there are
          ways to offer publishers more value.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Add Value</b><br>
          <br>
          One way to add value is to ask the publisher whether there is
          anything you can sell for them. Many web publishers can easily
          whip up a book. Adding it to your ‘package’ can improve their
          desire to help you sell, and give them more links.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Success</b><br>
          <br>
          The success of a joint venture program is wrapped up in the
          contract. Make sure that you have a proper legal contract in
          place and that all parties truly understand how the operation
          will work, responsibilities, outcomes, and that there is a
          high degree of trust and good communication between everyone
          involved.<br>
