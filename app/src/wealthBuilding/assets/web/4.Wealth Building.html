          One of the shortcuts to creating wealth is to learn from those
          who have achieved great wealth.<br>
          <br>
          The late John Paul Getty is known as one of the greatest
          wealth builders in American history.&nbsp; He was kind enough
          to distill his wealth building rules for anyone who desires to
          amass wealth like him to follow.<br>
          <br>
          Do you want to be fabulously rich? Then learn from the master
          wealth creator himself, and follow in his footsteps:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Rule No. 1:</b><br>
          <br>
          To acquire wealth today, you must be in your own business.<br>
          You may think that the corporate executive with a $100,000
          salary is better off than small shop owner, but the executive
          will be hard-pressed to double his income and taxes will eat
          up most of any increase.<br>
          <br>
          The simplest peanut vendor has unlimited opportunity to expand
          his business and his income, and even salesmen, who in most
          cases are able to write their own paychecks, can control his
          sale increases himself.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Rule No. 2.</b><br>
          <br>
          You must have a working knowledge of the business when you
          start and continue to increase your knowledge of it as you go
          along.<br>
          <br>
          If you don't know what you're doing when you start, your
          mistakes will be costly and often unnecessary, and you won't
          be able to keep up with the technological explosions in any
          field. <br>
          <br>
          Start smart and stay that way.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Rule No. 3.</b><br>
          <br>
          You must save money in your personal life and in your business
          venture as well.<br>
          <br>
          Discipline is the key to saving money. You must develop the
          will power to deny yourself immediate gratification or the
          temptation to gamble on the quick buck. Resources will be
          needed for expansion and should be guarded carefully.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Rule No. 4.</b><br>
          <br>
          You must take risks, both with your own money or with borrowed
          money.<br>
          <br>
          Risk-taking is essential to business growth.<br>
          <br>
          Nelson Bunker Hunt is admired for his guts in trying to corner
          the silver market, not scorned for losing money on this
          deal.&nbsp; Some of the richest men have staked their entire
          fortunes and lost, several times over, before the risk-taking
          paid off.<br>
          Back those risks with good judgment, experience, commitment,
          and the right support.<br>
          <br>
          Seek advice on risks from the wealthy who still take risks,
          not friends who dare nothing more than a football bet.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Rule No. 5.</b><br>
          <br>
          You must not only learn to live with tension, you must seek it
          out.<br>
          Thrive on stress! If it means getting physically fit, having a
          psychiatric overall or losing 50 pounds before you can handle
          it, do it.<br>
          <br>
          Once you can learn to thrive on stress, you will not only
          enjoy it, you will seek it out willingly and enthusiastically
          and wonder how you could live any other way.<br>
          <br>
          Men of means look at making money as a game which they love to
          play.&nbsp; Consider it serious business and you will suffer
          far more stress than you need or want.<br>
          <br>
          Keep your perspective or your stress level will rocket beyond
          your control.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Rule No. 6.</b><br>
          <br>
          Build wealth as a by-product of your business success.<br>
          <br>
          If wealth is your only object in business, you will probably
          fail.<br>
          Wealth is only a benefit of the game. If you win, the money
          will be there. If you lose, and you will from time to time if
          you play long and hard enough, it must have been fun or it was
          not worth it.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Rule No. 7.</b><br>
          <br>
          Patience.<br>
          <br>
          This is the greatest business asset. Wait for the right time
          to make your moves.<br>
          <br>
          Let your business grow naturally, not by pressing your luck.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Rules No. 8.</b><br>
          <br>
          Diversify at the top.<br>
          <br>
          Once you've made it, you'll understand that any business is
          limited in the challenges it offers.&nbsp; You'll want and
          need other games to play, so you'll look for other ventures to
          hold your interest.<br>
          <br>
          May these words of wisdom from Mr. Getty inspire you to build
          fabulous wealth and reach the stars.<br>
