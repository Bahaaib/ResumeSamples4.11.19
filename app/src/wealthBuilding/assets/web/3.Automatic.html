          Can you really build wealth automatically?<br>
          <br>
          The answer is yes...you just need to acquire a new wealth
          building habit.<br>
          <br>
          You are going to love this habit because you do not even have
          to remember it....a banking computer remembers the habit for
          you! How is that possible? Read on and you will soon see.<br>
          <br>
          Here is how the automatic wealth building habit works. It is
          based on the miracle of compounding interest and the amazing
          banking technology that is available to virtually all of us
          today.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Step 1</b><br>
          <br>
          If you do not have a bank account with "Bill Pay" go to a bank
          that has it and open a new account. Ask them how many checks
          can be sent per month, can it be managed via the internet,
          what are the costs. Many banks now offer this service for free
          as a promotion to get more customers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 2</b><br>
          <br>
          Decide who it is that you want to help build wealth. Yourself,
          your child, a grandchild, or even a friend. This habit also
          works for building spiritual wealth...more on that later.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 3</b><br>
          <br>
          After you open the account you now have the ability to select
          any amount of money that you want sent to any person or
          organization and at almost any time interval. Some banks even
          offer an unlimited amount of bills that can be sent. The banks
          will then mail checks at regular intervals to the people or
          organizations you have designated...you do not have to do
          anything.<br>
          <br>
          The real power of this habit is that you are not going to be
          sending bills in most cases...you will be sending wealth
          building payments....automatically!<br>
          <br>
          OK, before we get to step 4 let's look at the amazing power of
          compounding interest to see how much wealth can be built over
          time with this habit.<br>
          <br>
          Here is an example of how much wealth you could build by
          having your billpay send just $50 per month into an account
          (mutual fund, IRA, etc) that has a 5% yield.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1 Year = $615</b><b><br>
          </b><b>5 Years = $3,400</b><b><br>
          </b><b>10 Years = $7,764</b><b><br>
          </b><b>25 years = $29,775</b><br>
          <br>
          You can learn more about compounding interest by doing a
          Google search on the internet. Obviously the amount of wealth
          you can build varies with the amounts and frequency of bill
          payments sent to your wealth building accounts and your rate
          of interest.<br>
          <br>
          This is where research can help you, it is beyond the scope of
          this article to show you all the amazing possibilities that
          exist.<br>
          <br>
          The beauty of the bill pay system is that it is very easy to
          adjust your recurring amounts up or down based on your current
          financial situation. As an example, you could set up your bill
          pay to send $12.50 each week into an account (Equals $50 per
          month) or change it to $15 per week for a few weeks and then
          back down to $12.50 at a later time. You decide exactly who
          gets the money, how much, and how often....you have complete
          control at all times. It is amazing wealth building power.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Step 4</b><br>
          <br>
          Now it is time to set up your automatic wealth building habit
          using your banks billpay system. Get the address of the person
          or organization you want the money sent to including the
          account number. Go online and set up a new account with this
          information. Set frequency and amounts. Note: I have been
          doing this since 1992 and have multiple accounts (Charities,
          IRA's etc) that have received money from me every month for 14
          years and I have never written or signed a single check! I
          know from personal experience that the system works and I have
          never had any problems.<br>
          <br>
          You can get very creative with how you build wealth and who
          you help build wealth.<br>
          <br>
          * Set up an automatic bill pay to fund a child’s college
          education. There are many states that have plans that start
          with low monthly fees when the child is born or still young.<br>
          <br>
          * Set up an automatic bill pay to fund a child’s savings
          account, just have the money be sent to the child’s bank with
          their account number listed on the check memo "Deposit to
          account ######"<br>
          <br>
          * Set up an automatic bill pay to send a charity a payment
          every week. Remember that I said earlier that this habit can
          help you build spiritual wealth? If your church receives an
          automatic charity payment every week you are helping to
          support your church every week, even when you miss a Sunday
          service.<br>
          <br>
          * Set up an automatic bill pay to send money to someone in
          need.<br>
          <br>
          * Set up your bill pay to actually pay bills that you have
          paid late in the past....you may be able to save enough in
          prevented late fees to fund your wealth building payments!<br>
          <br>
          The possibilities are endless.....you just need to take action
          and make it happen.<br>
