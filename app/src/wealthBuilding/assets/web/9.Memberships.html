          Membership web sites are great ways to make residual income.
          Selling information via password protected web sites is a big
          business, and it has a low barrier to entry, and minimal
          operating costs. Unfortunately, you aren't the first, or even
          the thousandth person to realize this. What do you do?<br>
          <br>
          While it's a hot business model, not every membership site
          will pull people in, and even the ones that do, some don't
          make a lot of money. There have been far more failures than
          success stories with membership sites, though part of that is
          simply keeping track of expectations. The single most common
          site crippling and business killing factor though, will
          surprise you. It's something so elementary that you'll smack
          your forehead and wonder why people make this mistake,
          repeatedly.<br>
          <br>
          It's failing to do the market research to ensure
          profitability.<br>
          <br>
          It's not rocket science. You need to sell what people are
          already inclined to buy. Don't reinvent the wheel. Don't do
          this for art's sake – it's commerce.<br>
          <br>
          Identify your target market. Sell them what they're already
          buying (and thus, already want). Listen to what else they want
          and expend your range of products and services to meet their
          demand.<br>
          <br>
          Admittedly, this was an amazing sea change in product launches
          back in the 1970s, but it's going on 40 years since the
          concept of market research to tune a product launch hit big
          business and trickled down to ubiquity. And yet, time and time
          again, internet squeeze sites keep selling what the owner
          thinks will sell, not what the market has told him will sell.<br>
          <br>
          The usual excuse is "Well, what am I offering that they can't
          get elsewhere, buying those products individually?"<br>
          <br>
          Knowing what people are already buying, you have the MUCH
          easier task of packaging those information products and
          bundling them together into one location; your time spent
          packaging and sorting is worth their money. Your willingness
          to be "eyes ahead" to look for new products in that niche is
          time they don't have to spend, and in this day and age, time
          is more precious than money. This applies if you're selling
          informational goods, physical goods, subscriptions to
          newsletters, or services. You have to package what people want
          so they'll buy them from you, not your competitors, and all
          you have to do is convince them that you add enough value by
          saving their time to be worth your monthly membership fee.<br>
          <br>
          Now, differentiation from the competition does take work; look
          into alternate formats like audio, video and ebooks. Give your
          consumers choices about how they get their information and how
          they use it. Offering audio and video formats pays for itself
          rapidly in increased memberships.<br>
          <br>
          Next, keep it fresh. Always be on the lookout for something
          new, something fresh. Focus on giving new, enticing offers to
          keep those membership fees coming in. And don't get
          complacent. We've seen well done membership sites; ones with
          good site design, great keyword placements, loaded with
          products people wanted to buy, easy to use, and customers
          signing up in droves…and all worthless three months later,
          because the site owner didn't capitalize on the momentum, and
          run to keep ahead of his customers.<br>
          <br>
          Your typical customer will buy things every four to six weeks;
          make sure you have something new for them to buy every two
          weeks or so. Basic rule of shopkeeping; always turn the
          products on the shelves, or in your case, the product on the
          web site.<br>
          <br>
          Lastly, solicit feedback from your customers. Work with them.
          Listen to what they have to say, and adjust course based on
          it. It's their money, they're just telling you why they want
          to give it to you. Do this every week or every month, and your
          paychecks will grow nicely.<br>
