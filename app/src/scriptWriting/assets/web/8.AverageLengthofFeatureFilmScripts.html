<span style="font-weight: bold;">Average Length of Feature Film Scripts</span><br>
<br>
If you are looking to create a feature film for any purpose, you are
probably wondering how to get started.&nbsp; The average filmmaker has
a process that they use to actually get started.&nbsp; The specific
process that each filmmaker uses is often quite different because
everyone chooses to approach their film differently.&nbsp; While many
filmmakers approach the process of creating feature film with the
simple idea that pops into their head there are many others who begin
the process of creating a film by starting with a script.&nbsp; The
length of the script that a filmmaker typically starts with is quite
varied in general, which leaves everyone a lot of options to explore
options available to them.<br>
<br>
Many filmmakers begin working on a feature film based off a tiny script
or even a small book.&nbsp; This can be something that is as short as
only 5-6 pages or as long as 100 pages easily.&nbsp; The exact length
of the script often varies based upon the length of the film itself and
many times the length is changed substantially as the filming process
starts to unfold.&nbsp; In general, a shorter script will translate
into a much shorter film.<br>
<br>
Another guideline that you can use to help you determine how long your
film script should be is to use the average idea that each page of
script will consist of approximately 30 seconds of footage.&nbsp; This
is only a rough estimate though; extensive lines of spoken script can
take longer to do while fewer lines will generally take less
time.&nbsp; This is important to keep in mind if you are working
towards filming a film that will be a specific amount of time when you
are finished.<br>
<br>
It is also very important to remember that everything shot for footage
will rarely actually be used.&nbsp; Most filmmakers will edit out
various parts, change the layout a bit and make additional changes to
the film, which can alter the length.&nbsp; Typically speaking if you
shoot 60 minutes of footage you can expect that to translate into only
a 30-45 minute feature film.&nbsp; If you find that you have additional
footage time you could choose to shorten the film further, or you could
be satisfied with the length that you have achieved.<br>
<br>
The major problem that many filmmakers experience when working with
scripts is trying to ensure that they are detailed enough to provide
enough footage.&nbsp; For example, if you are trying to create a
feature film that will be at a minimum 15 minutes you would need at
least a 30-page script to fill out the entire 15 minutes
allotted.&nbsp; In many cases you would need to further lengthen the
script as well so that once areas have been edited out you still have
the entire 15 minutes that you are striving for.<br>
<br>
If you are working with a writer or a team of writers, it is generally
much easier to handle the task of editing the script.&nbsp; As a
filmmaker, you would be responsible for reading over the script
initially and writing down any notes that you have.&nbsp; These notes
would allow the writers to expand the script in areas where you as the
filmmaker would like more information and details.<br>
<br>
If you are quite creative with fleshing out scripts at the last minute,
you may find that the actual length of the script you have is not
important.&nbsp; It is possible for many feature filmmakers to easily
take a very short script and turn it into a very extensive film.&nbsp;
This is not something that everyone is capable of, and frequently this
ability is fine tunes as experience is gathered.&nbsp; There are many
filmmakers who find that years after beginning a career in the film
business they are able to easily flesh out scripts at the last minute,
but the main ingredient to success is starting with a script that has
plenty of detail and creativity to it so that you can easily grasp the
entire breadth of the film and enjoy the creation process.<br>
