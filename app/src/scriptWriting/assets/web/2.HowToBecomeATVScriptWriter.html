Script Writer</span><br>
<small><small>By Mark Hempshell</small></small></p>
<p>Have you ever watched an episode of Eastenders, Coronation Street,
Casualty, Spooks, Hollyoaks or even an old classic like The Good Life
and thought.... I could do something like that?</p>
<p>I have to be honest, writing for TV probably isn't the easiest way
of making money from writing.... but there are a lot more opportunities
than you might think. I know for a fact that TV is absolutely desperate
for talented new writers with original ideas. It seems like a lot of
fun too.</p>
<p><strong>The rewards from writing for TV can be excellent.</strong>
All from just coming up with a good idea. Did you know that even fairly
average TV scriptwriters can earn anything from &pound;5,000
to&pound;15,000.... for writing just one single episode of a TV drama
or soap?</p>
<p>I think you can see that at those sort of rates you wouldn't need to
write that many scripts in a year to make a very lucrative full time
income from writing.</p>
<p>So this week I thought it would be a good idea to look at how you
could get into TV scriptwriting:</p>
<p>* You can come up with your own idea for a TV programme or write for
an existing one. It's probably easier to start by writing for an
existing one. Popular TV programmes often have teams of dozens of
writers writing for them.</p>
<p>TV is a mass market media so your idea needs to be fairly mass
market. So look at ever-popular, mass-market topics to write on. For
example: Crime. Mystery. Comedy. Popular history. Sci-fi.... there's a
reason Doctor Who has lasted so long. Real life stories. Romance. Look
for modern twists on these new ideas.</p>
<p>It's not just fiction either. You can write a documentary or
investigation. Or write some kind of factual programme.... such as
cookery, gardening, travel or a children's TV programme.</p>
<p>* Take some time to study the craft of scriptwriting. Look for any
short courses your local writers' groups might offer. Or read some
books on the subject - you can find a selection of scriptwriting books
on Amazon.</p>
<p>* You'll need an example of your work to get started. This is known
as a 'calling card' or 'shop window' script. Don't write an entire
series of programmes. A script for 10-20 minutes of your programme idea
would probably be enough.</p>
<p>Your script must be: Well structured, have a good plot and strong
characters. Keep it fairly simple - say a conversation between 2/3/4
characters in the pub. (Tip. Don't write a script that needs a massive
cast list or an exotic location. Thinking of the cost puts buyers off
before you've started!)</p>
<p>Your script needs to be written in dialogue.</p>
<p>* Next you need to market your script. The person you need to get in
touch with is the Script Editor for the TV programme or TV company you
want to write for. Script Editors are responsible for commissioning
writers.</p>
<p>It's a long shot.... but it's worth a try. Try phoning and asking to
speak to the Script Editor. Ask if they'd be interested in reading your
sample script. Assuming you don't get to speak to them (which is most
likely) send a letter outlining your idea. Don't send them your sample
script unless they say they are interested.</p>
<p>There are several places you can try to sell your TV writing. Here
are a few ideas:</p>
<p>* The BBC. The BBC is not only one of the biggest buyers of TV
writing but most open to new writing talent. So OK, they're going to
have a very stretched budget over the next few years but that's
actually good news for new writers not bad news. As successful writers
get poached by commercial companies they're going to need lots of new
writers to replace them.</p>
<p>Most new opportunities to write for the BBC are handled through
their centralised service called Writersroom: <a target="_new"

<p>* ITV. The ITV Network is made up of 15 regional licences, 11 of the
licences in England and Wales are owned by ITV Plc. You'll need to find
the right department to send your idea to - have a look on their
website. This is probably not the easiest way to get started though.</p>
<p>* Independent production companies. These are private companies who
make TV programmes for the BBC, ITV and other TV stations.... all
Channel 4 programmes are made by independent production companies for
example. They're a pretty good bet for new writers, although you'll
probably be expected to do some work on your idea and only get paid for
it if they can still it to a TV channel.</p>
<p>Most independent production companies specialise in one or a small
number of subjects so you'll need to find those who are most likely to
be interested in your type of idea. The trade association PACT has an
online directory of members. Or better still just watch lots of TV and
note down the name of the production company at the end!</p>
