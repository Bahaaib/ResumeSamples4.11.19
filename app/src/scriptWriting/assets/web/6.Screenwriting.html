<span style="font-weight: bold;">Screenwriting</span><br>
<br>
Screenwriting involves writing the materials for movies, plays, games,
and more. Some people are part of a writing team for a company. They
write for a sit com, daytime soap opera, or a drama that you see on TV.
Other people write them for movies on the big screen. It can be risky
to be a freelancer in the world of screenwriting. It can take months
and even years to complete a script. You then have to hope the right
people will take a look at it and want to use it.<br>
<br>
There are thousands of screenplays that get submitted each year to
agents. However, only a handful of them are chosen to be made into
something you will see. A screenwriter may change jobs several times in
their career in order to take advantage of various opportunities that
come their way. They need to know how to budget the money they earn too
because they never know when that next paycheck will be coming in.<br>
<br>
For those that have been lucky enough to have their talents recognized,
their work is in great demand. Many directors will take the time to
read a screen play just because of the name of the person that has
written it. Sometimes it takes that one lucky break though to get your
work into the right hands.<br>
<br>
Generally, the original screen play isn&rsquo;t accepted in its
original form. They director may only want it if they can make some
changes to it. This is to help get the overall results from the work
that they want. It can take years from a script to go from the hands of
the producer into full production. There is a great deal of rewriting
that goes on behind the scenes. There is also plenty of work to line up
the actors for the film.<br>
<br>
Other types of screenwriting have to be done very quickly and
consistently. These are for regular shows that are on TV. They can be
the hour long dramas we watch on certain nights or the thirty minute
sit coms that are so popular out there. These types of screenwriting
jobs do pay well but they can also be stressful.<br>
