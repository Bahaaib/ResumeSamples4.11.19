<small><small>By Magdalena Olchawska</small></small></p>
<p>This is how I write my scripts so I believe that everyone has to
find his own way of working that suits his/her the most.</p>
<p>I don't follow any rules of script writing when it comes to telling
the story, such as: at this point in a script that ought to happen. I
don't believe in this but many do and maybe that is why so many bad
scripts are coming out of Hollywood.</p>
<p>I do follow rules when it comes to the structure since it's just
easier for the entire crew and cast to follow the script and that is
clearer to read. It also looks much more professional when you get the
structure right and you want to look professional in front of your cast
and crew.</p>
<p>I usually start with writing an idea for a script, which is just a
simple description of the whole story. When this is ready, I move on to
working on the main characters. Of course it doesn't mean that I am
going to stick to the description I have already done. To me it just
works as more of a guideline.
<br>
After that I sit down and start coming up with the scenes, which at
first are just descriptions of what might happen in the scene.</p>
<p>When the skeleton of the script is ready I work from that point
re-writing the script, each time around making it better and fuller by
adding or taking away certain actions, dialogues or scenes.</p>
<p>In the finished script I try to describe the scenes as little as
possible, extra words are really not necessary and often confusing for
the actors. I usually try to work on dialogues and the overall
atmosphere of the story.</p>
<p>I know that there are many rules when it comes to writing different
genres, which for some people are good and they need to have it to be
able to write anything. Find a system that suits you best and stick to
it.</p>
<p>The more scripts you write, the better you become. Even if the
scripts don't turn up to be a movie this is the experience that is
vital for you.</p>
<p>I know that writing can be hard but once you start, it gets easier
and easier every time. The beginning point is the most important, after
that it's all just discipline. From my experience I can tell you that
writing for longer than five hours a day is difficult, this is a
creative work so it has to flow.</p>
<p>If you don't feel confident enough to write your scrip yet, take a
script writing workshops; some of them are really good. Try looking for
the workshops in your area online.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware there are quite a few websites that deal with
script writing/workshops online. However I don't know how secure that
kind of work is. You know, copyrights in writing and filmmaking are
huge issues so always remember to be covered on that subject.</p>
<p>Remember, find whatever suits you the most and copyright all your
work. There are many people willing to steal others ideas.</p>
<p>Notes on script writing</p>
<p>Below is the list of my notes on script writing based on some of the
workshops I've done in the past. You might find it useful:</p>
<p>1. Dramatic - sequence leading to change; strong moral element; one
character influences the other one.
<br>
2. Moral vision.
<br>
3. What is the moral line of the story?
<br>
4. What defines the storyline?
<br>
5. What is the moral change in the character?
<br>
6. PLOT - what the main character does in the story; fundamental change
in action. Character is defined through the plot.
<br>
7. Dialogue is seen as the quickest window to the character. The
dialogue expresses the volume of the character.
<br>
8. Drama - it is a conflict between what the character stands for and
the world surrounding the character.
<br>
9. Structure - is a development of the character.
<br>
10. The hero never knows what he wants and needs at the beginning of
the film.
<br>
11. To grow and develop the hero has to fight opponents and obstacles
on his way. To make the script more interesting, get into the deepest
level of conflict.
<br>
12. Whatever the hero comes up with at the start of the film it almost
never works out. So he has to adjust to changing circumstances.
<br>
13. Before the hero can change, he/she has to figure out what he/she
wants or is running away from, why he/she is holding back from taking
an action.
<br>
14. In the script it's also important to introduce the hero's internal
life, his/her natural space.
<br>
15. The hero before facing his/her fear or opponent will usually have
to go through some kind of change to become stronger.
<br>
16. People who have been in filmmaking longer than me say that for the
middle of the structure the stories obsessive desire is needed. The
character will do almost anything to get what she/he wants.
<br>
17. You have probably noticed that almost every film has a point when
the hero is just about to lose. It is called the lower point.
<br>
18. To make the story more powerful usually the hero learns something
from the opponent and grows.
<br>
19. If you want to reveal something, make a decision and change an
action. This way you give new information to the audience.
<br>
20. The hero needs to desire something in each scene.</p>
<p>Story structures</p>
<p>They say that there are only three basic story structures:</p>
<p>* Myth
<br>
* Fairy tale
<br>
* Drama</p>
<p>By taking bits and pieces from each structure and using it in a
different way, other stories emerge.</p>
