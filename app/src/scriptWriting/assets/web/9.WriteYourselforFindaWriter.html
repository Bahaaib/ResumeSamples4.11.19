<span style="font-weight: bold;">Write Yourself or Find a Writer</span>?<br>
<br>
Looking at all of the options for your script it is really easy to
become thoroughly confused when you are working on a script.&nbsp;
Trying to ensure that the script is laid out properly, all characters
are developed well and you do not miss any of the finer details is
enough to drive even the most sane director crazy.&nbsp; Struggling to
avoid all of these problems can create even more problems, especially
as you are trying to decide if a writer is what you need, or if you
should attempt to work out the script yourself.<br>
<br>
It is a good idea for all filmmakers to work on their own scripts at
some point.&nbsp; While this is not a skill that has to be thoroughly
developed, it can be a very useful skill that many directors
cherish.&nbsp; Having the ability to quickly modify a script themselves
is something that can save time, but will also allow for the temptation
to continuously play with the script as well.&nbsp; For filmmakers who
have a good working background with writing you may find that working
on the script yourself is best.&nbsp; This is not always the case
though; many filmmakers have found that working on the script
themselves is a problem.<br>
<br>
Some of the problems that can occur if you are working on the script
entirely yourself include a lack of time.&nbsp; When you are working to
prepare for a feature film there are a large number of things that need
to be done.&nbsp; Working out costumes, locations, equipment and even
possibly working on a budget are all hassles that must be
handled.&nbsp; Hiring a writer to handle these problems for you can
free up your time as a filmmaker to work on what you enjoy, and leave
the details of writing and laying out the script for someone else.<br>
<br>
Additionally you need to consider your budget, if you have a very small
budget, or something that is closer to nothing than a budget at all you
may find that it is necessary to write the script yourself just because
you cannot afford a writer.&nbsp; You still have a few options if you
find yourself in this position though.&nbsp; It is important to take
your time when writing the script if you need, but instead of just
diving into the script you could feel free to look around for someone
who is willing to write for you in order to gain experience.<br>
<br>
Finding a writer willing to work for just experience will not last for
long, and often you will need to agree to pay a percentage of any money
that the film makes, but it certainly beats paying a large premium for
a writer upfront.&nbsp; Additionally, using a writer who is willing to
work for a very cheap rate can allow you to build a great working
relationship with someone else who is just starting out.&nbsp; These
contacts can serve you well in your entire film career and should
always be encouraged if at all possible.<br>
<br>
Regardless of your ultimate decision over whether hiring a writer or
just writing the script yourself, ensure that you really make sure it
is developed properly.&nbsp; Rushing through a script, even if you are
paying for it can cause a lot of problems because you will have great
difficulty getting the high quality that you need to produce a high
quality film.&nbsp; Never cut corners on the script since this will be
one of the lifeblood&rsquo;s of your movie.<br>
