<span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn How To Write A Screenplay That
Actually Gets Made!</span><br>
<br>
Almost everyone thinks they know how to write a screenplay. We&rsquo;ve
all heard someone watching TV saying &ldquo;I could write a better
script than that&rdquo;!<br>
<br>
The truth is that just about everyone does have a story worth telling.
Unfortunately most do NOT know how to write a screenplay.<br>
<br>
Most professional artists are very particular about their tools. The
screenplay writer is no different. The key to writing is being
organized. Before even writing a single word, you must have an inner
road map that your characters are going to follow.<br>
<br>
If you are writing a novel, you CAN take the time to ramble and develop
your descriptive talents. A screenwriter cannot!<br>
<br>
Just like any muscle, the writing &lsquo;muscle&rsquo; has to be
exercised on a regular basis. The simple process of sitting in front of
a computer for set periods of time is critical in training the
subconscious that THIS time is when you are going to call on your
creativity. In order to learn how to write a screenplay you have to
understand STRUCTURE. Unlike a novelist, you do not have the luxury of
allowing your script to develop into 300 plus pages. It will not get
read if it does not conform to an industry standard of around 110 pages.<br>
<br>
The structure of most contemporary screenplays: 1) Establish the
character and general situation, 2) force them up a tree and throw
rocks at him and 3) get the hero down again.<br>
<br>
Firstly: you get the audience to know something about the character and
his situation.<br>
<br>
Secondly: a situation must be created that goes against your characters
comfort zone. He must have a nemesis trying to destroy everything he
stands for. This &lsquo;bad&rsquo; guy takes pleasure putting your hero
up that tree and making it as uncomfortable as possible.<br>
<br>
Thirdly: our hero needs to overcome all odds and &lsquo;payoff&rsquo;
the bad guy.<br>
<br>
If it really is that simple, then why isn&rsquo;t everyone a
screenwriter? The answer is they do not know how to write a screenplay.<br>
<br>
So let us say that you have a clear idea of what your three acts are
going to be. Well now you begin to develop the characters. They have to
play off each other and either support or destroy our main character.
Any time the characters are neutral, the screenplay is dead. Just
remember: conflict equals drama. No conflict, no drama.<br>
<br>
So what does it take to become a screenwriter, besides learning how to
write a screenplay? It takes discipline &ndash; to sit at your
workplace, even when you are not sure what you are going to write. It
takes having a thick skin, so that when the inevitable rejections come,
you do not BELIEVE in their judgment as to your potential. It takes
major BELIEF in yourself. But MOST of all it takes LUCK!<br>
<br>
The film industry is littered with great scripts that never got made. -
Directors fall out with producers. A great idea yesterday turns into a
pariah today. The studio that WAS going to make your picture has
changed hands and the new studio head wants to stamp his own
directorial policy on his new position &ndash; and you were chosen by
the previous head! There are a million legitimate reasons why Hollywood
should not immediately fall at your feet &ndash; but YOU are going to
overcome this. If you do not believe this, then do not even attempt to
learn how to write a screenplay! If you DO believe in yourself, then
hey &ndash; why shouldn&rsquo;t you be the one that gets lucky?!<br>
<br>
So yes, learning how to write a screenplay isn&rsquo;t so difficult.
The difficult part comes AFTER you have written the screenplay.<br>
