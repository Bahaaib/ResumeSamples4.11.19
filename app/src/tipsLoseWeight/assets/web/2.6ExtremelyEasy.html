          It doesn't have to be difficult to shed those unwanted pounds;
          you can lose weight. I'm sure you hate the word diet; just
          thinking about that word probably makes you want to avoid the
          process all together, right? There are some very effective
          ways in which you can lose weight effectively. So lets take a
          look at what it is that you can do to lose weight quickly.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Don't make yourself go hungry.</b> The trick to losing
          weight is to avoid diets altogether. Yes, it is odd sounding,
          but it's also very true. Actually, although it's unperceptive,
          many people cannot lose weight simply because they do not eat
          enough food throughout their day. You might feel pleased to
          see that you are shedding that extra fat on your thighs and
          stomach by going without food. If this is the case, then you
          must be unaware of the fact that these pounds will start
          piling back on very quickly. Why? Inadequate food intake will
          result in an intolerable lack of fuel for the body.
          Eventually, your body will figure out that it is not getting
          enough energy for survival. Your body will feel threatened and
          will gain weight as a defense mechanism. Humans' bodies have
          evolved to protect us as much as possible and our bodies fight
          our own selves to keep us living. The first thing that people
          think when they want to lose weight is that they have to
          consume much fewer calories. However, this actually causes the
          exact opposite of the purpose. I recommended your daily
          calorie intake be reduced by no more than 500 calories.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Eating more often throughout your day.</b> Make sure
          that the portions are much smaller has been proven to increase
          your metabolism, use more calories and will make you feel more
          energetic. It is preferable to eat five or six smaller meals
          throughout the day rather than the traditional three square
          meals. Following this practice will help maintain a high
          metabolic rate during the entire day. Consuming small frequent
          meals can satisfy your appetite while suppressing over-
          indulgence. Plan on eating something every three hours.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Your most important task in the morning is to eat a
            healthy, nutritious breakfast.</b> More than likely, when
          you wake up the morning it will have been at least 12 hours
          since your last meal, which means that by that time, you're
          body is running low on energy. You need to eat more when your
          body demands it. Breakfast should be your biggest meal, and
          your smallest meal should be your dinner. This is completely
          opposite of the average meal plan experienced by most people -
          a skimpy breakfast, big lunch and a large dinner. But think
          about it - your body will use all of the energy from a large
          breakfast, and the fat will not be stored, as you have fasted
          all night long. However, since your metabolism slows when you
          sleep and nighttime activities consume fewer calories, an
          overindulgent dinner is likely to go straight to your hips. It
          is more probable that you will store extra carbohydrates as
          fat when you are fuller after a day of eating.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Stay hydrated</b> - most people fail to drink enough
          water in the course of a day. Adequate water in your body is
          needed to burn fat and to keep cells healthy and hydrated.
          Have you ever woken up in the morning feeling so out of it
          that you'd almost think you were hung over? Dehydration is
          most likely the cause. Symptoms of dehydration are headaches,
          tiredness and fatigue. Your body's most plentiful nutrient is
          water. It contains about 60% - 70% water and your body depends
          on it for every task it performs in some way. Without water,
          your body cannot work and it will die.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Try not to eat a lot of sugar.</b> Foods with high sugar
          content are processed very fast, providing you with a large
          energy lift, which lasts only a short time. Consuming too many
          sugary foods will results in a sharp peak in your blood sugar
          followed by an abrupt rise in your insulin levels. Insulin
          quickly removes sugar from your blood, which in turn causes
          your blood sugar to drop below normal. When the sugar levels
          drop quickly, this causes loss of energy and also causes
          hunger and cravings for more sugary foods You will eat more
          sweets to quench your hunger, resulting in an on-going repeat
          of the energy peak and energy crash cycle. Plan your meals
          around lots of fruits and vegetables, lean meat and protein
          rich foods, with a little bread, rice or pasta for that
          carbohydrate fix you call for. Of course, you can't go the
          rest of your life without any sugar, but sugary foods and
          drinks should only be eaten every so often. <br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Some easy ways to exercise</b> are to walk instead of
          taking the car if you're only going a short distance, to take
          the stairs instead of taking the elevator, or to go out for a
          jog, a bike ride, or to skate. If working out at the gym is
          not for you, use these activities and other chores around the
          house to give yourself a good workout. If you do this
          consistently, you will lose that excess weight without even
          noticing the work that you're doing with these simple
          activities. Burning fat through exercise is better for your
          metabolism than just eating less. This way will burn off
          calories without lowering your metabolic rate. The best way to
          burn fat is aerobic exercise. In fact, while exercising, fat
          will turn into fuel for your body. Make an effort to include a
          half hour or more of light exercise in your daily routine.<br>
          <br>
          To summarize, in order to lose weight quickly, you must reduce
          your daily caloric intake by no more than 500 calories, reduce
          your intake of sugar, eat smaller meals more often throughout
          the day, eat a balanced breakfast, drink lots of water, and
          exercise. Use these guidelines and you will achieve your ideal
          weight in a minimum amount of time.<br>
