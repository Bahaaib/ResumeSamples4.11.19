          Healthy eating starts with careful planning and organization.
          Since fresh produce has a very limited shelf life, regular
          grocery shopping is a must. Creating a menu for the week and
          writing out a shopping list will save you time and money;
          while helping you stick to healthy recipes. Local health food
          stores and farmer markets are very money-wise solutions. Plus,
          frequent visits will allow you expand your culinary horizons
          as well as mingle with other health-concerned people.<br>
          <br>
          Healthy eating means using fresh ingredients and gentle
          cooking methods without adding any artificial ingredients and
          fats. Healthy eating requires a lot of cooking, since take-out
          food often contains too many refined fats and artificial
          seasonings. However, with modern appliances you will discover
          that cooking is no longer an annoying chore reserved for
          special occasions, but an exciting part of everyday life.<br>
          <br>
          So which products should we buy when we actually decide to
          begin eating healthy food? Here’s what your weekly shopping
          list should include.<br>
          <br>
          Vegetables. All vegetables should be eaten young, when they
          are tender and not coarse. Vegetables are best bought from
          fresh food markets or seasonal, when they are sold in boxes or
          baskets. Supermarket vegetables are often genetically modified
          or have been picked green and ripened in boxes when traveling
          long distances. Sprouts and brightly colored vegetables
          contain the most vitamins and antioxidants.<br>
          <br>
          Fruits. Again, the trick is to buy seasonal fruit, since
          exotic fruits have often traveled long distances and ripened
          in their boxes, not on trees. Local, naturally ripened or,
          better yet, organic fruit are the best choice for the
          health-conscious cook.<br>
          <br>
          Herbs. Aromatic herbs and spices can be used fresh or dried.
          The best idea is to plant the aromatic herbs in pots on your
          window and use them fresh whenever you need them. To preserve
          flavor, you can buy spices whole and use them freshly ground.<br>
          <br>
          Cheese. Although cheese is quite rich in fats, cheese is a
          great source of vitamins and minerals. Buy only fresh cheeses
          in small quantities and try to eat them at once, since gourmet
          cheeses don’t have a lengthy shelf life.<br>
          <br>
          Eggs. Buy only organic or free-range eggs, and shake them
          before buying to ensure freshness.<br>
          <br>
          Fish and shellfish. The best way to buy fish is fresh and
          unfrozen. Again, most of the fish in supermarkets comes from
          fish farms where it is fed with artificial substances, and
          this fish cannot be used in healthy recipes. Pink salmon and
          other popular kinds of fish will most likely come from a fish
          farm. Shellfish is a more healthy choice, since shrimp, for
          example, does not live in chemically polluted water. When you
          boil mussels, discard those that do not open.<br>
          <br>
          Meat. For truly healthy eating purposes it’s better to skip
          meat entirely, since it’s almost impossible to find meat that
          comes from an environmentally and health conscious farmer.
          Most of the meat in supermarkets has enormous quantities of
          growth hormones and antibiotics. The best meat for use in
          healthy recipes comes from small farming communities or
          organic farms.<br>
          <br>
          Grains. Whole wheat and whole grains should become a staple of
          your healthy eating routine, because many healthy ingredients
          are contained in the grain shell. Rice is the only exclusion
          from the rule, because, even though the rice grain shell is
          removed, many nutritional elements still remain in the rice
          grain.<br>
          <br>
          What we eat become a part of us. So make your kitchen a
          starting point for your new healthy eating habits, and enjoy
          preparing healthy meals.<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Have you ever heard the saying you are what you eat? In some
          sense, this is true, because if you eat unhealthy foods you
          are prone to be an unhealthy person. The foods we ingest are
          extremely important to our ability to grow, maintain function,
          and prevent illness. Therefore, if you value your health, you
          should learn as much about healthy eating as possible.<br>
          <br>
          Healthy eating is important from the day we are born. As a
          child, we grow quite rapidly and this is due in part to the
          foods we eat. Foods all contain nutrients that provide us not
          only with fuel to live our daily lives, but also with the very
          substances that build our bones, muscles, and organ tissues.
          Not getting enough of one nutrient or another can cause a
          variety of problems, including stunting our growth. For
          mothers who are nursing, nutrition is important because breast
          milk contains the nutrients a child needs to grow and develop
          properly. As we grow so does our need for more substantial
          solid foods, however our bodies need for proper nutrition
          never changes. Cells continuous break down and rebuild, so
          healthy eating for growth continues to be important right up
          until the day we die.<br>
          <br>
          Maintaining bodily functions is also important but without
          healthy eating in our daily lives, the energy we use to think,
          walk, talk, breathe, and perform any other action will suffer.
          The energy it takes our body to do these things comes from two
          places: fat reserves in the body from our daily food intake.
          If you don’t eat healthy foods, you will find that you are
          storing more fat that necessary or that you aren’t getting
          enough and you feel sluggish or weak. Along with
          energy-providing nutrients, like fats and carbohydrates, we
          also need the right nutrients to allow our organs to do their
          jobs. Hormones and other substances in the body make sure that
          everything is working properly. If you don’t eat the right
          nutrients, your body cannot produce these hormones and, as a
          result, cannot function properly.<br>
          <br>
          Lastly, healthy eating is important in order to prevent
          illness. When we don’t get the right nutrients, our bodies
          natural defense system against diseases weakens, allowing
          viruses and bacteria to attack the body. A good example is to
          consider our body like a well trained army, if the army
          doesn’t have enough to eat, it will not do well in battle.
          Without healthy meals and plenty of water, our bodies simply
          could not operate on a day-to-day basis. <br>
          <br>
          Understanding the different types of healthy food groups our
          bodies need on a day to day basis is vital and we should begin
          learning this as children. However it’s still not too late. If
          your eating habits aren’t what they should be definitely
          consider changing your diet, following a good exercise program
          and you will start feeling better for it.<br>
