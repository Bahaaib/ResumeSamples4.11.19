          Would you like to know how to make losing weight, no matter
          how many pounds, as simple as brushing your teeth? When you
          wake up in the morning or go to bed at night, do you dread
          having to brush your teeth? I know when I was a little kid, I
          hated to have to brush my teeth, but now it is not something I
          even think about. I just do it.<br>
          <br>
          Imagine if your weight loss and weight management could be
          just something you do naturally. Not something that stresses
          you out, gets you upset, and makes you complain, “Why are
          other people so lucky they don’t have to deal with this?”<br>
          <br>
          Let’s face it, “having to lose a couple of pounds” whether
          it’s a few of pounds or in the three digits, the process is
          not, “Yea, I won the lottery, what fun.” Having to lose weight
          can easily become an overwhelming event that bothers you all
          the time, crumbles your self confidence, is dangerous to your
          health, and if that wasn’t enough, it undermines your love
          life.<br>
          <br>
          So, back to when I was a little one and brushing my teeth. I
          hated to brush my teeth, but then something changed. It wasn’t
          until I gave up fighting against brushing my teeth and
          accepted that is a very important thing for me to do, that it
          all changed.<br>
          <br>
          Very shortly after that decision, brushing my teeth became a
          habit that I did in the morning and at night without even
          thinking about it. The action of brushing my teeth didn’t
          change, but my reaction to having to brush my teeth did and it
          made all the difference.<br>
          <br>
          So, how does this apply to losing weight? What if there are
          three actions you can take that once they are made into
          habits, your weight loss will become natural and you wouldn’t
          even have to think about? You will get to be the person that
          everyone else envies saying, “Why is it so easy for him/her to
          look so great?”<br>
          <br>
          Would it be worth it to accept these three new actions into
          your life and make them habits, if they will guarantee
          effortless weight loss that you don’t even have to think
          about?<br>
          <br>
          How about if those actions also provide outstanding health?<br>
          <br>
          I must warn you that there will be a level of discomfort in
          making these actions into habits, only because you are in the
          habit of not doing them. Normally, people mislabel this as
          hard, when in reality, it just feels different because it is
          new.<br>
          <br>
          But feeling different is a good thing. That means you are
          changing and opening the doors to your new life. Are you ready
          to find out what those actions are? They are not earth
          shattering, but you can not get around them and until you
          accept them and turn them into habits, you will end up
          fighting natural laws and struggling the rest of your life.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, those three actions are; consistent exercise, eating
          healthy, and reduction of stress. Simple? Yes, but stay with
          me here. Imagine if you did consistently take these three
          actions and they became habits. We are talking about taking
          the above actions without thinking and without feeling that
          you are getting deprived.<br>
          <br>
          It’s easy to say your weight loss would be effortless;
          however, the only real road blocks are turning those actions
          to habits. Unfortunately, we were not taught a systematic
          means to destroy old habits and build powerful new ones.<br>
          <br>
          I invite you to stop the struggle of fighting against the
          natural laws of the human body. One way or another, it will
          all come back to consistent exercise, eating healthy and
          reduction of stress, to achieve lasting results. Turn those
          simple actions into habits and you will end your weight loss
          struggles forever.<br>
