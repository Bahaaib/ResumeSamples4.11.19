          Dieting is not easy. If it were, we would probably all be
          thin. Since we are not, here are some tips that successful
          people use to lose weight so that others can benefit, too.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 1: Drink Plenty Of Water Each Day</b><br>
          <br>
          Okay, for many people this is a big problem. Water doesn’t
          taste all that great generally because water doesn’t really
          “taste” like anything. Drinking water 8 to 10 times each day
          gets easier the more you actually do it. It is simply a matter
          of conditioning your taste buds, and yourself, so that it
          becomes easier to do. Once you get started, you will begin to
          crave water.<br>
          <br>
          To begin with, you should drink a glass of water in the
          morning first thing, before you eat. This is probably the
          easiest glass you will drink all day and it will help you
          remember to drink water all day long. Better yet, why not
          drink two glasses?<br>
          <br>
          If you really cannot bear the taste of water, try using a
          water purifying pitcher or filter. You can also add a few
          drops of lemon or lime to your water – but no sugar or
          sweetener! Ice also helps.<br>
          <br>
          Check out flavored waters on the market, too. Just keep an eye
          out for additives.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Success Tip No. 2: Eat Breakfast</b><br>
          <br>
          Do not skip breakfast. If you need to go to bed a little
          earlier so that you can get up 20 minutes earlier each morning
          – do it! Breakfast is so important to your good health and to
          weight control. According to Dr. Barbara Rolls a professor of
          nutrition at Penn State University, "Your metabolism slows
          while you sleep, and it doesn't rev back up until you eat
          again."<br>
          <br>
          Eating breakfast is not only good for overall weight loss, it
          will help you stay on track with your diet the rest of the
          day. You are more likely to binge on something sweet and in
          the “bread” group if you skip breakfast.<br>
          <br>
          You can always keep a couple of hard-boiled eggs in the fridge
          or some high-fiber, low starch fruit around. If you plan to
          eat fruit at all during the day, breakfast is the perfect time
          to do it.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 3: Eat At Least 3 Meals And 2 Snacks Each
            Day</b><br>
          <br>
          This can be one of the hardest adjustments to make. After all,
          you are busy! You already have a “full-plate”. When do you
          have time to worry about filling your plate with more frequent
          meals?<br>
          <br>
          Just like eating breakfast will increase your metabolism, so
          will eating more often. This will also help you curb your
          bad-carb intake by making sure that your snacks are planned
          and occur regularly throughout the day.<br>
          <br>
          Really, it will just take a minimal investment of planning
          time at the grocery store and at home each morning before you
          head out for the day to make some healthy food choices and
          prepare a few healthy snacks and meals. For suggestions, just
          see the handy list of snacks and appetizers listed later.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 4: Avoid White Foods</b><br>
          <br>
          This is one easy way to remember what not to eat. If it is
          made from sugar, flour, potatoes, rice or corn - just say no.
          Remembering this rule of thumb will make it easier to
          recognize those rice cakes as an unhealthy high-carb snack.<br>
          <br>
          Always look for colorful fruits and veggies to substitute for
          the white ones. Buy broccoli, lettuce, bell peppers, green
          beans and peas, brown rice in moderation, leafy greens like
          kale and spinach, apples, melons, oranges and grapes.<br>
          These foods are not only colorful they are also high in fiber,
          nutrients and important antioxidants. Eating colorful fruits
          and vegetables will give your diet variety as well as give you
          added health benefits.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 5: Eat Your Veggies</b><br>
          <br>
          It is so easy to use a low-carb diet as an excuse for poor
          nutrition. Resist this temptation. If the only vegetable you
          have eaten in the last 5 years has been the potato, now is a
          good time to begin experimenting with other vegetables. This
          is important for your overall health and to avoid some nasty
          side effects of not getting enough fiber in your diet.<br>
          <br>
          If you try hard enough, you will find vegetables that you
          enjoy eating. Experiment with grilling veggies and cooking
          with real butter to add flavor. You can also search for new
          recipes on the Internet or in cookbooks.<br>
          <br>
          Remember, if you are only eating 40 grams of carb a day or
          less, two cups of plain salad greens contain only about 5
          grams of carbohydrate. You have no excuse not to eat your
          veggies.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 6: Prepare Your Own Food As Much As
            Possible</b><br>
          <br>
          While more and more restaurants are offering low-carb friendly
          menu items, many of them are still not ideal low-carb fare.
          There are many recipes for quick and easy meals that you can
          prepare yourself at home. Try to do this as often as possible.<br>
          <br>
          If you cook your own foods, you know exactly what the contents
          are and you will be able to better control for hidden sugar
          and otherwise processed foods.<br>
          <br>
          Another benefit is the cost savings over the long run. Even if
          you must go to the grocery store more often, you will save a
          significant amount per meal as opposed to eating at
          restaurants and fast food establishments.<br>
          <br>
          It will also be easier to maintain your diet with your own
          favorite fresh food selections on hand.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 7: Invest In A Good Set Of Food Storage
            Containers</b><br>
          <br>
          Having food storage containers of various sizes on hand will
          make it so much easier for you to plan your meals and snacks.
          When you buy nuts, fruits and vegetables in bulk you can
          simply prepare, separate and store them for easy use later.<br>
          <br>
          For instance, you can pre-slice your apples and snack on them
          over several days. Simply cut them, rinse them in pineapple or
          lemon juice and store. This will make a quick and easy snack
          for later.<br>
          <br>
          Fix your lunch and take it with you to work. Better yet, fix
          your lunch and 2 snacks for work.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 8: Drink A Glass Of Water After Each Snack</b><br>
          <br>
          This will help you get in your 8 to 10 glasses of water each
          day but it can also have other benefits. Ever feel hungry
          after eating a handful or standard serving of nuts? Try
          drinking water afterwards. The water will help you feel full
          and prevent overindulgence.<br>
          <br>
          Drinking water after a snack will also help remove the
          aftertaste from your mouth and can help curb your desire for
          more.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Success Tip No. 9: Eat Slowly &amp; Enjoy Your Food</b><br>
          <br>
          You will feel full and more satisfied if you take the time to
          savor your food and chew it slower. Don’t get in the habit of
          eating while standing or eating quickly. Sit down and chew.<br>
          <br>
          Eating slower will help you enjoy your food more, pay
          attention to what it is you are actually eating and get a
          better sense of when you are actually full.<br>

          </b><b>Success Tip No. 10: Plan Your Meals</b><br>
          <br>
          If you plan your week's meals in advance at the weekend then
          you can buy all the ingredients you need to make healthy and
          delicious meals.&nbsp; You can also make sure that you have
          plenty of variety of healthy snacks to keep you on track.<br>
