          Most fitness goals include weight loss, or the reduction of
          fat content, in one way or another. Whether we want to lose a
          couple pounds, change a clothing size, or gain muscle mass,
          loss and control of our fat content is usually part of the
          plan.<br>
          <br>
          Just as it is necessary to know what steps to take to meet
          your individual fitness goals, it is just as important to know
          what not to do. Avoid the following top ten mistakes that are
          sure to ruin your fitness efforts:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1. Fail to Plan.</b><br>
          <br>
          It's been said over and over: "If you fail to plan, you plan
          to fail." Working out without a pre-determined workout regime
          is similar to going on a trip without directions; most likely
          you'll end up getting lost. Don't make this common mistake.
          Enlist the aid of a qualified personal trainer to design a
          proper resistance training and aerobic program. Purchase one
          of the many guides to fitness programming and educate yourself
          on the basics.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>2. Compare yourself to others.</b><br>
          <br>
          Go into any gym and you're sure to see grunting exercisers
          muscling their way through workouts. Meanwhile, the group
          fitness studio is filled with twirling, panting, leaping
          students who look more like they're auditioning for a music
          video than participating in an aerobics class. Don't even
          think about trying to emulate them. At the very least you'll
          get discouraged that you can't keep up; at the worst you'll
          get hurt.<br>
          <br>
          Keep your expectations realistic. A beginning expecting to
          bench 300 pounds in the first month is doomed to failure.
          Better to increase strength incrementally over time. Likewise,
          presuming that you'll lose 100 pounds of bodyfat on a new diet
          in three months will never happen. Set realistic goals that
          will keep you motivated and concentrate on yourself, not
          others, throughout the process.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Too little exercise.</b><br>
          <br>
          Contrary to what popular exercise programs would have us
          believe, it is simply not enough to put in three or four
          exercise sessions per week and expect major results. Weight
          loss and body composition changes are results of cumulative
          lifestyle choices, not just exercise in the gym. There are 168
          hours in a week; expecting to lose weight by just spending 1%
          of our available time being active is ridiculous.<br>
          <br>
          This doesn’t mean you need to spend your entire day chained to
          a barbell, but make sure that you are active in some fashion
          every day. In addition to workouts, increase lower level
          activity by walking or bike riding to work, choose the parking
          space furthest away from the grocery store’s door, or get out
          and play with your kids. The point is to be active and keep
          the body in motion on a regular basis.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Too much exercise.</b><br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, don't become obsessed with exercise that it
          begins to rule your life. Over-training is as detrimental to
          achieving fitness goals as doing nothing at all.<br>
          <br>
          Common signs of over-training include overuse injuries,
          insomnia, fatigue, prolonged recovery from workouts, and
          general disinterest in exercise. Rest and recovery are vital
          for achieving gains and preventing burnout.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Never changing your workout routine.</b><br>
          <br>
          Nothing is as boring as the same routine over and over again.
          Not only will you get bored, your muscles will adapt and quit
          responding. Change your exercises, the order you do them, the
          number of sets and reps, and vary the weights. Variety is
          necessary or progress will stop. Make every workout different
          in some way.<br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Starving to lose weight.</b><br>
          <br>
          The usual American diet consists of a quick (usually missed)
          breakfast, lunch on the run and then a huge feast for dinner.
          Unfortunately, this is the worst eating plan for weight loss
          because it slows down the metabolism. When the body is not fed
          consistently, it flips into starvation mode developed through
          evolution and hangs onto fat content for survival.<br>
          <br>
          Research supports that the production of thyroid hormones can
          be negatively affected by repeated bouts of dieting and
          calorie restriction. Five or six smaller meals spaced evenly
          from 2.5 to 3 hours make it easier for the body to digest
          throughout the day and increase metabolism over the long term.
          It may sound counterintuitive, but in order to burn fat you
          need to eat. Instead of reducing the amount of meals, care
          should be taken in controlling portion sizes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>7. Underestimating alcohol consumption.</b><br>
          <br>
          Just as portion sizes need to be controlled, alcohol
          consumption must be limited, if not eliminated. Not only does
          alcohol have calories; it is actually metabolized more like
          fat than carbohydrates. Unlike fat or carbohydrates, alcohol
          has no nutritional value whatsoever. Drinking a glass of wine
          or having that martini may feel good but adds no benefit
          whatsoever to weight loss and muscle growth. The empty
          calories of those "liquid lunches" just add up too quick.<br>
          <br>
          <b>8. Relying on fast food.</b><br>
          <br>
          In the New York Times Bestseller Fast Food Nation: The Dark
          Side of the All-American Meal, Eric Schlosser gives a
          convincing interpretation of how the rise of the multi-billion
          dollar fast food industry correlates with what we now see to
          be epidemic obesity in the U.S. Instead of spending time
          planning and preparing meals, it is far easier to grab the
          burger/fry/shake combo or a deluxe pizza on the way home from
          work.<br>
          <br>
          The problem with regularly eating out is that despite how
          careful we may think we are, we truly don’t know the makeup of
          most of the food that is being served to us. Even with fast
          food stores attempting to offer "healthier" choices,
          preparation of mass-produced meals relies on use of less than
          optimum ingredients and typically laden in fat. <br>
          <br>
          The only way we can be sure of knowing what we are consuming
          is to prepare food ourselves. Consuming less processed food is
          not always the easiest thing to do if we’re used to it, but it
          is a major lifestyle choice that needs to be changed. Besides,
          is it just a coincidence that we call it "junk food"?<br>
          <br>
          <b>9. Avoiding of weight training.</b><br>
          <br>
          An important concern for weight loss is increasing the body’s
          metabolism so caloric expenditure is increased throughout the
          day. As stated above, one way to do this is to make sure that
          the appropriate number of meals is consumed. Another way is to
          increase the percentage of muscle mass. The more muscle we
          carry on our frames, the higher the caloric expenditure
          required. Weight training is necessary to increase muscle
          mass.<br>
          <br>
          A common belief among beginning fitness enthusiasts is the
          need for hours and hours of high intensity aerobic exercise
          for fat loss. The reality is just the opposite. Aerobic
          exercise certainly helps to burn fat, but does relatively
          little to increase overall metabolic rate in comparison with
          muscular gain due to a consistent resistance training program.
          A concern for increasing muscle mass is imperative for
          successful loss of fat content.<br>
          <br>
          <b>10. Looking for the "easy way out."</b><br>
          <br>
          Whether it’s winning the lottery or having the perfect body,
          we all want something for nothing. One look at late-night
          infomercials and you can see all the bogus advertisements that
          promise weight loss by either popping a pill, drinking a
          shake, or buying some revolutionary new piece of equipment.
          Even factions of the medical community have jumped on the
          bandwagon in recent years, promising the body of our dreams
          through a variety of surgical procedures.<br>
          <br>
          The main concept of weight loss, calories in vs. calories out,
          is simple but far from easy. Only with dedication, work, and
          healthy lifestyle changes are results going to happen. And
          forget the quick fixes. They don’t exist. <br>
          <br>
          Cher said it best in a fitness commercial back in the 80’s:
          "If it came in a bottle, we’d all have a beautiful body."<br>
