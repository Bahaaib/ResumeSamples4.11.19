          With all of the information out there, I'm pretty sure you
          have a decent idea about what needs to be done in order to
          lose weight. Bottom line? Eat healthy foods and exercise. This
          sounds simple enough, but for many people it's a struggle. The
          struggle most people face isn't in knowing what to do, it's
          doing it. Passing up certain foods; having the will to say no;
          getting motivated enough to get dressed and actually go to the
          gym. This becomes particularly difficult when faced with
          self-sabotaging thoughts like "Go ahead and eat it. One time
          won't hurt you", or "You've been good all week, you deserve to
          reward yourself". This type of self-talk in an indication that
          your mind is working against you, not for you. So how can we
          change these thoughts? <br>
          <br>
          Commitment. There really is no way around this if you want to
          look and feel healthy and fit. I've compiled a few practical
          tips that will help you keep the cookies out of your mouth and
          will push you to the gym while your mind is scrambling to find
          all sorts of reasons why you can't or shouldn't (so much for
          loyalty). It comes up with some good ones too, doesn't it? The
          good news is, very soon these actions will become habit and
          you will no longer view it as a struggle, but as a refreshing
          way to live.<br>
          <br>
          1. Put the food away. Do not leave food out in the open unless
          it's fruits and veggies. Believe it or not, this one little
          step will enormously impact your tendency to overeat and spare
          you the guilt feelings that follow. I've been in numerous
          houses where cookies, cakes, bags of potato chips - you name
          it, are left out in the open (on the counter, on top of the
          refrigerator, etc.) This is a huge no-no. Put it all away and
          out of sight. After a meal, wrap up the leftovers immediately
          and put them away. Do not allow them to linger on the stove or
          table. The old saying "Out of sight out of mind" bears some
          recognition here. If your first thought after reading that was
          "Yeah, but they also say absence makes the heart grow fonder"
          then you're riding the super sabotage train and need to take a
          time out to get your mind back on the right track! Though we
          should never beat ourselves up when we have moments of
          weakness, we should still be firm with ourselves. Get over any
          Betty Crocker mishaps and move forward, but don't use that as
          reasoning to continue to indulge either. I used to get over it
          and move forward every day until I realized the scale was
          moving forward with me. <br>
          <br>
          2. Stay out of the kitchen. Unless you are in there for a
          specific purpose, do not gravitate to the kitchen. It's where
          the food is. Start spending more time in the living room,
          outside, wherever. But unless you're in the kitchen to prepare
          an actual meal or make a cup of tea, get out. Harsh? Maybe.
          But it will keep the cookies out of your belly. That is if
          you're still buying those things. I hope not. <br>
          <br>
          3. Call a family meeting. I have found that those with
          children or large families have a more difficult time losing
          weight than those who do not. Especially, if you're the
          honorary chef. This calls for a family meeting. Let everyone
          know of your intent to eat healthier and lose weight and allow
          them to get involved in your success. Make and take
          suggestions on how this can be a win-win for the entire
          family. Better yet, make it a family project. Seriously.
          Making healthy meals for the entire family is the preferred
          route because it allows them to benefit from the same healthy
          foods and habits. However, if for some reason the family plan
          is not doable right away, and they are insisting on your
          famous apple pie, some provisions will have to be made for
          you. <br>
          <br>
          4. Change your perspective. Look at losing weight as a
          self-health project rather than a look-good project. Each day
          you will become healthier, stronger and your body will run
          more efficiently, gaining more and more energy along the way.
          Let's not forget, you'll look great! The benefits to losing
          weight the right way are long term and far outweigh any short
          term effort. Healthy looking skin, slower aging and more
          energy are just a few of the benefits to better health.
          Changing one's lifestyle to include foods such as fresh
          vegetables, fruits, lean meats and whole grains along with
          regular exercise will heal more than just your body; it will
          heal many areas of your life. I promise.<br>
          <br>
          5. Get your gym bag ready the night before. There is something
          to be said for preparing in advance. When I get up in the
          morning, my gym bag is staring me in the face and ready to go.
          It's just a matter of me slipping into my gym clothes and
          hitting the door. Well, I stop to brush my teeth first, of
          course. Take your shower at the gym, it saves time. But
          please, don't forget to pack the flip flops. <br>
          <br>
          6. Visualize. I use visualization in all areas of my life and
          I believe it to be one of the most powerful and effective
          methods of manifesting a desire. Visualize the body that you
          want, and visualize it exercising at peak levels. For
          instance, picture your desired body running a marathon. When
          you visualize, you must place yourself in that moment and
          allow yourself to feel all of the emotions of it, as if it
          were actually happening. This is powerful. Do it daily. Pretty
          soon you will find yourself craving healthy foods and
          exercise. No kidding. <br>
          <br>
          7. Exercise early. This may not be possible for everyone since
          work and family schedules are different for each individual,
          but if possible get to the gym first thing in the morning. If
          need be, wake up an hour or so earlier. It's well worth it.
          Not only will you get it out of the way but you will have
          outsmarted your excuse making mind. Also, it won't be a source
          of stress all day (the anticipation) and you'll start the day
          with your fat burning furnace on high and mucho energy! As an
          extra bonus, your evening will be free to relax. I highly
          recommend this. <br>
          <br>
          8. Buy foods that you can snack on. Find a healthy food that
          you really like and use it to snack on when you feel yourself
          losing control. I like crunchy snacks, so for me it was baby
          carrots. Of course, I would have preferred the potato chips
          (okay, I like salty, crunchy foods). Nonetheless, grabbing the
          carrots kept me from grabbing the potato chips. It was a
          little disappointing in flavor and texture at first, but
          eventually I began to prefer them. Yes, it's true. I would dip
          the carrots in salsa (which has virtually no fat for you salsa
          lovers). This replaced the salty cravings. Get creative. There
          are a lot of healthy snacks to be discovered, but be wise.
          There are a lot of misleading labels out there. Try sticking
          with fresh foods. Processed foods are never the right choice.
          <br>
          <br>
          9. Get enough rest. You should get 7-8 hours of sleep at
          night. Do your best to make this happen, not only for your
          overall health, but also to ensure that you will have enough
          fuel for your workouts. Also, lack of sleep causes hunger.
          It's bad enough staying out of the kitchen and packing a gym
          bag before bed. Why push it. <br>
          <br>
          10. Cook in advance. If you are going to cook separately for
          your family, prepare your meal in advance. This will ease the
          temptation to eat what you've prepared for them. Again, the
          best scenario would be to include your family, promote change
          and incorporate healthy foods into their diets as well. As a
          parent of course, you can insist. They'll love you for it
          later. As for significant others, I'll just leave that to you.
          <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;Weight loss is an ongoing struggle for many people, but
          it doesn't have to be. Once you've made a mental commitment to
          become healthy and fit, it won't be long until you are reaping
          the rewards. Soon, it will become a state of mind rather than
          a task so hang in there! It is well worth every effort you
          make. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;You can do this. You have an amazing amount of power
          inside of you to be successful in anything you set your mind
          to. Make it happen! <br>
          <br>
          * If you have any health issues, please check with your doctor
          before incorporating any changes in your diet or exercise
          routine.<br>
