          Our metabolic rate determines the rate at which we ‘burn up’
          our food, and by increasing this rate, we can lose weight more
          quickly, easily, and safely.<br>
          <br>
          When we diet, by decreasing our calorie intake too
          drastically, we cause our metabolism to slow down, making it
          progressively more difficult for us to lose weight. Most diets
          fail, yet we continue to try one after another, always hoping
          that each new regime will provide the ‘magic’ solution. If
          this sounds like your problem, there may be a simple answer.
          Let’s look at why most diets fail, and how strength training,
          combined with a healthy food intake can speed up your
          metabolism, making it easy for you to lose weight.<br>
          <br>
          By drastically cutting our food intake, our body’s natural
          instinct is to switch to a ‘starvation response.' The fewer
          calories we consume, the more our bodies become efficient at
          using these calories - leading to slower weight loss. This was
          once a useful mechanism for our ancestors when food supplies
          were less predictable, but this ’vicious circle’ can make life
          almost impossible for the modern dieter.<br>
          <br>
          When the body is persistently kept short of calories, it
          breaks down muscle tissue to use as fuel. Our body, using
          water from our tissue cells, quickly washes this away causing
          an instant reduction in weight through water loss. However,
          this weight loss will be short lived, and will quickly be
          regained when we take in water and the muscle we have lost
          will slow down our metabolism in the long term.<br>
          <br>
          The reason for this is that each pound of muscle requires a
          certain number of calories each day just to maintain it.
          Therefore, the more muscle you have, the more calories you
          burn even when you’re doing nothing, even sleeping! If you
          lose muscle, then your daily calorie requirement becomes less.
          For example, imagine a dieter loses 10 pounds of muscle (along
          with maybe 20 lbs. of fat) on a strict diet. Now suppose that
          each pound of muscle had been burning 50 calories a day.
          Together, those 10 pounds of muscle had been burning 500
          calories a day. With this muscle tissue gone, the dieter must
          now consume 500 less calories a day in order to maintain that
          weight-loss!<br>
          <br>
          However, of course people do not stick to their diets for ever
          and when they return to their old eating habits, the weight
          that they have lost, invariably comes piling back on.
          Unfortunately, whilst they lost both muscle and fat during the
          diet, all the weight they regained was fat. So, even though
          they may weigh the same as they did when they started, they
          now have a lot more fat and a lot less muscle than they did
          before the diet. Therefore, their metabolism is slower and
          their calorie requirements are less. Even if they return to
          their pre-diet eating habits, they still require 500 fewer
          calories a day due to the muscle loss. That’s one reason
          dieters are prone to regaining all of the lost weight, and
          conversely sometimes even gain weight afterwards.<br>
          <br>
          A good solution is an active lifestyle that includes aerobic
          exercise, a good weight-training program, and a healthy diet
          containing fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain cereals
          and plenty of lean protein. It is a good idea to eat ‘little
          and often’ – keeping your metabolism in high gear by eating 4
          to 6 small meals a day, rather than one or two larger ones. No
          food is forbidden, but sweets and high fat junk food are eaten
          less often, and in smaller quantities. A healthy diet is a
          realistic and permanent way of eating – not a diet that you
          suffer through for a week or two and then give up!<br>
          <br>
          The goal is to consume as many calories as you can, while
          still losing body fat and maintaining or adding lean muscle at
          the same time. If your calories are already below normal,
          don’t restrict them further. Instead, maintain your current
          amount and instead try to become stronger and more active, so
          you can gradually increase your calories to a normal healthy
          level. If your calorie intake is already in a healthy range,
          decrease it only slightly, if necessary. A small reduction of
          about 250 calories a day, or 10-15 percent less than usual, is
          more likely to protect your lean muscle, and less likely to
          trigger a go-slow in your metabolism.<br>
          <br>
          If you follow this type of routine, it’s possible to gain
          about one pound of muscle per week and lose about one pound of
          fat per week. The end result is that the number on the scale
          might not move much at all, it may even go up. Your clothes
          will feel looser, and you’ll feel great. Yet the numbers on
          the scale won't move!! It's at this point that a lot of people
          give up the weight training because they don't understand
          what's happening.<br>
          <br>
          The truth is that when you're strength training it's possible
          to get smaller and heavier at the same time, as muscle is a
          much denser tissue than fat. The fat takes up more space on
          your body. At this point, it's best to ignore the bathroom
          scales and rely on the way you look and the way your clothes
          fit.<br>
          <br>
          The conventional way of dieting can lead to a weak, tired
          body, exhausted by the constant cycle of starvation and weight
          gain, unable to enjoy food. However, by following these easy
          steps above, you can easily reach your goal - the slim,
          strong, healthy body of a naturally lean person who can enjoy
          their food without guilt, for life!<br>
