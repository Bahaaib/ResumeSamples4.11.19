          Have you ever dreamed of being like JK Rowling, Steven King or
          Danielle
          Steel?&nbsp; Each of these individuals make tons of money
          romping
          through their imaginations as they create fascinating
          novels.&nbsp;
          Well, if you form a home based business around ghostwriting,
          you can be
          just like them.&nbsp; You may not get their fame, but you will
          get
          their salaries as a ghostwritten novel of 250 pages starts at
          an
          astounding $20,000.<br>
          <br>
          So, how exactly can you form a home based business around
          ghostwriting?&nbsp; First, you will need a portfolio.&nbsp;
          This is an
          essential element of any home based business.&nbsp; This
          portfolio
          should contain your resume, contactable references and most
          importantly
          previous novels you have written and published. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Ghostwriters who find the most success for their home based
          business
          tend to have already been picked up by a major publishing
          company.&nbsp; But if you haven’t been able to do that,
          don’t worry.&nbsp; You can still make a portfolio for your
          ghostwriting business by using a print-on-demand
          service.&nbsp; These
          are companies that will publish your book at a nominal
          fee.&nbsp; If
          someone would like to purchase your book, the print-on-demand
          company
          would then do what is necessary to offer them a printed
          copy.&nbsp;
          Although this is not as prestigious as getting recognition
          from a
          ‘regular’ publishing company, it still shows that you have
          the capacity for completing a novel.<br>
          <br>
          The next thing you will need to if you want to make a home
          based
          business around ghostwriting is to create a website.&nbsp;
          This can be
          done through a word processor, HTML editor or through
          templates
          provided with a web hosting company.&nbsp; Of these
          alternatives you
          will find that it is easiest if you use a web hosting company.
          &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          All you really have to do is type in your information, and
          within less
          than an hour, you will have a home based business site.&nbsp;
          And when
          it comes to the information you use on your site, it doesn’t
          have
          to be elaborate.&nbsp; Just include the following elements:
          samples of
          your work, links to where your published material can be
          bought,
          testimonials and most importantly pricing.&nbsp; Many
          ghostwriters
          neglect to put pricing information on their site because they
          fear it
          will drive customers away.&nbsp; But your potential customers
          will have
          a lot of appreciation for you if you put that info upfront for
          them,
          since it saves them the time of making an extra inquiry.&nbsp;
          If your
          prices are incredibly high, list what your fee is per hour or
          per page
          rather than per novel. &nbsp;<br>
          This way consumers with less money may still consider you for
          partial
          ghostwriting projects.<br>
          <br>
          Once your website is up, you will need to market your new home
          based
          business.&nbsp; The best way to do this is by targeting
          individuals who
          are rich, (those making six figure salaries).&nbsp; These are
          the
          markets that are more likely to be able to pay the $20,000
          plus fee for
          a ghostwritten novel. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          To market to these individuals you will need to do a bit of
          sleuthing.
          You can start by driving around the ‘rich’ communities in
          your area.&nbsp; Have a passenger take not of the
          addresses.&nbsp; You
          now have what you need to embark on a direct mail
          campaign.&nbsp; When
          you create your postcard, try to appeal to a person’s sense of
          self-actualization by emphasizing the fame and fortune they
          can get by
          publishing a novel. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          However, keep in mind that even for the rich $20,000 is
          pricey,
          especially if the ghostwriter is not well-known.&nbsp; So you
          may have
          to send out 1,000 direct mails before you see anything.&nbsp;
          But it
          only takes a handful of leads to get you a salary that could
          last you
          the rest of the year.<br>
