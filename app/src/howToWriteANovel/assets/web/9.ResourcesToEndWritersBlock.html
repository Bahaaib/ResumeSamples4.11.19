          Writers block is one of those mysterious ailments that is
          blamed for
          late assignments, missed deadlines, and failed dreams. Some
          people
          claim it is merely a myth while others find it plagues their
          writing.<br>
          <br>
          As someone with more than two decades of professional writing,
          editing
          and teaching experience I feel quite strongly that in 99.9
          percent of
          reported cases of writers block are nothing more than a
          chimera. In my
          opinion, far too many would-be writers spend far too much time
          and
          energy on finding the right computer, program, paper, pen,
          location,
          mood-setting music, and the like before they can begin writing
          when
          that time and energy would be much better spent on simply
          getting down
          to the business of writing. These would-be writers treat their
          muse as
          something delicate and breakable, something as elusive and
          fleeting as
          smoke.<br>
          <br>
          I know from years spent in the hurly-burly of newspaper
          reporting and
          snatching moments to write between deadlines and dinner dishes
          that a
          muse worth keeping is made of much tougher material and in
          fact may
          benefit from some abuse.<br>
          <br>
          Most often writers block, or what is commonly referred to as
          writers
          block, is caused by one of three problems--lack of
          preparation, lack of
          training, and lack of development. Lack of preparation is
          often caused
          by not creating an individual writing process that can take
          advantage
          of your writing strengths and help overcome your writing
          weaknesses.
          Lack of training is similar to athletic training--you need to
          warm up
          and work out on a regular schedule to keep your writing
          muscles in top
          condition. Lack of development simply means that your
          particular idea
          may need more time to percolate or perhaps you are not ready
          to tackle
          that particular topic at the time.<br>
          <br>
          I have three recommendations to help you work through writers
          block.
          First is to simply write through it. Give yourself permission
          to write
          garbage and focus on simply creating a really rough draft.
          Often once
          you stop worrying over all that is wrong with your writing the
          words
          will begin flowing again.<br>
          <br>
          A second method of dealing with writers block is to get
          moving. Take a
          walk or hike. Do something physical away from your office or
          desk and
          do not let yourself return to the scene of the crime (or
          writers block)
          until several hours have passed. You might be surprised what
          your brain
          works out in the interim.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, exercise and challenge your writing muscles with
          writing
          prompts and exercises. Sometimes simply changing the pace of
          your
          writing or your subject matter can be enough to help you work
          through
          your difficulty.<br>
          <br>
          Remember, every writer experiences some form of writers block
          from time
          to time but you do not have to make a mountain out of a
          molehill.
          Working out an effective strategy to circumvent writers block
          when it
          strikes is one of the most important skills a real writer can
          develop.<br>
