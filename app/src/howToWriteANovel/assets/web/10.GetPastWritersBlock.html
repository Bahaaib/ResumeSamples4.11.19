          Overcoming writer’s block has so many prescribed cures that
          seem
          like witches’ brew, you may as well be trying to get rid of
          hiccups. My favorite remedy is “just write anything.” If I
          were to follow this advice when I’m stuck in a frustrating
          blank
          stare moment, my page would be filled with expletives that
          would be of
          no use to anyone, including Lenny Bruce.<br>

          If you have no idea of what to say on any given subject, you
          do not
          have writer’s block, you have a lack of knowledge problem. If
          you
          have the facts in front of you and still do not know what to
          say then
          you have writer’s block. The basic step of gathering enough
          material to complete your writing task should never be
          confused with
          writer’s block. <br>
          <br>
          Writing takes leg work - tedious legwork. Before the Internet
          this task
          could seem insurmountable; but now with worlds of knowledge at
          our
          fingertips, I don’t want to hear about any problems getting
          background material on any subject. Learn how to use the
          search engines
          well. This should already be part of your writer’s skill set.<br>
          <br>
          Genuine writer’s block comes when you “just don’t
          know how to say it.” You have the information, a basic
          outline,
          yet you are not satisfied with the tone, cadence or anecdote
          provided.
          It just doesn’t feel right. You can’t tie your ideas
          together into one cohesive product that supports the
          underlying theme
          you are trying to convey. What do you do?<br>
          <br>
          Take your material and write it out as you have it. Even if
          doesn’t feel right complete your assignment as if it were due
          today, and walk away. Leave the problem to rattle around in
          your brain
          for a while. Now here comes they key. Do something totally
          unrelated
          that requires you to pay some attention to your new task - a
          household
          chore, returning emails, running an errand. I generally find a
          physical
          chore, like walking to the post office to be superior to a
          mental chore
          like answering emails. Exercise is one of the great
          inspirational tools
          available to us. <br>
          <br>
          If you exercise regularly this would be a great time to do
          that.
          Sometime during your chore or exercise the answer will pop
          into your
          head. That is the way our brains work. Inspiration comes to us
          all the
          time. We need to be distracted from the noise that interfering
          with our
          ability to hear the inspiration. <br>
          <br>
          Once we have changed our focus away from the problem at hand
          our brain
          can finally deliver the answer unimpeded. Whether you believe
          the
          answer has come from your brain or from the cosmos the answer
          is always
          available to us. Sometimes more than one chore is required for
          distraction. On a big problem it might take a week of chores.
          <br>
          <br>
          Be absolutely sure you have a pen and pad of paper with you at
          all
          times, because the answer may be fleeting, or just a partial
          answer
          with the remaining portion to show up at a later time.<br>
          <br>
          Most writers are working on more than one project at a time.
          Leaving
          one assignment and starting another can also help in getting
          the answer
          to a previous writing problem. Remember; never confuse lack of
          preparation with writer’s block. Lack of preparation is a
          matter
          of laziness and is a whole different problem to overcome.<br>
