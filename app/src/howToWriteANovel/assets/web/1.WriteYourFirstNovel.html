          If you’ve always wanted to write a novel, but found the
          traditional structured process too frightening or
          overwhelming, maybe
          your imagination works in a more organic fashion like mine. In
          that
          case, start with your main character and the idea the
          character gives
          you for the plot. Then close your eyes, grab your notebook or
          computer,
          and watch the main character. Sooner or later she or he will
          begin
          talking and moving around. When that happens, start writing! I
          guarantee what you hear and see will thoroughly surprise and
          delight
          you.<br>
          <br>
          Even though my books are considered literary novels, I’ve
          always
          admired the mysteries of Tony Hillerman, and the way he laces
          his
          novels with information about the Native American tribes in
          his area. I
          call books like these “info novels,” and they are great fun
          if you’ve never read one. That is also a goal I try to achieve
          with my Occult novels. With these I’ve been able to weave
          information about contemporary Pagan life, as well as real
          spells,
          chants, or rituals throughout every chapter. This series also
          provides
          a wonderful opportunity to add data of interest to my women
          readers
          about holistic healing, feral cat rescue, perimenopause,
          fibroids, and
          much more.<br>
          <br>
          Anyone who would like to undertake a big project like a first
          novel
          should know the sky is the limit. If organic structure
          development,
          experimental formats, and “info novels” appeal to you, go
          for it! Don’t worry if your ideas differ from the traditional
          novel. And don’t be afraid to seed your novel with
          information.
          Just make sure it occurs naturally within the flow of the
          storyline.
          For good examples, read the “info novels” written by
          novelists who excel in this form.<br>
          <br>
          Also, don’t let your first draft scare you, because all first
          drafts tend to be utterly frightening. A first draft has only
          one
          purpose: it’s the place where you put your ideas down on
          paper.
          The editing of the first draft is where the magic happens.
          When I
          create the first draft of each chapter, it is an exhilarating
          experience. A real adrenaline rush! But I am first and
          foremost a poet,
          and like most poets I love to edit. It’s the polishing of each
          scene, sculpting it to sail smoothly into the next that gives
          me the
          greatest joy.<br>
          <br>
          In fact I am currently working on a new novel, which is
          proving to be
          the most organic and intuitive one I’ve ever attempted, making
          it
          great fun to write. All I started with this time was the main
          character
          and her cats. She never told me her idea for a plot, so I just
          followed
          her around, writing down her thoughts, words, and actions as
          she moved
          from scene to scene. Suddenly, other characters appeared, and
          exciting
          subplots began to emerge.<br>
          <br>
          Now I am six chapters into this novel. The first five chapters
          have
          already been published or accepted by literary journals,
          because I
          always submit each finished chapter as a short story to gain
          publication credits for the novel. Yet the main character
          still
          hasn’t revealed the plot to me. No problem. This novel seems
          to
          be following its own organic, information-rich course, and
          those
          who’ve read several of these chapters have enjoyed them
          immensely
          and can’t wait to find out what happens next. Me too!<br>
          <br>
          Don’t let fear stop you from writing the novel that’s been
          bubbling around in your imagination for days, months, or
          years. Most of
          all, don’t let a lack of money or education stop you. I never
          took a writing class, and nineteen years later I’ve published
          more than thirty poetry books and novels. My poems and short
          stories
          have appeared in over seven hundred literary journals,
          magazines, and
          anthologies worldwide. How did I do it? I used what was
          available to
          me. I found my high school and college grammar books and
          studied those.
          And then I read the poetry books and novels of writers I
          admire, and
          that’s how I learned to write.<br>
          <br>
          Sometimes if your mind works in an organic fashion this may be
          the best
          way to tackle your first novel. Then all you’ll need to do is
          let
          go, give total control to an imaginary character who lives in
          your
          head, listen to what she or he says, and start writing!<br>
