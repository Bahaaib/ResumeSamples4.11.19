          Can a city be a character in a book? Many years ago, in a
          writing
          class, I was told that I should try to make the setting, which
          was
          Toronto, my city of birth, a character in my book, Conduct in
          Question.
          I have puzzled over this piece of advice for many years and
          only now
          think I may have an answer as to its meaning.<br>
          <br>
          Here’s another question. Can the city you’ve lived in all
          your life be a character or does intimacy somehow disqualify
          it? I have
          often longed to see Toronto with the eyes of a visitor but
          unfortunately, that is surprisingly hard to do.<br>
          <br>
          I was reading Alain De Botton’s delightful book, The Art of
          Travel. He maintains that when we travel, we adopt, if we are
          lucky, a
          traveler’s receptive mind-set. Somehow, we North Americans
          walking around Paris or Buenos Aires are much more open to
          what we see
          than if we were at home. We ask questions. We see these places
          with
          ‘fresh’ eyes and a sense of wonder. However, at home, says
          De Botton, we have become so habituated to our surroundings
          that we
          scarcely notice them.<br>
          <br>
          So, how can a writer hope to make his own hometown an
          effective
          setting, [given his habituation] much less an interesting
          character?
          After all, if we are blind to our everyday surroundings, can
          we ever
          hope to see them with fresh eyes?<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps the answer lies in the distinction between intimacy
          and
          familiarity. Intimacy with a lover suggests deep, unconscious
          involvement. Familiarity perhaps connotes staying on the
          surface with a
          case of borderline boredom. And so, intimacy with one’s home
          may
          suggest deep knowledge, not boredom.<br>
          <br>
          I found a clue in reading Jan Morris, one of the world’s
          finest
          and most experienced travel writers. She gave Torontonians a
          ‘snapshot’ of their city in the early 1980’s. Here
          are some of the descriptive words she used. The people
          appeared calm,
          dispassionate, polite, determined, joyless, resigned and
          reticent. Wow!
          Who would want to visit us? Furthermore, the city is conducive
          to
          self-doubt and introspection. This does not sound like a great
          party
          place!<br>
          <br>
          But she’s right, at least in part. Torontonians, on the
          surface,
          are notoriously reserved and polite to the extent of appearing
          cold,
          unfriendly and formal. But, as one who has lived a lifetime
          here,
          I’d argue that that is only part of the story.<br>
          <br>
          If you’ve ever visited Toronto, you will know a bit about its
          geography. It sits on a huge body of water [Lake Ontario] and
          is
          riddled with ravines. These are gorgeous, deep cut chasms left
          in their
          state of nature. If you are walking along St Clair Avenue, in
          the
          middle of traffic, shops, offices and cafes, you could turn
          down a path
          at a bridge and find yourself in an entirely different world.
          Trees,
          bushes, shrubs, all manner of plant life await you along with
          the
          occasional skunk or fox. And it is amazingly quiet. The
          rumblings of
          traffic grow distant and at last you hear the songbirds. It’s
          a
          bit like achieving a different state of consciousness.<br>
          <br>
          I love this image. Within a very short distance of the sleek,
          glistening towers of banks and businesses, the snarl of
          traffic, all
          creating an extraordinarily highly, polished surface, nature
          runs riot.<br>
          <br>
          Doesn’t that make you think of what people are like? Each day,
          we
          dress up, putting on our public mask. And we submerge, for a
          time, all
          the mutinous rumblings of our inner selves. How like Toronto
          is to its
          people!<br>
          <br>
          Last year, Conduct in Question [the first in the Osgoode
          Trilogy] was
          published. Harry Jenkins is the protagonist lawyer practicing
          in
          Toronto. On reflection, I have to admit that Harry is a lot
          like the
          city I’ve just been describing. At the beginning of Conduct in
          Question he is trapped in a creaky, old law firm under his
          senior
          partner’s thumb and in a dead marriage of twenty years. But
          mutinous rumblings lie within Harry. I’m in my late forties.
          Am I
          running out of time? Can I make more money?&nbsp; How much
          money is
          enough?<br>
          <br>
          And, what do you know? Harry is reserved, reticent,
          introspective and
          subject to self-doubt. On the polished surface of life, things
          aren’t so bad, but something is missing. It takes murder and
          fraud [catapulted down into the wilds of the ravines] to burst
          open his
          life and get him really living again.&nbsp; In the second
          novel of the
          trilogy, Final Paradox, I got very interested in the role
          masks play in
          the lives of people. Harry is once again caught up in murder
          and fraud
          and this time the question is can love and forgiveness be
          found amid
          fraud and deceit? And so, [metaphorically speaking] Harry is
          thrust
          down into the ravines of his psyche to come up with the
          answers.<br>
          <br>
          So, yes, I think I understand how a city [the setting] can
          become a
          character and also influence the other characters and themes
          in a
          novel. I’ve been greatly affected by the central image of
          Toronto
          with its polished, sophisticated surface contrasted with what
          lurks
          under the bridges. That image is what lies under the Osgoode
          Trilogy.<br>
