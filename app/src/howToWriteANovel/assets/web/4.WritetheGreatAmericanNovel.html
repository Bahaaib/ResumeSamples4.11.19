          How many times when you was moving through the decades of
          raising a
          family and building a career did you say that you were going
          to write
          the great American novel when you retired?&nbsp; Now as you
          settle into
          a life of retirement and the lifestyle of a senior citizen, do
          you
          wonder if now might be the time?&nbsp; After all, this is the
          time of
          life when you always promised yourself you would uncork all of
          that
          creativity you have been keeping pent up all these years and
          let it
          spill out onto the world.&nbsp; So why not give it a
          try?&nbsp; Nobody
          ever got hurt trying for greatness.<br>
          <br>
          But even if you don’t achieve “greatness”, your years
          as a senior citizen are a wonderful time to explore the
          creative side
          of you.&nbsp; It might not be “the great American
          novel”.&nbsp; That phrase really is a way of expressing that
          we
          all have something creative and unique to give and our senior
          years are
          a great time to let them out.<br>
          <br>
          The idea that writing, or painting, or acting or any of the
          creative
          arts are the venue only of the young has been proven wrong
          time and
          time again.&nbsp; It seems creativity and creative expression
          really
          knows no age limits.&nbsp; In the last few years we have had
          Haley Joel
          Osment, Harrison Ford and Clint Eastwood all vying for the
          Academy
          award.&nbsp; That makes a 10 year old, a man in his late
          middle ages
          and a senior citizen all being evaluated by the same criteria
          for
          greatness in acting.&nbsp; The young boy didn’t win that year
          but
          keep your eyes on him.&nbsp; He has plenty more to give.<br>
          <br>
          In fact, it is notable that a few years later when Clint
          Eastwood won
          the Oscar for directing, he remarked that much older directors
          than him
          were still making their masterpieces.&nbsp; So he was a
          youngster in
          his 70s just getting started striving for greatness.&nbsp;
          These are
          just a few examples to show that if these senior citizens can
          shine in
          their creative work late in life, so can you.<br>
          <br>
          Don’t be afraid to get out there with the youngsters and take
          the
          introductory classes in the art form you want to try
          out.&nbsp; You may
          have always dreamed of painting.&nbsp; You know that Picasso
          and
          Rembrandt did some of their finest paintings as senior
          citizens.&nbsp;
          So go ahead, go to the junior college or the local museum and
          enroll in
          classes.&nbsp; You may be the Grandpa or Grandma of the class
          but once
          the other artists see that you have something burning inside
          you to
          express artistically, they will respect you as a fellow artist
          and peer
          in the artistic community.<br>
          <br>
          This is not to say that writing the great American novel or
          other forms
          of creative expression are not going to take work to
          master.&nbsp; But
          in that department, you also have the inside
          track.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a
          senior citizen, you are not stranger to hard work.&nbsp; You
          worked
          hard to raise a family, succeed in a career and provide for
          others all
          of your adult life.&nbsp; Now its time to use some of that
          work ethic
          to let your own light shine and for a little while, let it all
          be about
          you.<br>
