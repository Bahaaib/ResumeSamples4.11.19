          What do you do now that you have finished that great
          manuscript?&nbsp;
          Many believe you can simply start sending it out to agents or
          publishers sometimes even both.&nbsp; However this is simply
          not true,
          just because you have created this riveting tale, you cannot
          send it
          out and expect it to be published right then.&nbsp; No, there
          are many
          aspects to being published and even more frauds out there,
          where the
          only goal is to con you out of your money.&nbsp; Filling their
          pockets
          and leaving yours empty and your dream of being published
          unfulfilled.<br>
          <br>
          So what to do, where to turn, who do you trust, who do you
          ask?&nbsp;
          Well the first thing is take that perfect manuscript and
          reread each
          and every word and prepare to rewrite, if you are like many
          authors out
          there who have a hard time seeing their own mistakes then join
          a
          critique group.&nbsp; These groups are designed to help
          writers, and
          many have guidelines to follow so that your critique is
          accurate and
          fair.&nbsp; Once you have joined the group, redone your
          mistakes,
          repeatedly, finally believing you have the best Manuscript
          possible,
          here comes the hard part.&nbsp; Getting someone else to
          believe it as
          well.<br>
          <br>
          You have to come up with a query letter that holds the readers
          attention using a strong hook.&nbsp; A hook if you don't know
          is that
          one scene, that one line, that grabs the readers attention
          making them
          want more, need more of what you have to say.&nbsp; Once you
          have that
          Query here comes the synopsis, a synopsis is summary of your
          story
          highlighting plot twist and turns along with giving, a detail
          setting
          your story takes place in, generally about two to three pages
          in
          length.&nbsp; A word of advice when you write your synopsis,
          know the
          ending even if not exact, at least how it will end. Publishers
          and
          Agents do not want to be still guessing at the end.<br>
          <br>
          Ok you have your Query, your Synopsis, your sample Chapters
          leading
          into the story, now what?&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you make sure
          everything is
          formatted properly; this makes a huge difference on acceptance
          to being
          read or thrown away before they look at the first line?&nbsp;
          So
          everything is properly formatted, you have researched the
          agents and
          publishers, you know who you are going to send out to, but
          there is one
          major problem who first?<br>
          <br>
          Well that depends on your list, first off if you want an agent
          then
          they are the first ones to contact.&nbsp; A good agent will
          walk you
          through the process from, professional editing to submitting
          to the
          publisher.&nbsp; Agents will have Publishers they want to send
          to
          first, but you can suggest your own as well.&nbsp; A good
          agent will
          not charge you; they make money off getting that contract with
          the
          publisher.&nbsp; A good agent will keep you informed at all
          changes,
          but most importantly, a good agent will be looking out for
          you.<br>
          <br>
          Now that we know what an Agent does maybe, you are like
          hundreds of
          other authors and do not want an agent.&nbsp; Well that is ok
          too; many
          go straight to the publisher.&nbsp; Whether you self publish
          or have a
          publisher, you need to follow the company's guidelines and
          rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, remember that unless you are
          self-publishing
          then the Publisher pays you not the other way around.&nbsp; A
          publisher
          should also have a list of events and ideas they want to use
          to promote
          the book.<br>
          <br>
          No matter what way you choose to move that manuscript into a
          novel be
          sure to check out each publisher, editor, and agent on your
          list.&nbsp;
          Make sure they are legit, that they do not have any hidden
          fees, and
          any questions you have are answered completely before you sign
          that
          dotted line. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Remember you are in charge, it is your work, and you have a
          responsibility to yourself, your readers, and your publisher
          or agent,
          just because the hard parts are done, do not stop.&nbsp; Send
          it out
          for reviews, ask local books stores to carry it, promote,
          promote,
          promote.<br>
