          whitening strips are a popular and heavily marketed whitening
          product, but can simple strips whiten your teeth? The active
          ingredient
          in whitening strips is used in many different whitening
          products, but
          can a few thin strips really contain enough of this bleaching
          agent to
          get you the whiter smile you want? Are gels and toothpastes
          more
          effective than strips? Read on to find out.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Are Teeth Whitening
            Strips Really Effective At Whitening Teeth?</span><br>
          <br>
          Different whitening products will get you different results
          depending
          on the amount and concentration of the active whitening
          ingredient,
          called peroxide, that is found in the product. One of the most
          commonly
          used over the counter at home whitening products are teeth
          whitening
          strips. Whitening strips are made by a number of different
          manufacturers and vary greatly in the concentrations of
          peroxide used
          and in their whitening effectiveness.<br>
          <br>
          The strength of whitening strips depends on the amount of
          peroxide
          found in them, which isn't always as simple to tell as it
          should be.
          You'll want to stick to a reputable brand that is ADA approved
          for the
          best and safest results. Uncomfortable side effects are a
          possibility
          with any whitening product that uses peroxide, so the
          reputation of the
          brand matters when searching for a safe but effective product.<br>
          <br>
          The best whitening strips can make a significant difference in
          your
          smile and whiten your teeth by several shades, while less
          effective
          brands that use less peroxide will not get you the same
          results. When
          shopping online for a whitening product it's important to look
          at
          reviews and ratings to determine what product to purchase.<br>
          <br>
          In short, a high quality brand of whitening strips that
          contains a
          significant percentage of peroxide can whiten yellow stained
          teeth
          effectively. However, care must be taken when shopping to find
          an
          effective brand, and there are side effects to watch out for.

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">How Do Whitening Strips
            Compare With Gels and Toothpastes?</span><br>
          <br>
          Generally one teeth bleaching product will be more effective
          than
          another if it contains a greater concentration of the active
          whitening
          ingredient, peroxide. Whitening gels and strips are both quite
          effective at whitening teeth, though some gels can be
          purchased online
          which include a stronger concentration of peroxide than most
          whitening
          strips. However, since most whitening gels use carbamide
          peroxide and
          most whitening strips use hydrogen peroxide as their active
          ingredient,
          making a direct comparison between the two is not as simple as
          comparing the percentage of peroxide included in the product.<br>
          <br>
          Most whitening toothpastes do not include peroxide, though
          there are
          exceptions that are worth looking into, but instead rely on
          abrasives
          like baking soda and hydrated silica to scrape off stains on
          the outer
          layer of enamel. The downside to abrasion is that too much can
          remove
          enamel from your teeth, damaging them and making them
          sensitive and
          even more susceptible to staining. For this reason I recommend
          avoiding
          most popular whitening toothpastes and using a brand that
          features
          peroxide in addition to limited amounts of gentle abrasives.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">How Do Teeth Whitening
            Strips Work?</span><br>
          <br>
          The key whitening ingredient in whitening strips is peroxide.
          All teeth
          bleaching products like whitening gels, whitening pens, and
          whitening
          strips contain peroxide in one of two possible forms.
          Carbamide
          peroxide is the most commonly used in gels and can be found in
          some
          more effective whitening toothpastes as well, while hydrogen
          peroxide
          is typically used in whitening strips and whitening pens.<br>
          <br>
          Carbamide peroxide breaks down into hydrogen peroxide, meaning
          this
          form of peroxide is less effective at whitening than an equal
          concentration of hydrogen peroxide. In fact carbamide peroxide
          is
          around 1/3 the strength of the same concentration of hydrogen
          peroxide.
          Despite this carbamide is still an effective whitening agent
          and is
          often used in gels because it can be safer to handle than high
          concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. <br>
          <br>
          Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizer, meaning it breaks down
          itself into
          oxygen and water. The concentrated oxygen penetrating through
          the pores
          of your enamel into your teeth is what breaks apart the stains
          that
          discolor you teeth. These stain pigments are torn apart at a
          molecular
          level by the oxygen. This is why peroxide whitening gels and
          strips are
          more effective at whitening teeth than abrasives like baking
          soda or
          most whitening toothpastes, which don't include peroxide.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">What Are The Side Effects
            Of Using Teeth Whitening Strips?</span><br>
          <br>
          Like all peroxide whitening products, teeth whitening strips
          have a
          risk of side effects. Specifically, you need to be aware of
          the
          potential for increased tooth sensitivity and possible gum
          irritation. <br>
          <br>
          A temporary increase in dental sensitivity to extreme
          temperatures is a
          common side effect of whitening your teeth with peroxide. This
          means it
          can be painful to eat ice cream or drink hot coffee. This side
          effect
          will diminish and eventually disappear once you stop your
          whitening
          treatment. The best way to avoid this or to quicken recovery
          from it is
          to use a restorative toothpaste to repair the structure of
          your teeth
          and decrease sensitivity before beginning your whitening
          regimen.<br>
          <br>
          Gum irritation can be limited by carefully applying the strips
          so that
          they do not come into contact with your gums. Depending on the
          brand of
          strips and their size, this may be difficult to avoid.<br>
          <br>
          You can also decrease the time you wear the whitening strips
          to
          decrease the risk of sensitivity and gum irritation, however
          this will
          of course decrease the effectiveness of the whitening process.
          Despite
          this you can still get great whitening results by wearing the
          strips
          only on every other day and using a high quality whitening
          toothpaste
          in conjunction with them.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Should They Be Used With
            Other Whitening Products Or By Themselves?</span><br>
          <br>
          To avoid the side effects associated with peroxide teeth
          bleaching you
          should only use one high concentration peroxide whitening
          product at a
          time. Choose a quality brand of whitening gel, whitening
          strips or a
          whitening pen and use it according to the directions. Continue
          to brush
          regularly with a high quality toothpaste, either a restorative
          toothpaste if you are suffering from sensitive teeth, or a
          whitening
          toothpaste to maintain the new smile you'll receive from a
          peroxide
          whitening product.<br>
          <br>
          Remember that no peroxide-based whitening product can whiten
          crowns or
          capped teeth, since peroxide can only whiten the natural tooth
          enamel.
          It's also important to know that stains caused by
          tetracycline, which
          cause teeth to become a shade of gray, are much more difficult
          to
          whiten than yellow stains caused by food. While whitening
          strips used
          correctly can provide noticeable results of up to several
          shades
          lighter teeth, it's helpful to temper your expectations. No
          over the
          counter product can get you movie star white teeth, but you
          can get a
          significantly whiter smile that lets you brighten up a room
          with a
          quality brand of whitening strips.<br>
