    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>People
          are talking about ways to do it, trying it at home, selling it
          or buying it and of course writing about it...<br>
          <br>
          Teeth Whitening is what's buzzing these days around Hollywood,
          cities
          all across the US and around the world. Every day, we are
          increasingly
          becoming more aware of different ways to stay healthy and to
          enhance
          our appearance, even through our teeth. Smiles are getting
          whiter and
          brighter and everyone is taking notice.<br>
          <br>
          It's a natural instinct of how we interpret beauty, even
          hundreds or
          thousands of years ago, mankind preferred pearly whites as
          opposed to
          discolored teeth. When someone had white teeth it was regarded
          as a
          sign of beauty and wealth. It was important to have a white
          smile that
          complimented their outward appearance and social status, which
          in many
          cases is as much part of our life now as it was then.<br>
          <br>
          However, it wasn't until the early part of this decade, that
          teeth
          whitening became much less complex and convenient. Some of the
          best
          systems use custom fit molded trays to ensure the whitening
          gel stays
          on for even whitening.<br>
          <br>
          Today in the United States alone, cosmetic dentistry brings
          billions of
          dollars in revenue with teeth whitening being at the
          forefront. Having
          whiter teeth can boost confidence. In these hard economic
          times, we
          welcome this type of positive change to help us face the world
          with a
          smile. Whitening teeth can still be considered a wise
          investment: it
          lasts long, it's consistent, and it's safe.<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps you were told by your dentist, family or friends, to
          cut down
          on your morning coffee, afternoon tea, wine with dinner, or
          whatever
          your staining culprit may be, but how many of you really want
          to? And
          have you ever been around people who skipped their morning
          coffee?<br>
          <br>
          If you haven't tried to whiten your teeth, then you are
          probably at the
          least considering it. Finding a realistic and pleasant way for
          you to
          finally say good-bye to stained teeth is a lot easier than you
          may
          think.<br>
          <br>
          I'm a green tea, cappuccino, iced latte and red or white wine
          girl
          myself, although it's the red wine that stains your teeth. I
          have been
          eating more dark chocolate due to its antioxidant benefits,
          but it
          tends to cause more stains than milk chocolate. I haven't
          stopped
          consuming any of my favorite foods or drinks and my teeth look
          great.<br>
          <br>
          I whitened my teeth six years ago with an at home professional
          whitening kit. Since then, I receive compliments like, "your
          teeth are
          so straight and white"! They were always straight, but no one
          really
          noticed before. For maintenance, I use the 22% carbamide
          whitening gels
          stored in my fridge for about 30 minutes for just two days in
          a row
          while I'm relaxing or writing and my teeth return to the same
          level of
          whiteness.<br>
          <br>
          Before I learned I did not need a dentist to purchase
          professional
          strength kits, I spent a lot of money trying out the systems
          sold in
          supermarkets. None of them really worked and combined they
          cost me well
          over the whitening kit I purchased online, which is the same
          type of
          system dentists use for their patients.<br>
          <br>
          Let's go back and explore when and where it all started to
          understand
          how far the teeth whitening industry has really come. Teeth
          whitening
          began 4,000 years ago according to historians, who discovered
          that
          Ancient Egyptians kept their teeth clean by mixing grounded
          pumice
          stones and vinegar to form a paste. Chewing sticks were then
          used to
          remove plaque and help whiten their teeth. This method is the
          closest
          comparison to our style of tooth brushing and I think quite
          clever.
          Their methods were obviously much more challenging, but that
          still
          didn't stop them from trying get their white smiles. The
          Romans for
          example, used their own urine to whiten the teeth.<br>
          <br>
          By the 17th century, it was the local barbers who whitened
          teeth,
          performed tooth extractions or minor tooth surgeries. They
          used a much
          harsher method to clean and treat discolored teeth by filing
          them down
          first and then soaking them nitric acid. Ouch! This caused
          enormous
          pain and discomfort to their patients for obvious reasons.
          Unfortunately, although people were gaining whiter teeth, they
          were
          losing their enamel in the process. Around this time, Italian
          dentists
          introduced fluoride to keep their patients' teeth clean,
          cavity free
          and white. This didn't last very long either after it was
          discovered
          using large amounts of fluoride had opposite effect. This was
          especially the case among children who swallowed more fluoride
          than
          they were spitting out, causing their teeth to turn yellow
          years later.<br>
          <br>
          In the 1970's, the term cosmetic dentistry meant using
          toothpaste with
          a small amount of bleaching agent called hydrogen peroxide. In
          the
          early '90's, there was only one option if you wanted a high
          quality
          whitening process, a trip to the dentist. I personally love my
          dentist.
          I know, sounds strange but he is very good at what he does and
          my teeth
          are grateful, I just wouldn't book an appointment with him to
          get my
          teeth whitened. This would cost me hundreds of dollars, and it
          would be
          more time-consuming if I factored in the follow-up visits.<br>
          <br>
          Through compiled data, consumer market research, much trial
          and error,
          more recent methods use to whiten teeth have evolved so that
          years of
          staining can be removed with the right strength of whitening
          gels, and
          from the comfort of home. In 1989, when 10% strength carbamide
          peroxide
          gel was introduced and stone model teeth impressions were used
          to
          fabricate mouth trays. This method is very similar to what is
          used
          today for at home whitening kits but with much more advanced
          treatments
          to maximize results. Dentists have endorsed hydrogen peroxide
          or
          carbamide peroxide to be effective and safe.<br>
          <br>
          More and more companies began offering affordable products
          with the
          average consumer in mind so you won't have to worry about
          draining your
          bank account. However, not all companies are the same and
          there are
          many copycats.<br>
          <br>
          The best company would be one that offers its customers
          22%-44%
          strength carbamide peroxide treatments without a dentist
          visit, 44%
          works faster but is just as safe. At home whitening systems
          that are
          manufactured at a company's on site dental lab product custom
          fitted
          tray that are the same quality used by dentists, but at half
          the price.
          The whitening kits range somewhere between $80-$180, depending
          on which
          one you order. <br>
          <br>
          For 5,000 years people have been using some kind of teeth
          whitening and
          cleaning system although the process now is much more
          civilized and
          safer, and depending on your product of choice, is pain-free.
          It's hard
          to imagine a reason not to try it.<small><small><small>
