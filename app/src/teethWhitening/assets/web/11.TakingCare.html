          As millions of people all around the world know, sensitive
          teeth can make life in general a nightmare. Sensitive teeth
          comes with pain and discomfort that can make eating or
          drinking your favorite foods a painful experience. Although
          you may suffer from sensitive teeth, you can rest assured that
          they can be treated.<br>
          <br>
          Normally, this condition presents tooth pain after drinking
          cold liquid, eating hot or cold foods, or breathing cold air.
          If the pain becomes too much to bear, you should immediately
          see your dentist, as the nerve of your tooth could be exposed.
          Normally, sensitive teeth starts when the gums begin to pull
          away from the teeth. With the gums being a protective blanket,
          they cover and protect the teeth’s roots. When the gums recede
          and pull away, the roots have no protection, and therefore
          they will be exposed.<br>
          <br>
          The exposed root tips contain small tubules that lead directly
          to the nerves of the teeth. Whenever pressure, hot, or cold
          elements travel down the tubules, it will trigger the nerves
          and result in pain. Those who don’t have sensitive teeth will
          have their gums covering the tubules, which prevents these
          types of things from happening.<br>
          <br>
          The idea here is to stop tooth sensitivity and keep the gums
          healthy. If you reduce the pressure you use when brushing your
          teeth, you’ll find that your gums will remain healthy. When
          taught to brush their teeth, most people are instructed to use
          a lot of force. While this can get the teeth clean, it will
          also tear at the gums, which can lead to sensitive teeth. If
          you have sensitive teeth now, you should try using an electric
          toothbrush such as the Sonicare advanced.<br>
          <br>
          Although you may have sensitive teeth now, there are ways you
          can help to improve your gums and your teeth. There are
          several toothpastes out there on the market that contain
          potassium nitrate, which helps to reduce pain and discomfort
          associated with sensitivity. Although there are several
          toothpastes to choose from, Sensodyne is the preferred. It’s
          recommended by dentists as being the best, simply because it
          affects the nerve of the tooth and stops the pain where it
          starts.<br>
          <br>
          Mouthwash can also help tooth sensitivity, providing it
          contains fluoride. You can also ask your dentist which
          mouthwash he recommends, as there are several to choose from.
          Scope is a great brand to use, as it offers you plenty of
          fluoride without any alcohol. Unlike Listerine, Scope won’t
          burn your mouth when you use it. It will leave you with a
          clean feeling, and get your mouth and teeth completely clean -
          killing millions of bacteria.<br>
          <br>
          If you start using fluoride toothpaste such as Sensodyne and
          mouthwash, you’ll notice a bit improvement in your teeth and
          gums. The sensitivity will begin going away, giving you almost
          immediate relief. When you brush, make sure you brush gently,
          and avoid using any type of force, as it will always cause
          your gums to recede again.<br>
          <br>
          In the event that using Sensodyne and fluoride mouthwash
          doesn’t help, you should ask your dentist about other options
          available to you. Your dentist will know what will help you,
          so you shouldn’t hesitate to ask. Your dentist will know how
          to eliminate your sensitivity once and for all, and how to
          prevent it from coming back. Tooth sensitivity is something
          that many of us have to deal with - although there are ways
          that you can fight back and prevent the pain and discomfort
          associated with sensitivity from making your life harder than
          it has to be.<br>
