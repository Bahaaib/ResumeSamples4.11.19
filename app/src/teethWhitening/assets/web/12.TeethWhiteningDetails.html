          Whiter teeth are a staple in the health and beauty industry.
          Never would you see a model or celebrity with yellow or
          stained teeth. Let's face it, whiter teeth brings confidence.
          There are several ways for the average person to obtain a
          whiter and brighter smile, here are the most popular.<br>

          We will start out at the priciest end of the spectrum with
          professional whitening in dental office. Most dentists use a
          Carbamide Peroxide in the form of a gel and provide customized
          dental trays molded by plaster casts of your teeth. These
          trays reduce the risk of whitening lines due to the fact they
          are made just for you. In contrast, most at-home-kits provide
          the same Carbamide Peroxide, just not the form fitting tray.
          Dentists charge up to $600 for this treatment, mainly to cover
          time and office costs.<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          For a much cheaper price, we are able to obtain whiter teeth
          in the comfort of our own home by using at-home-kits. Most of
          these kits contain the same strength Carbamide Peroxide
          formula as your dentist or possibly a more powerful formula.
          Another benefit of at home whitening is the price. You're not
          paying a dentist or his employees, so you will find yourself
          paying hundreds less than you would at a dental office. Some
          quality kits can go as low as $39! The only real downside of
          an at home kit is the quality of the dental tray as it's
          typically a boil and bite mouthpiece. You may find these a
          little less comfortable than their dentistry counterpart.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          The results from whitening strips are usually less than
          desired. Major brands and off-brands have been known to
          disappoint, showing a mild effect over the course of a month.
          The problem is that most pharmaceutical backed companies are
          looking for a way to make a reoccurring profit from it's
          consumers. Thus keeping a weaker product on the shelves keep
          you coming back until desired results are acquired. In some
          cases this could be months or years.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Whitening toothpastes seem to have little or no effectiveness.
          I myself recently tested a popular toothpaste brand, known for
          it's supposed whitening power. I realized that at most, one
          line of past could only contain a mild active ingredient and
          you would have to brush your teeth for an hour for any
          noticeable result over a period of a month. Whitening
          toothpastes seem to be a marketing ploy that sells more from
          us being so eager for improvement.<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, the real contenders here are Dental and At home
          Whitening Kits. They will provide you with your desired
          results in the shortest amount of time. Saying that, at home
          whitening kits allow you to save hundreds of dollars and the
          peace and quiet of your own home... and no eerie dentist
          offices.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Safety With Teeth Whitening Products</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Before you decide to opt for a teeth whitening procedure you
          must be aware that only a few bleaching products meet ADA
          guidelines for safety and effectiveness.<br>
          <br>
          This is because only a few product manufacturers seek the
          ADA’s Seal of Acceptance. This is a voluntary program that
          requires a lot of expense and time so most manufacturers of
          teeth whitening products may choose to skip the procedure all
          together.<br>
          <br>
          However, you must realize that a teeth whitening product
          without the ADA’s Seal of Acceptance might also be safe to
          use.<br>
          <br>
          You can be assured, however, that products that do carry the
          seal are certified to be safe.<br>
          <br>
          Teeth whitening products that are dispensed through dentist’s
          offices are usually ADA compliant. Several whitening
          toothpastes that are freely available over-the-counter ADA
          compliant but other over-the-counter teeth whitening products
          are not certified by the ADA.<br>
          <br>
          To differentiate between the two types, check online websites
          and ask your local chemist for advice.<br>
          <br>
          Teeth whitening kits are not considered to be drugs and
          therefore they are not monitored by the ADA. Consider the
          following factors when selecting a teeth whitening kit.<br>
          <br>
          - Select a teeth whitening kit that allows you to mold the
          mouthpiece somewhat. These are more comfortable than others -
          Ask the opinion of others who have already tried the teeth
          whitening kit you are planning to buy<br>
          <br>
          - If you see that the color of your gums starts changing or if
          you detect an increase in teeth sensitivity, stop using the
          kit immediately. Then, consult a professional dentist.<br>
