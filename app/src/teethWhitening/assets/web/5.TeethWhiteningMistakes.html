          A lot of people are having their teeth whitened nowadays.
          That's great - you can never have too many reasons to feel
          good about yourself, especially in a recession, and tooth
          whitening has never been cheaper. It's very effective and is
          one of the few dental treatments that doesn't entail removing
          any tissue; there is no drilling and no need for injections.<br>
          <br>
          Great. But it's not as simple as you might think. You have to
          decide how to go about getting your teeth whitened, and it's
          easy to get it wrong. Here are the most common mistakes people
          make when they decide to whiten their teeth (Many dentists
          don't want you to know this stuff and it should be pretty
          clear which of the following points this refers to):<br>
          <br>
          1. The biggest mistake is to believe that spending more on
          so-called 'power' or 'laser' whitening you will get a better
          result.<br>
          <br>
          Not so. Power whitening also represents very poor value for
          money. Let's start with the cost. This procedure costs a lot
          because you have to be in the dental chair for up to an hour.
          Surgery time is money and dental practice overheads are high.
          Unfortunately, the results are often disappointing, with the
          teeth changing shade very little, changing patchily, or ending
          up with an unnatural chalky appearance. This does not reflect
          how well the procedure has been carried out; it's just
          unpredictable.<br>
          <br>
          The relapse rate is also alarmingly high. It should tell you
          something that the manufacturers of power whitening systems
          recommend you follow up with a home kit to 'stabilize' the
          result. What they fail to mention is that it's the home kit
          that does the work and you would get exactly the same result
          without the expensive 'power' or 'laser' stage. It just takes
          a day or two longer. The 'power' stage also increases the
          likelihood of the teeth becoming sensitive to temperature -
          sometimes severely so, and it can be quite painful in its own
          right.<br>
          <br>
          2. The second most costly mistake is to believe that all home
          whitening kits are the same. They aren't. Yes you can buy kits
          in the supermarket or in Boots but the strength of active gel
          that can be sold over the counter is strictly limited. A
          proprietary kit may cost a tenth of what you would pay for a
          professional version from a dentist, but you would probably
          have to fork out for a lot more than ten kits to get the same
          result - and it would take an awful lot longer to get there.
          Also, many over-the-counter products have not been evaluated
          for safety with prolonged usage. <br>
          <br>
          When you get a tooth whitening tray from your dentist it is
          accurately made to fit your mouth. This can never be the case
          with an off the shelf product, so there is an increased
          likelihood of gum irritation both from the tray itself and
          from gel leeching out onto the gums.<br>
          <br>
          3. Please don't be tempted to buy high-strength gel on the
          Internet. There are very good reasons for the over-the-counter
          restrictions and inappropriate use of some readily available
          products can be harmful to both hard tissues (teeth) and soft
          tissues (everything else, including gums, lips and skin). For
          example, some kits from less regulated countries are acidic.
          They initially make the teeth look whiter by etching the
          enamel - similar to opaque glass. This etching results in loss
          of tooth structure, leading to increased temperature
          sensitivity and susceptibility to decay. Dentists have likened
          buying whitening products on the Internet to 'scoring'
          prescription medication in an alley behind a night club. This
          is perhaps overstating the case, but you get my point.<br>
          <br>
          4. It's not very sensible to go to a beautician or to a gym to
          have your teeth whitened. The people there will reassure you
          that the procedure is safe so there's no need to pay
          professional prices. Well, it is safe - if you know what
          you're doing, if you know how to avoid or minimize
          side-effects, if nothing goes wrong and if you know how to
          deal with any complications that do occur.<br>
          <br>
          I've lost count of the number of people who have come to me to
          pick up the pieces following 'safe' bleaching by amateurs.
          After all, modern airliners can fly themselves these days -
          but I bet you'd want a qualified pilot sitting in the cockpit
          just in case. <br>
          <br>
          5. Don't expect whitening toothpastes to alter the overall
          shade of your teeth. These products are generally designed to
          remove surface stains and they are often quite effective at
          doing so - but they are unlikely to change the shade of
          unstained enamel.<br>
          <br>
          6. Another mistake is not to plan for how existing porcelain
          veneers, crowns, bridges and white fillings will look
          following whitening. These restorations will not lighten like
          your own teeth and may need to be replaced to prevent them
          appearing unacceptably dark afterwards. This needs to be
          planned for - before you begin whitening (and personally, I
          wouldn't recommend getting a beautician to draw up the
          treatment plan).<br>
          <br>
          7. Something else that has to be taken into account before you
          begin is that there are various types of discolouration and
          darkening of the teeth, caused by a number of different
          factors. These will not all respond to whitening in the same
          way. Some types will change very little, if at all.<br>
          <br>
          Spectacular results can be achieved but it is essential to
          have a professional examination to ascertain how best to
          obtain the smile you want before forking out any of your
          hard-earned money. To this end, many dentists offer a free,
          no-obligation preliminary consultation.<br>
          <br>
          8. Another thing people forget is that they may have to modify
          their lifestyle to minimize relapse. For example, if you rely
          on quick-fix power whitening, you will have to cut out tea,
          coffee, red wine, curries, all sorts of strongly coloured food
          and drink and smoking (which of course you should do anyway).<br>
          <br>
          With home kits this is less of an issue because you can treat
          yourself to a quick top-up at any time - usually for no extra
          cost.<br>
          <br>
          9. Remember to leave sufficient time to achieve the desired
          result. You can usually begin whitening within one week of
          your consultation, or sometimes on the same day, depending on
          what laboratory processes need to be carried out to fabricate
          the gel trays. Then, typically, it will take about two weeks
          of using the gel to reach the level of whiteness you desire
          (obviously, this varies from person to person. The speed of
          change is also governed by how frequently you use the product.
          If you only do it every second day, it will take longer - but
          you'll still get there. That's another advantage of the home
          system - you can tailor it to suit your lifestyle)<br>
          <br>
          10. Another mistake that people make, especially when using
          over-the-counter products, is that they don't go to see the
          hygienist before they begin whitening. If you have all surface
          stains and deposits removed first, the gel will be able to get
          at the enamel and will work much more quickly and effectively.<br>
          <br>
          So, if you want a bright, sparkly smile that will last and if
          you want to get it safely, comfortably, economically and with
          confidence that you are going about it the right way, please
          see a professional - and don't let them 'up-sell' you
          something you don't need.</big></big></p>
