          Myth 1 - Teeth Whitening ruins your tooth enamel<br>
          <br>
          Not generally true! Professional Teeth Whitening product
          suppliers
          mostly use Hydrogen Peroxide or Carbamide Peroxide as the
          active
          ingredients in their tooth whitener gels. The chemical
          Hydrogen
          Peroxide (HO) is a bleaching agent which converts into water
          (HO) and
          releases an Oxygen molecule (O) in the process of the chemical
          reaction. Both Water and Oxygen are common, safe components of
          our
          everyday lives.<br>
          <br>
          The Oxygen particles penetrate the rough surface of your tooth
          (even
          though they appear smooth, they are microscopically rough, rod
          like
          crystal structures) and dislodge staining particles. I like to
          explain
          this by imagining the TV commercials which show how a clothes
          washing
          powder with oxygen lifts stains from your clothing.<br>
          <br>
          The "bleach" Hydrogen Peroxide is not the same as household
          bleach
          containing ammonia, or other low-end, acid based tooth
          whitening
          products, and can be swallowed, within limits. In fact our own
          bodies
          produce Hydrogen Peroxide naturally!<br>
          <br>
          Acidic products can remove enamel from your teeth. Look for
          teeth
          whitening products using Hydrogen Peroxide which is pH
          balanced,
          meaning they have no, or low acidity levels. Putting acidity
          into
          perspective, you should be aware that everyday Orange Juice is
          shown in
          lab studies to soften (and potentially erode) tooth enamel by
          many
          times more than a professional hydrogen peroxide based tooth
          whitening
          gel could, if used correctly.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 2 - Teeth Whitening
            is not Safe</span><br>
          <br>
          Not true! Cosmetic Teeth Bleaching with Hydrogen Peroxide has
          been in
          use for 100 years. Most recognized dental bodies worldwide
          endorse
          tooth bleaching as a generally safe practice, when simple
          safety steps
          are followed. Any professional supplier of teeth whitening
          products
          will include adequate instructions for the safe use of their
          product.<br>
          <br>
          Safety vs Risk with tooth whitening is generally centred on 2
          main
          issues: Exposure of the gel to the gums and soft tissue of the
          mouth or
          lips, and tooth sensitivity. Both can be minimized by using
          professional products and minimizing the amount of time the
          bleaching
          gel is exposed to the gums or teeth.<br>
          <br>
          As with any cosmetic procedure, there are potential risks.
          Thankfully
          with professional teeth whitening any side effects experienced
          are
          temporary and are not permanent. As with most cosmetic
          procedures, you
          may have to endure some discomfort to look better. Sometimes I
          call
          this "Vain Pain".<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 3 - All whitening
            Gel is the same</span><br>
          <br>
          Not true! Of the two major professional gel options, there is
          Carbamide
          Peroxide and Hydrogen Peroxide. Both produce the same active
          ingredient
          Hydrogen Peroxide, but Carbamide Peroxide acts SLOWER on the
          teeth and
          is recommended for use only with an Accelerator Light (I will
          talk
          about that later) or for overnight use. Carbamide Peroxide
          concentrations contains roughly 1/3 of the active ingredient,
          Hydrogen
          Peroxide. As an example, 35% Carbamide Peroxide is roughly
          equal to 12%
          Hydrogen Peroxide.<br>
          <br>
          Because Hydrogen Peroxide is an unstable chemical which reacts
          immediately, it is more expensive to produce. Many vendors
          offer only
          Carbamide Peroxide based products as a result. Stabilized
          Hydrogen
          Peroxide, while the most difficult and expensive to produce,
          reacts
          immediately on contact with the teeth and is best suited for
          short
          duration tooth whitening treatments without an accelerator
          light.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 4 - Teeth Whitening
            Accelerator Lights don't work</span><br>
          <br>
          Not generally true! Except in some cases. There are businesses
          who sell
          only take home teeth whitening kits, and some Dentists, who
          say that
          the LED Lights and other accelerator lights are just a gimmick
          and
          don't work.<br>
          <br>
          There have been many studies conducted which show that the use
          of a
          professional accelerator light does indeed accelerate the
          oxidization
          (the release of oxygen and chemical bleaching reaction) of
          tooth
          whitener gel. This is especially true with Carbamide Peroxide
          based
          whitening gels which react much slower chemically.<br>
          <br>
          Ask yourself, how many Dentists and Cosmetic Dentistry
          businesses offer
          an "in-office", "chairside", "instant whitening" or "Power
          Whitening"
          treatment? Many of them! Now why would they offer this
          treatment if the
          accelerator lights did not work? From my own professional
          experience,
          there is no doubt that the professional quality Blue LED
          Accelerator
          lights enable a faster tooth whitening result when using
          Carbamide
          Peroxide gel. In our own studies and observations having
          worked with
          thousands of clients and compared the results with the same
          gel, over
          the same time period, with and without the LED Accelerator
          Lamp, we are
          sure there is a noticeable improvement with the light under
          these
          conditions.<br>
          <br>
          But, not all Accelerator Lights are the same. Some Dentists
          use older
          technology lamps such as Plasma, UV and other technologies.
          These
          technologies function at a light spectrum which is known to
          cause
          heating or burning of the skin tissue and heating of the tooth
          surface
          to release the oxygen in the gel, unfortunately that can also
          mean UV
          damage to your mouth, gums and lips. There are also mini
          handheld LED
          Lights you often see in TV Commercials - these are only toys
          and do not
          have enough power to have any effect.<br>
          <br>
          Another case of where an accelerator light doesn't work well
          is if the
          provider uses a mouth tray to hold the gel against the teeth,
          and this
          tray is coloured, is a "Silicone Impression" tray, or is a
          Pre-Filled
          Foam tray. These types of mouthguard trays do not allow the
          light
          frequency to pass through them and there are no accelerated
          bleaching
          effects as a result.<br>
          <br>
          Modern, professional teeth whitening accelerator lamps all use
          LED
          light in the blue light spectrum, at a specific frequency
          which excites
          the oxygen release from the chemical, and accelerates the
          tooth
          whitening process. They are often known as "Cool LED" or
          "cold" light
          accelerators because they do not heat the teeth or surrounding
          tissue.
          As a result, they are perfectly safe, and the technology is
          FDA
          Apparoved.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 5 - You need to go
            to a Dentist to get professional whitening
            results</span><br>
          <br>
          Not true! Today, you can buy in Australia, professional
          strength tooth
          whitening products which you can use at home or as a service
          with a
          professional accelerator light and assistance - and not just
          from the
          Dentist.<br>
          <br>
          Dentists are exclusively allowed to use the VERY STRONG
          bleaching gels,
          over 16% Hydrogen Peroxide, and up to 35% Hydrogen Peroxide.
          At these
          strengths of whitening gel, the real risks are tooth
          sensitivity and
          gum trauma. Dentists therefore use a special gum barrier which
          they
          apply to your gums prior to applying the strong gels. A
          Dentist will
          usually get a better whitening result in the same amount of
          time as a
          non-dental treatment, but there are costs to consider, both
          financially
          and in increased tooth sensitivity when using the stronger
          Dentist-only
          treatments.<br>
          <br>
          For many years the Dentist's had the cosmetic teeth whitening
          market
          monopolized because professional teeth whitening technology
          was too
          expensive for anyone else. Today, the price and availability
          of
          professional tooth whitening products means you have many more
          choices
          and options.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 6 - Teeth Bleaching
            Gels from anywhere other than USA, Australia
            or UK are unsafe</span><br>
          <br>
          Not true! First of all, in this modern world, you may not even
          know it
          but products appearing to be manufactured by a good American
          or
          Australian brand are most likely actually manufactured in
          China. This
          is true with all types of products and technology worldwide,
          due to
          simple economics.<br>
          <br>
          There are many brands of teeth whitening products available in
          the
          market. You don't need to be concerned where they were
          manufactured,
          because it makes NO DIFFERENCE. The active chemical, Hydrogen
          Peroxide
          is the same the world over. Because Hydrogen Peroxide is also
          used as a
          disinfectant, bacteria can't live in this chemical and it will
          always
          be safe (ie; germ and bacteria free) to put Hydrogen Peroxide
          based gel
          into your mouth regardless of where it came from or how it was
          manufactured.<br>
          <br>
          If the Hydrogen Peroxide gel is past its use by date or
          chemically
          expired, you will know right away, because the gel turns a
          milky white
          colour which shows that it is already oxidized and will no
          longer be
          effective at whitening your teeth, it won't cause any harm.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 7 - You need
            customized Mouthguard trays to get best whitening
            results</span><br>
          <br>
          Not true! While Dentists offer custom mouth trays which costs
          a lot of
          money, there are also many home whitening kits providing the
          boil-n-bite thermoshrinking mouthguards which will work
          equally as
          well. The totally custom trays may be a little more
          comfortable to
          wear, but they need to be, because in general, a Dentist's
          at-home
          teeth whitening kits require you to have the tray in your
          mouth for
          long periods of time, over weeks of use. There are non-dentist
          products
          which only require short time duration usage, so it doesn't
          matter as
          much if the mouthguard is less comfortable.<br>
          <br>
          The other problem with mouthguards which are too form-fitted
          is that
          the gap between the teeth and the surface of the mouthguard is
          so
          small, that only the thinnest layer of whitening gel can fit
          between.
          The problem with this is less chemical = less whitening
          result, so you
          need to use the mouthguard and gel more frequently, over
          longer periods
          of time to get a good result.<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 8 - All teeth are
            the same and whitening results should be like
            the "Hollywood" smile</span><br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, some people have unrealistic expectations and
          can be
          disappointed with their teeth whitening results. This is not
          because
          professional teeth whitening products don't work, because they
          ALWAYS
          WORK to some degree. It's because they fail to understand that
          each
          person's teeth are unique in mineral composition, which means
          that
          tooth bleaching will produce a different result for each
          person. If
          your teeth are genetically more yellow than someone else, your
          results
          will not be as white, no matter who's product you use, how
          many times
          you try to whiten your teeth, or what the strength of the gel
          is. And
          some people have deep staining from antibiotics, tetracycline
          etc.
          which can't be easily removed and may never be fully removed.
          Also,
          there are people with genetically grey or blue tinted teeth
          for which
          Hydrogen Peroxide bleaching does not work as well as yellow or
          brown
          colour tints.<br>
          <br>
          People see the Hollywood Stars on TV and in Movies and believe
          they can
          get their teeth bleached to look like the movie stars.
          Unfortunately,
          that is not possible. Chemical Teeth Whitening has its limits
          of
          effectiveness and will not produce the pure white colour (for
          most
          people) you see on Movie Stars. Does that mean that movie
          stars are
          just genetically lucky? No, it means that movie stars have
          often paid
          many thousands of dollars for Porcelain Veneers to straighten
          their
          teeth and make them pure white. Of course you have this option
          too, if
          you have the money, but a tooth whitening with Hydrogen
          Peroxide
          generally makes a noticeable difference in whiteness and
          brightness of
          natural teeth, at a much lower cost than Veneers.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Myth 9 - If I have Caps,
            Crowns, Veneers or Dentures so I can't whiten
            my teeth</span><br>
          <br>
          Not true! While Hydrogen Peroxide only whitens natural teeth,
          it also
          cleans all surfaces, including man-made surfaces of caps,
          crowns,
          veneers and dentures. Some dentists say that hydrogen peroxide
          can
          weaken the bond of some of these artificial substances, or
          attack the
          metal components, but you should check with your Dentist about
          your
          specific case before whitening your natural teeth if you are
          concerned.<br>
          <br>
          It is always better to whiten your natural teeth FIRST if you
          are going
          to be getting any caps, crowns etc. fitted. This is because
          the dentist
          can then match the colour of the artificial substance to your
          now
          whiter, natural teeth, giving an overall whiter smile.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Common Questions and
            Answers about Teeth Whitening:</span><br style="font-weight:
            bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Does Whitening Toothpaste
            work?</span><br>
          <br>
          The problem here is that there is not a strong enough
          concentration of
          any chemical, and it is not concentrated on your teeth long
          enough to
          make ANY noticeable difference to the whiteness of your teeth.
          The only
          real "whiteness" if you can call it that, which is created by
          toothpaste is actually the abrasive action of the toothbrush
          or paste
          against your tooth enamel. This scratching DOES wear down
          tooth enamel
          and also removes large chunks of staining material on the
          tooth
          surface, but not the tiny staining particles which make teeth
          look more
          yellow. This is the same thing with "Tooth Polishes" which
          only act
          like a fine sandpaper to remove tooth enamel while brushing
          and will
          cause increased tooth sensitivity with prolonged use tooth
          enamel thins.<br>
          <br>
          As with the Risk vs Reward argument, while there is
          significant damage
          caused to tooth enamel from tooth brushing over time, on
          balance this
          is better than the consequences of not cleaning your teeth.<br>
          <br>
          Don't be fooled by those expensive "whitening toothpastes" -
          they do
          not make a noticeable difference to the whiteness of your
          teeth, they
          are abrasively removing enamel from your teeth and you're
          better off
          spending your money on something that does work.<br>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Aside
          from these conditions, teeth whitening is not advisable for
          people with Dental Braces, people with gum disease, open
          cavities,
          leaking fillings, recent oral surgery, or other dental
          conditions. If
          in doubt, I recommend you visit your Dentist prior to using a
          professional strength teeth whitening product.<br>
          <br>
          People with grey or blue tint colour to their natural teeth
          may also
          not benefit as greatly from teeth whitening using Hydrogen
          Peroxide, as
          people with yellow or brown tint colour.<br>
          <br>
          If you have Gingivitis or Periodontal disease, any Hydrogen
          Peroxide
          bleach on your gum line will be painful and may produce a
          small amount
          of bleeding at the gum line. As a result, I don't recommend
          whitening
          your teeth until these issues are under control with your
          Dentist. What
          is interesting however, is that reports have shown that
          Hydrogen
          Peroxide can kill the bacteria which causes Gingivitis,
          possibly
          preventing further damage.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">What are the Risks with
            Teeth Whitening?</span><br>
          <br>
          Whitening treatments are generally safe, however, some of the
          potential
          complications of these treatments include:<br>
          <br>
          GUM IRRITATION: Whitening gel that comes in contact with gum
          tissue
          during the treatment may cause inflammation and/or blanching
          or
          whitening of the gums, gum line or inside lips. This is due to
          inadvertent exposure of small areas of those tissues to the
          whitening
          gel. The inflammation and/or whitening of gums is transient,
          meaning it
          does not last, and any colour change of the gum tissue will
          reverse
          within two hours, usually within 10-30 minutes. Persons with a
          history
          of mouth ulcers may develop temporary mouth ulcers which
          usually
          disappear within a few days after treatment.<br>
          <br>
          TOOTH SENSITIVITY: Although more common with the in-Office
          Dentist
          Treatments using very strong bleaching gels, some people can
          experience
          some tooth sensitivity for a period after the whitening
          treatment.
          People with existing sensitivity, recently cracked teeth,
          micro-cracks,
          open cavities, leaking fillings, or other dental conditions
          that cause
          sensitivity may find that those conditions increase or prolong
          tooth
          sensitivity after a cosmetic teeth whitening treatment.<br>
          <br>
          SPOTS OR STREAKS: Some people may develop white spots or
          streaks on
          their teeth due to calcium deposits that naturally occur in
          teeth.
          These usually diminish within 24 hours.<br>
          <br>
          RELAPSE: After a cosmetic teeth whitening treatment, it is
          natural for
          teeth colour to regress somewhat over time. This is natural
          and should
          be very gradual, but it can be accelerated by exposing your
          teeth to
          various staining agents, such as coffee, tea, tobacco, red
          wine, etc.
          You should not eat or drink anything except water during the
          first 60
          minutes after a teeth whitening treatment, and avoid tooth
          staining
          agents for 24 hours after (eat and drink white or clear
          coloured foods
          during this time).The results of a Hydrogen Peroxide based
          tooth
          bleaching treatment are not intended to be permanent, and can
          last up
          to 2 years when using professional strength treatments.
          Secondary,
          repeat, or touch-up treatments may be needed to achieve or
          maintain the
          colour you desire for your teeth.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">How do I achieve best
            teeth whitening results?</span><br>
          <br>
          Before answering this question, you should be thinking of the
          tooth
          whitening results from a single treatment, as a trade-off
          against the
          potential side-effects of a single treatment. The best answer
          is
          balance! Balance the potential results with the potential risk
          of
          side-effects. The highest concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide
          produce
          the best results in the shortest time, but also have the
          highest
          potential side-effects. My recommendation is middle of the
          road - not
          the strongest, and not the weakest to get a happy balance of
          results
          and risk.<br>
          <br>
          Before you undertake a professional teeth whitening treatment,
          have
          your teeth cleaned professionally. At least in the smile area,
          which is
          the upper and lower 8-10 front teeth. REMEMBER, teeth are
          opaque so
          cleaning the BACK of the teeth is very important to the
          overall
          whitening results you will achieve. A Dental Cleaning will
          remove any
          excess materials stuck to the outside of your teeth and permit
          the
          Hydrogen Peroxide to work best at bleaching your natural
          teeth, evenly.<br>
          <br>
          Use a professional strength teeth whitening gel. Many
          Pharmacies, TV
          Ads and Internet companies promote teeth whitening products
          which use
          3% or 6% Hydrogen Peroxide concentration. These just don't
          work well at
          whitening teeth, and any effect they have takes a LONG time to
          achieve.
          The comparative cost difference is not that great between
          these low-end
          products and products of professional strength, but the time
          and effort
          required is. I recommend 12% Hydrogen Peroxide if available in
          your
          area, unless you are using a whitening treatment with a
          professional
          accelerator light which can use 35% Carbamide Peroxide. Of
          course the
          Dentist in-Office power whitening treatments generally use gel
          much
          stronger than 12%, but beware of the potential side effects.<br>
          <br>
          Remember, if your teeth aren't as white as you would like
          after the
          first treatment, you can always allow some time to monitor
          your gums
          and teeth for any side-effects, then take an additional
          treatment(s).
          Provided the product you are using is not too expensive, this
          is the
          best and safest way to achieve optimal teeth whitening
          results.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">How long does Teeth
            Whitening last?</span><br>
          <br>
          This depends on the product you use to whiten your teeth, and
          the
          lifestyle you lead.<br>
          <br>
          If you are a smoker, or regularly drink red wine or use any
          other
          heavily coloured substances regularly, your whiter teeth will
          become
          stained again more quickly.<br>
          <br>
          There is no absolute answer to this question, but in general,
          if you
          use a professional teeth whitening product for the full
          treatment as
          recommended, you may be able to keep the whiter teeth for up
          to 2 years
          if you are conscious of what you eat and drink, and maintain
          your teeth
          and oral health properly.<br>
          <br>
          Most people are not saints and lead lives where they enjoy red
          wine or
          a curry etc. That's fine, but if you want to keep your whiter
          teeth you
          should brush them 60 minutes after you have consumed the food
          or drink.
          Research suggests you should not brush immediately after
          eating because
          the acid formed in your mouth when eating makes the tooth
          enamel softer
          and abrasive brushing of the teeth during this period can be
          detrimental.<br>
          <br>
          I also recommend the use of Teeth Whitening Pens. They apply a
          thin
          layer of Hydrogen Peroxide to the teeth, at any time or place,
          and will
          bleach any staining close to the tooth surface (if the
          concentration is
          strong enough). Whitening Pens active ingredient only works
          for 30 to
          60 seconds on the teeth because saliva washes it away, so
          choose a
          Whitening Pen which uses Hydrogen Peroxide (not Carbamide) and
          is
          professional strength gel. Whitening Pens are generally not
          suitable
          for removing deeper stains.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">I have tooth sensitivity
            problems, can I still whiten my teeth?</span><br>
          <br>
          Yes, and you have several options. You could use a
          desensitizing tooth
          paste for approximately 1 month prior to whitening your teeth
          and if
          sensitivity is reduced, you can use any product. But be aware
          that your
          sensitivity will likely increase again during or after the
          treatment,
          so I suggest choosing a mid strength whitening gel where you
          can remove
          it quickly if discomfort gets unbearable.<br>
          <br>
          The other option is a low strength whitening gel. This will
          work over a
          longer period of time, but sometimes also increases
          sensitivity because
          of the amount of time required on the teeth to get a good
          result.<br>
          <br>
          Probably the best option, in my opinion, is a Teeth Whitening
          Pen of at
          least 12% Hydrogen Peroxide concentration. Because you can
          paint the
          gel onto specific teeth and because the gel is washed away by
          saliva in
          less than a minute, this may produce the best results, with
          the least
          discomfort.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">The simple rule to the
            best Teeth Whitening results</span><br>
          <br>
          Concentration of Hydrogen Peroxide (Strength) + Time on the
          teeth
          (Time) = Results (Effectiveness)<br>
          <br>
          When factoring in Time, you should also consider the
          consequences of
          time:<br>
          <br>
          * More effort, meaning you may not complete the full treatment<br>
          <br>
          * More inconvenience<br>
          <br>
          * Enough active ingredient to chemically react over that time
          period.
          That is to say, just leaving any whitening gel on your teeth
          for 24
          consecutive hours won't help because the Hydrogen Peroxide
          normally is
          fully reacted and spent within 20 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          * Longer exposure of the mouthguard to the gums. Friction of
          the
          mouthguard can often cause gum irritation<br>
          <br>
          * Longer exposure of the bleaching gel to the gums. Once
          again, the
          risk of gum irritation.<br>
          <br>
          * Remember, there are limits to the whiteness achievable with
          natural
          teeth and these will vary with your tooth genetics, your
          lifestyle and
          the state of your teeth at the time of whitening.<br>
