        Pearly white teeth make a person’s smile attractive. But if
        yours are discolored you may hesitate on flashing your smile.
        Thankfully, that can now be solved with teeth-whitening
        treatments. You
        can choose among many different ways in achieving that perfect
        smile.
        For one, you can decide to opt for a professional teeth
        whitening
        treatment or use drugstore solutions.<br>

          </big>But is one better than the other?<br>
          <br>
          Decide on the procedure you want while taking into
          consideration, the
          severity of your teeth discoloration, amount you are willing
          to spend,
          and the results you want. Yellowish teeth will probably
          lighten more
          than brownish or grayish ones. Here’s how to choose the right
          tooth-whitening treatment for you.<br>
          <br>
          Option No. 1: Laser Bleaching at the Dentist's Office. With
          laser
          bleaching, the gum tissue is protected then a strong bleach is
          applied
          your teeth. The bleach is activated with the use of a laser
          light to
          make it work. . The bleach used in this treatment is a
          stronger
          solution than the one you can use at home wherein you don’t
          have a dentist’s assistance and your gums are left
          unprotected. This treatment consists of three bleaching
          treatments that
          each takes 20 minutes so you can have your desired bright
          smile within
          an hour. Of all teeth-whitening options, the laser bleaching
          costs the
          most.<br>
          <br>
          Option No. 2: Professional Bleaching Trays. Your dentist may
          also offer
          a treatment using bleaching trays wherein bleaching trays that
          perfectly fit your teeth will be fashioned out of the
          impression of
          your teeth. You will use a special bleaching solution in these
          trays
          every day at home for a week or two. When the discoloration is
          really
          bad or the results you want are more dramatic, you can use
          bleaching
          trays after getting your laser bleaching treatment.<br>
          <br>
          Option No. 3: Over-The-Counter Teeth-Whitening Kits. There are
          many
          types of teeth-whitening products that you can buy in
          drugstores. Kits
          to make your own trays, gels, swabs, strips, paints are now
          available.
          Strips seem to be the best choice because you're less likely
          to swallow
          bleach or harm your gums with them. These over-the-counter
          solutions
          are not strong enough for severe discoloration but they can be
          used by
          people minor discoloration especially among young ones with
          their
          enamel still strong and less susceptible to staining.<br>
          <br>
          Before finally getting that decision and undergoing a
          teeth-whitening
          treatment, take these into consideration. First there’s the
          cost which should be well-suited to your budget. These days,
          the cost
          of professional teeth-whitening treatments depends on the
          option you
          choose but they usually cost $500 to $1,200. On the other
          hand, the
          price of at-home kits ranges from $15 to $50. <br>
          <br>
          You should also consider the post-teeth whitening maintenance.
          <br>
          <br>
          As it is, results from teeth-whitening treatments are not for
          life, and
          those who get them need to get touch-ups once in a while.
          Results for
          in-office bleaching can last up to a year, at-home
          professional
          whitening trays last 6 to 12 months, and 3-6 months for
          over-the-counter whitening products. The lifestyle of the
          person also
          can affect the duration of results. Your results will fade
          faster if
          you smoke and regularly consume food and drinks that can stain
          teeth,
          such as coffee, tea, and blueberries. So if drink coffee three
          times a
          day, you have to visit the dentist in six months for a
          touch-up. You
          can go one to two years between treatments without touch-ups
          if you
          avoid the mentioned habits and brush your teeth regularly.<br>
          <br>
          Another important thing to consider would be the risks teeth
          whitening
          could render to your overall dental health. The process is
          known to make teeth sensitive to hot and cold afterwards. It
          usually
          doesn’t last long but it can be quite uncomfortable. Thee
          gums and other soft tissues inside your mouth can also be
          harmed by the
          bleach, causing mouth sores and discomfort, so you must make
          sure that
          the bleaching material do not touch these tissues. <br>
          <br>
          To fully understand such considerations, discuss with your
          dentist the
          condition of your teeth so you could get the best advice.
          Apart from
          that, you can consult on which treatment to choose without
          compromising
          your dental health.<br>
