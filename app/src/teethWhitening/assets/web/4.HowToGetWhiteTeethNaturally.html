    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Before
          I tell you how to get white teeth naturally, its important
          that
          you know some background information about your teeth. Our
          teeth are
          ordinarily covered with enamel, which is considered one of the
          hardest
          natural substances on earth. It is so strong, in fact, that it
          can
          protect your teeth from trauma and is resistant to acids. Over
          time,
          our enamel slowly erodes away, making it thinner and allowing
          the
          natural color of dentin, which is yellow, to be seen through.
          Dentin is
          found underneath the enamel. It is what comprises the tooth's
          core.<br>
          <br>
          Tooth discoloration can be classified into two types,
          according to the
          location. The first type is an intrinsic discoloration, which
          forms on
          the core of the tooth. Among the things that can cause
          intrinsic tooth
          discoloration are aging, exposure to medications, or excessive
          fluoride
          during infancy and childhood, when the teeth are forming. On
          the other
          hand, extrinsic tooth discolorations affect the surface of the
          tooth,
          and may be caused by staining beverages such as coffee, tea,
          or wine,
          certain foods, and smoking tobacco.<br>
          <br>
          Discussed below are the causes of tooth discoloration, in more
          detail.<br>
          <br>
          Aging: As previously described, the tooth's enamel tends to
          wear out as
          time passes by, allowing the yellow dentin to be seen through.
          Also,
          stains from foods and beverages ingested accumulate with age.<br>
          <br>
          Genetics: There are just some people lucky to be born with
          thick white
          enamel. Don't blame your parents though; it wasn't their fault
          they
          were born that way too.<br>
          <br>
          Dietary habits: As mentioned above, there are some foods and
          beverages
          known to be staining agents for your teeth. Among these are
          coffee,
          tea, cola, and red wine. Additionally, vinegar and some citrus
          fruits
          like oranges and lemons can cause your enamel to erode, as
          these are
          somewhat acidic.<br>
          <br>
          Drugs: Some medications, when taken during the period of tooth
          formation, can cause staining. Some examples are Tetracycline,
          an
          antibiotic, and Benadryl, an antihistamine. These types of
          stains are
          permanent and cannot be removed.<br>
          <br>
          Trauma: Accidents and injuries can cause cracks in your teeth,
          allowing
          dirt and debris to accumulate.<br>
          <br>
          Poor oral hygiene: Plaque builds up when we don't brush and
          floss our
          teeth properly and regularly. Accumulated plaque can cause
          tooth
          discoloration.<br>
          <br>
          Many of us may have discoloured or stained teeth due to one or
          a
          combination of these factors. We cannot simply refuse to age,
          or stay
          away from certain foods and drinks forever, but we also do
          want a
          healthy-looking dazzling white smile. The good thing is that
          teeth
          whitening is becoming more popular these days. But wait, not
          every one
          of us can afford to have our teeth whitened professionally by
          dentists.
          Professional whitening can cost so much, and most of us simply
          don't
          have the luxury of a hefty bank account. Why not try some of
          these
          inexpensive, tried-and-tested home remedies?<br>
          <br>
          Baking soda: Used alone or with toothpaste to spice up the
          flavor,
          baking soda is an effective teeth whitener. Also, it gets rid
          of bad
          breath.<br>
          <br>
          Hydrogen peroxide: You can buy this cheap at your local
          drugstores. You
          can gargle it, but remember never to swallow it. You may
          experience a
          slight stinging sensation, but you can be sure that it's
          working to
          cleanse your mouth. Another method to apply this is to dip a
          cotton bud
          into a solution of hydrogen peroxide and gently rub it against
          the
          surface of your teeth. Don't forget to rinse afterwards with
          water.<br>
          <br>
          Strawberries: Not many people know this, but strawberry seeds
          have
          natural teeth cleansing properties. You can rub them directly
          onto your
          teeth, or you can mash them to make a paste. After
          application, brush
          your teeth with your usual toothpaste, as strawberries have a
          high
          content of fructose which can cause tooth decay.<br>
          <br>
          Wood ash: This contains potassium hydroxide, a bleaching
          agent. But be
          careful not to rub your teeth too vigorously or use it too
          frequently
          as this can cause your enamel to erode. You can use this alone
          or with
          a little bit of toothpaste.<br>
          <br>
          Home-made toothpaste: You can make your own home-made
          toothpaste using
          ingredients that can normally be found in your home. Take some
          baking
          soda, salt, a bit of hydrogen peroxide, and a small amount of
          toothpaste and mix them all together to make your own special
          whitening
          toothpaste.<br>
          <br>
          There are also some herbal remedies to help whiten your teeth.<br>
          <br>
          Babul: The tanning found in this tree is useful for whitening
          the teeth.<br>
          <br>
          Margosa or neem: Neem oil, aside from being an effective teeth
          whitener, works against bad breath as well. It has antiseptic
          properties, and can thus help fight bacteria and prevent
          cavities.<br>
          <br>
          Bayan aerial roots: The roots are known to be an effective
          astringent.
          It can also make your gums healthier.<br>
          <br>
          Basil: Dried basil leaves, crushed into a powder form, can be
          used for
          brushing the teeth. Aside from whitening your teeth, it can
          also help
          strengthen your gums and make them more resistant against
          bleeding.<br>
          <br>
          There are many other natural methods to whiten your teeth,
          including
          walnut bark, apple-cider vinegar, and orange peels. A healthy
          diet that
          includes fresh vegetables also helps in whitening the teeth
          and
          maintaining your over-all health.<br>
          <br>
          There are some people who just cannot avoid drinking coffee,
          chocolate,
          or other foods and beverages known to cause teeth staining.
          For these
          addicts, this can be remedied by drinking plenty of water
          after
          consuming those types of foods and drinks. Drinking water can
          keep the
          stains from building up. Additionally, you can chew on a piece
          of
          sugarless gum. This also helps to prevent teeth staining.<br>
          <br>
          As we have been taught since we were children, we should brush
          our
          teeth three times a day, once after every meal. But this is
          not always
          possible for many of us. During those times when you simply
          are unable
          to brush your teeth, rinsing your mouth with water will do for
          the
          meantime.<br>
          <br>
          Also, keep in mind that the element calcium, which is
          responsible for
          making our teeth strong and durable, is naturally yellow. This
          means
          that we can't have purely white teeth, because this means that
          we would
          have to deplete our teeth of calcium. This is a useful thing
          to
          remember for those overzealous fanatics who are obsessed with
          whitening
          their teeth.<br>
          <br>
          If you are considering undergoing a professional teeth
          whitening
          procedure, you must know about its potential side effects.
          This
          includes loss of enamel, teeth translucence, and increased
          sensitivity
          to heat and cold. Not to mention it can cost you a small
          fortune. Why
          go for the more expensive and riskier option, when there is a
          cheaper
          and safer alternative? Try these natural home remedies, they
          might just
          work for you.</big></big></p>
