            dreams of having white teeth - the kind of teeth that
            brightens a smile! In this generation we live in, that is
            not a hard feat at all. Modern technology and innovations in
            dentistry has allowed us easy and accessible ways to wow the
            world with a bright, white smile. There are many tooth
            whitening products and/or procedures that are available for
            anyone who wish to achieve whiter teeth. These products vary
            in prices, making them budget-friendly to those who want to
            make their teeth look better but do not have much money to
            spend for it. <br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Of course, the effectiveness of the product or procedure may
            vary with the cost, but it doesn't mean that cheaper ones
            are not effective at all. With all these tooth-whitening
            options available, however, regular tooth brushing and
            flossing still remains to be the top means of achieving
            healthy and clean teeth.<br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Here are several tooth whitening methods.<br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Chewing gums. These are not your regular chewing gums for
            they are especially made to whiten teeth. These gums contain
            bicarb soda, a common ingredient in tooth-whitening tooth
            pastes. Whitening gums, however, do not contain any
            bleaching agents, which is a usual substance found in most
            effective tooth whitening systems. All you have to do is
            chew a gum four times a day for 20 minutes. It often takes
            about four weeks before any sign of effect appears.<br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Toothpaste. These whitening products are easy to access.
            They can be bought over-the-counter. They look like regular
            tooth pastes and used like regular tooth pastes but they are
            slightly more expensive due to their claims teeth-whitening
            effects. Dentists, however, argue that these tooth-whitening
            pastes are only as good as regular tooth pastes and do not
            have any teeth whitening capabilities. Frequent brushing
            (more than twice a day) may do more harm than good to a
            person's teeth.<br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Teeth whitening strips. These whitening products are also
            sold over the counter like whitening pastes. They contain a
            low concentration of peroxide, about 6 to 15%, which is a
            bleaching agent. The strips are worn in the mouth for an
            hour, once or twice a day, within a certain number of days.
            <br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Teeth whitening strips come in different brands which may
            vary in results. Regular use of whitening strips can make
            the teeth look three times brighter than before. Many people
            opt to use these strips to whiten their teeth because it is
            a good and budget-friendly option. It is also a comfort to
            wear, with only slight discomfort when it is worn while
            talking.<br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Teeth whitening trays. These trays are worn in the mouth
            together with a whitening gel several times a day, for a
            specific amount of time. The gel contains 10 to 15%
            concentration of the bleaching agent, carbamide peroxide. It
            is available in one-size-fits-all or custom sizes. This
            method is quite effective in whitening the teeth, but it is
            observed that the one-size-fits-all trays are less
            successful in delivering desired results due to improper
            tooth-gel contact.<br>
          </font> <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            In office tooth whitening. This method of teeth whitening is
            also called laser teeth whitening. It is the most sought
            after and most effective of them all. It is a procedure
            performed by a dental professional that promises almost
            immediate effects. The procedure involves cleaning the mouth
            before applying a protective gel in it. Another special gel
            that contains peroxide is applied to teeth. To activate the
            bleaching gel, a special kind of light is used. The gel,
            activated by the light, penetrates the tooth enamel and
            beaches it in order to turn the teeth white. This procedure
            may have side effects, but they go away few days after the
            procedure has been performed.<br>
