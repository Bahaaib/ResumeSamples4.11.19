          A lot of people desire to have a brilliant smile with shiny
          and sparkling bright teeth. To achieve it, they consume lots
          of money on teeth whitening products. Teeth bleaching is just
          one of the few teeth whitening treatments.<br>
          <br>
          Bleaching is an excellent teeth whitening treatment. It is the
          most widely known treatment for whitening teeth because it is
          cheaper compared to laser treatment. The treatment is done
          without taking away any of the tooth surface.<br>
          <br>
          Each of us has distinct tooth color. Naturally, a lot of
          smokers have stained teeth.. But others are blessed with
          pearly white teeth.<br>
          <br>
          Typically teeth bleaching is suited for those who have
          discolored teeth like smokers and those who are eating but
          fail to brush properly. It is recommended that you seek an
          advice to a dentist before applying these teeth whitening
          product.<br>
          <br>
          Dentist will tell you if it's appropriate for you to undergo a
          teeth whitening treatment and will recommend it if you are.
          First the dentist will apply a gel or rubber shield on gums so
          that the soft tissue will not be damaged. Then they will apply
          the bleaching product to the teeth by means of a tray which
          will fit the shape of your mouth. After this the dentist would
          just give you some instructions and you'll continue the
          treatment at home.<br>
          <br>
          The active ingredients of bleaching products such as carbamide
          peroxide or hydrogen peroxide makes the teeth white. When the
          active ingredient starts to break, the oxygen goes inside the
          enamel of the teeth and then the tooth color made lighter.
          Treatments like this are usually done in three to four weeks.<br>
          <br>
          There are new products that can be applied for eight hours at
          a time. You can perform the treatment when it is time for you
          to sleep. The result can be achieved for at least one week
          only.<br>
          <br>
          You still have another option for whitening your teeth which
          is laser teeth whitening. In laser teeth whitening a rubber
          dam will be placed over the teeth so as to shield the gums
          from being damaged, and then a whitening product is applied to
          your teeth. A laser is used to trigger the chemical applied to
          the teeth. It boosts the chemical effect of the bleaching
          product so that the change of color can be achieved quickly.<br>
          <br>
          The dentist needs to check your teeth to ensure that you're
          suitable to undergo the treatment. It is the fastest procedure
          that may only take for about an hour.<br>
          <br>
          The effects of bleaching teeth can last up to three years and
          may differ from one person to another. Of course if you keep
          on smoking and drink or eat products that can stain your teeth
          the effect is less likely to last long. During or after the
          treatment you'll fell your teeth become sensitive to cold. But
          these symptoms are usually disappears within a few days after
          the treatment is done.<br>
          <br>
          There are lots of whitening teeth products that are made
          available. These are effective in removing stain and enhance
          the entire appearance of your teeth but it would not affect
          the natural color of your teeth. Once your teeth undergo a
          whitening treatment, a whitening paste can be helpful to make
          the effect last longer.<br>
          <br>
          There are many ways to keep your teeth white. Try cutting down
          the amount of food that you eat or drink that causes a stain
          or discoloration of your teeth. Also stop smoking and make a
          habit to brush your teeth three times a day to prevent
          staining or discoloring of your teeth.<br>

          are plenty of methods to achieve this. Here are some good
          teeth whitening tips that you can fallow:<br>
          <br>
          - there are many teeth whitening methods that you can use at
          home but the best results you can get are when you are under
          dentist supervision. Teeth bleaching is also used at home but
          I would recommend you to do it at your dentist place, because
          dentist supervised procedures are 90 percent successful and
          the results tend to last longer.<br>
          <br>
          - Instead of getting yellow, your teeth could get stained.
          This is also bad looking. It's very annoying to have to hide
          your smile because you have bad teeth. This stains are usually
          caused by drinks like coffee, tea, red wine or many dark
          colored foods. This nasty stains can be removed with cosmetic
          dentistry procedures.<br>
          <br>
          - If you'll go to a dentist he will surely know what to do and
          what to recommend. Dentists usually use 3 teeth whitening
          methods. This would be bleaching your teeth in-office,
          bleaching your teeth with laser and bleaching your teeth at
          home. All of this methods can have great results if all the
          dentists instructions are strictly followed.<br>
          <br>
          - Another thing that you should to before using any teeth
          whitening methods is to check your dentists past results and
          experience. It's good to choose only professionals for your
          mouth.<br>
          <br>
          - Depending on the length of time you spend bleaching your
          teeth will become brighter and brighter. Ask your dentist to
          show you some sample cards where you can see how your teeth
          will look like. This cards are very similar with ones used for
          choosing hair paints. Choose the one you like the most.<br>
          <br>
          - If you decide to use any teeth whitening products you better
          be sure that they are accepted by American Dental
          Association's Seal of Acceptance. the products that have their
          acceptance will have a seal stamped on them. this way you'll
          know that you use only good and recommended products.<br>
          <br>
          After you use any teeth whitening techniques and achieve the
          results you desired try too keep them as long as you can.
          Having a great oral hygiene will keep your smile shining for a
          long period of time.<br>
