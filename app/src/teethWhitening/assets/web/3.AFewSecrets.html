    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Within
          the last 10 years the field of teeth whitening, both in the
          dental office and at home, has changed immensely. Essentially,
          there
          are two different methods to get whiter teeth: dental
          (in-office)
          whitening, and an at home treatment. Discover a few secrets
          about teeth
          whitening that your dentist hopes I'll never tell you!<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">METHOD #1: DENTAL
            (IN-OFFICE) TEETH WHITENING</span> <br>
          <br>
          I can tell you from first-hand experience, dentists LOVE the
          patient
          who wants to have a teeth whitening procedure in the dental
          office.
          Back in the early '90's there was only one option available.<br>
          <br>
          Your dentist would make molds of your teeth, send them off to
          a lab,
          and in 5-10 days receive back your custom fitted teeth
          whitening
          mouthpiece. Then you would sit in the dental chair for 1-2
          hours, with
          these plastic teeth whitening molds filled with peroxide (at a
          very low
          concentration) pressed against your teeth and gums. <br>
          <br>
          After 3-4 visits, your teeth would be officially declared
          whiter (and
          usually they were), and you would be sent home with a nice
          $500 -
          $1,000 bill to pay. And with whiter teeth of course. <br>
          <br>
          I'll be the first to admit, dental office teeth whitening has
          come a
          long way in the past 10 years. Now the most popular teeth
          whitening
          dental office procedure known as Laser Bleaching (or Power
          Bleaching,
          Argon Bleaching, etc.) is a shorter process. Basically this
          teeth
          whitening procedure consists of the application of a
          concentrated
          peroxide gel onto your teeth, then for the next hour you sit
          in a
          dental chair with your mouth wide open, while a special light
          (usually
          argon) is shined onto the teeth whitening paste that in turn
          chemically
          reacts with the peroxide to complete the teeth whitening
          process in as
          short a time period as possible. <br>
          <br>
          This teeth whitening procedure does work. Although, many
          dentists say
          that you get a whiter smile by repeated tray applications
          because the
          teeth whitening peroxide stays in contact with your teeth for
          longer
          periods of time. The downside is that you still get stuck with
          that fat
          $500 - $1,000 bill (at least for the good teeth whitening
          procedure).And you still need to either come back 6 months
          later for
          another teeth whitening (excuse me - a touch up!), or you're
          given some
          take home whitening items. Why then did you spend $500 -
          $1,000 dollars
          for an in-office teeth whitening procedure?<br>
          <br>
          Fortunately, as most other things in life, technology stepped
          in to
          make teeth whitening easier and more affordable!<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">METHOD #2: HOME TEETH
            WHITENING </span><br>
          <br>
          I'll say this once just to get it out in the open, it's now
          possible
          (in almost all cases) to achieve "dental office" quality teeth
          whitening, from the comfort of your own home! "At-Home" teeth
          whitening
          has taken a bite out of (sorry for the pun) the "in-office"
          power
          bleaching systems, where millions of corporate advertising
          dollars now
          compete with the comfort of teeth whitening at home.<br>
          <br>
          And rightly so...<br>
          <br>
          Up until a few years ago, teeth whitening was a fairly complex
          process.
          The hard part was making those fitted mouthpieces for each
          patient, for
          this reason alone, home teeth whitening was not an option for
          most
          people. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">ESSENTIALLY, THERE ARE 3
            DIFFERENT HOME TEETH WHITENING OPTIONS
            AVAILABLE </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">TEETH WHITENTING OPTION
            #1 - BRUSH-ON WHITENING</span><br>
          <br>
          Brush-on teeth whitening in principal is a great concept, just
          brush on
          the formula, allow it to dry on your teeth, and let is stay on
          your
          teeth overnight. Sounds simple, right?<br>
          <br>
          In reality, brush-on teeth whitening is designed for the
          segment of the
          public that is in love with shortcuts (in other words, for
          those people
          who don't want to spend the time to do it right the first
          time).
          Brush-on teeth whitening has TWO MAIN FLAWS:<br>
          <br>
          1. When you brush on the teeth whitening formula, it relies on
          the
          premise that it will dry on your teeth. This is great in
          principle, but
          if you get the teeth whitening formula wet (i.e. from saliva
          or from
          licking your teeth) then it becomes REALLY easy to rub off
          parts of the
          formula. And guess what happens if you rub off only part of
          the teeth
          whitening formula? You got it - you don't get an even
          whitening result!
          It turns out patchy and blotchy.<br>
          <br>
          2. The second flaw with most brush-on teeth whitening as I see
          it, is
          the ingredients. If you look at the ingredient list of the
          leading
          brush-on whitener, you'll see the first ingredient is alcohol.
          If
          you've read my ebook <a
            href="http://www.TheraBreath.com/web/art/l/badbreath.asp">"The
Bad
            Breath Bible"</a>&nbsp; then you already
          know that alcohol is terrible for your breath! Actually, I'm
          sure the
          reason why they've added alcohol to their teeth whitening
          formula is
          because it's needed as a desiccant (something that dries out
          the
          formula so that it supposedly stays on your teeth at night).
          However,
          that still doesn't diminish the effect it can have on your
          gums and
          your breath. Also, most of these brush-on teeth whitening
          formulas
          contain glycerin which literally sucks the moisture out from
          the enamel
          of your teeth and it's the primary cause of most tooth
          sensitivity from
          teeth whitening. <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">TEETH WHITENING OPTION #2
            - STRIPS YOU STICK ON YOUR TEETH</span><br>
          <br>
          The second most common type of home teeth whitening is using
          whitening
          strips. The main lure of this home teeth whitening option is
          the
          strips' simplicity of use, they're easy to apply and no
          preparation is
          necessary. Again, everybody loves shortcuts, right?
          Unfortunately, once
          again that's exactly the type of teeth whitening you end up
          getting!
          Let me explain...<br>
          <br>
          Strips that stick on your teeth usually consist of an upper
          strip and a
          lower strip each pressed against the outer surface of your
          teeth. Now
          think about this for a second...Are your teeth completely
          flat? Of
          course not - they have recesses and grooves, particularly
          between each
          tooth. Well imagine you're painting a fence, and you just
          slapped paint
          on the outside, without taking the time to paint in the
          grooves between
          each wooden board. That fence would look pretty funny wouldn't
          it?
          Nicely painted on the outside, but in the grooves between each
          wooden
          board, still dark and dingy, with all of the old paint
          showing.<br>
          <br>
          When you use teeth whitening strips, the same thing can easily
          happen
          to your teeth if you're not careful. The whiter your teeth
          become, the
          more pronounced those dingy cracks seem! Eventually it can end
          up
          looking like you have small gaps between your teeth.
          Definitely not the
          desired result!<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">TEETH WHITENING OPTION #3
            - TRAYS WITH BLEACHING GELS</span><br>
          <br>
          Trays with bleaching gels still provide the best combination
          of the
          most affordable and most efficient teeth whitening available.
          Since I'm
          a dentist, I can let you in on a few little secrets (some
          secrets which
          most dentists would shoot me for telling you since it costs
          them
          thousands in lost income)!<br>
          <br>
          First, most of the teeth whitening gels available at your
          dentist are
          exactly the same. There is very little difference from one
          dentist to
          another, that's because the gels are formulated by a small
          number of
          manufacturers. <br>
          <br>
          Second, most of the teeth whitening gels available at retail
          stores are
          of very poor quality. They've been sitting in a warehouse or
          on a truck
          for who knows how long, and because they are designed to be
          "low cost"
          they have very low concentrations of active ingredients. Older
          teeth
          whitening gels use a concentration of only 16% of carbamide
          peroxide. <br>
          <br>
          Third, the one thing in common between dental office and
          "store" teeth
          whitening gels is that they both use glycerin as a carrying
          agent. Now
          there is nothing wrong with glycerin by itself. It is not
          dangerous in
          any way. However, when mixed with carbamide peroxide, the
          glycerin is
          used to draw water out of the enamel in order to speed up the
          whitening
          process. This is what causes the most common side effect of
          teeth
          whitening - sensitive teeth! Therefore, you're going to want
          to find a
          teeth whitening product that does not use a glycerin base.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">ARMED WITH THIS NEW TEETH
            WHITENING KNOWLEDGE, NOW WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?</span><br>
          <br>
          There are four key components I recommend for making sure you
          get the
          best possible teeth whitening results every time.<br>
          <br>
          1. Immediately before whitening, brush your teeth for two
          minutes with
          an oxygenating toothpaste combined with the finest natural
          polishing
          agents AND&nbsp; aloe vera to strengthen your gums and prevent
          any
          sensitivity. This way you're sure that the whitening gel
          directly
          contacts your tooth enamel (instead of dental plaque).<br>
          <br>
          2. Use form-fitting mouth trays that are fitted to your
          specific bite.
          Make sure they fit snugly around each tooth, and at all points
          they
          press firmly around the sides of your teeth and gums. The best
          home
          teeth whitening systems use a moldable tray system that
          contains
          mouthpieces which you can actually fit to your mouth. You mold
          them by
          soaking them for a few seconds in warm water, then you press
          the
          plastic up (or down) against your teeth and gums. When the
          plastic
          cools you have a nice soft plastic mouthpiece that is fitted
          to the
          curves of your particular smile.<br>
          <br>
          3. You should use as strong of teeth whitening gel as possible
          to
          ensure that the time your teeth are in contact with the
          whitening gel
          is well spent. Use a 21% carbamide peroxide concentrated teeth
          whitening gel that is formulated specifically to reduce the
          sensitivity
          to your teeth and gums, (in other words - NO glycerin!). This
          percentage of concentration also means a whiter result in a
          shorter
          period of time. Finally, a flavored teeth whitening gel helps
          - why not
          make the experience as pleasant as possible? No need for it to
          taste
          bad!<br>
          <br>
          4. Immediately after your teeth whitening treatment, enhance
          the effect
          by using an oxygenating oral rinse. Remember, make sure not to
          use a
          mouthwash that contains alcohol, as this can actually
          chemically
          curtail the bleaching effect, not to mention it dries your
          mouth out!<br>
          <br>
          I recommend following this teeth whitening system for 5 days
          in a row.
          You can even do the top and bottom arch separately for comfort
          if you
          prefer. After that...you'll have a noticeably whiter smile -
          guaranteed.</big></big></p>
