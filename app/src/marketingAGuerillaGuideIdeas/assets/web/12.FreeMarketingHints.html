          Marketing is about understanding your customers' needs and
          putting together and implementing a plan that encompasses
          those needs, how to satisfy them and help you build your
          business. The following represents a comprehensive list of
          affordable marketing ideas for you to use to better understand
          customer needs and ways to satisfy those needs. They have been
          compiled from various sources and are not listed in any
          particular order. It's what will work for you that counts and
          remember the top 5 "rules" of marketing:<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never let a day pass without
          engaging in at least one marketing activity.<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers buy for their reasons not
          yours. Find out their reasons to buy what you're selling!<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus all marketing materials on
          "what's in it" for the customer.<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one has ever found success by
          doing nothing.<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hire a Business Coach<br>
          <br>
          <b>Create A Unique Marketing Message:</b> Your Unique
          Marketing Message (or Audio Logo or Elevator Speech) is a
          short, 30-second sound bite that tells people what you do and
          what makes you unique. Your Unique Marketing Message should
          always offer benefits.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Use Your Photo...Everywhere:</b> People remember faces,
          not always names. If you use your photo on your business
          cards, your letterhead and your advertising, you will have a
          better chance of being remembered and people also feel as if
          they know you better.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Join A Networking Group</b> - Business networking groups
          work because they cost very little and everyone is there for
          the same reason. They are usually regular meetings where
          people exchange contacts and referrals. Ask local business
          people for suggestions on networking groups in your area.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Have Stories Published About You:</b> Have someone write a
          story about you and your business (or do it yourself). Find a
          newspaper or magazine that is willing to publish your story.
          Having a press kit helps - so does a unique "angle".<br>
          <br>
          <b>Join Toastmasters</b> - This is a world wide organization
          that has speaking clubs in most cities. Most clubs meet on a
          weekly basis and the members practice their public speaking
          skills in front of their club. You can meet new people, find
          clients, and get referrals from your fellow members.You also
          get to practice the speeches that you later give to other
          groups.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Attend Your High School, College Or University Alumni
            Events:</b> You will be surprised at how people who attended
          the same school in different decades will greet you like an
          old friend. Remember the quickest way to build a relationship
          is to find something in common. So reminisce about the good
          old days at your alma mater.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Believe In Yourself:</b> Confidence is powerful and
          seductive. Confidence<br>
          conveys success. Past, present and future. If you want your
          customers to feel confidence about their success from buying
          from you - you need to convey that confidence. If you are
          nervous and desperate we can tell. We might believe that you
          can't be any good if you are this nervous. I am not talking
          about arrogance. Just a calm projected self-confidence.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Use The Classified Ads:</b> This is a low-cost way to
          advertise on a regular basis. You may want to offer a free
          service, article or product to people who contact you.
          Classifieds are also an easy way to promote your web site.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Be Quoted in the Media:</b> Contact the media and tell them
          your expertise. Tell them that you are willing to be a
          resource if they are ever writing a story on your special
          area. Stay in touch with your contacts at the media offices
          and in time you may get a call for a quote or interview. These
          quotes give you credibility and visibility. Make copies of
          these articles for your promo kit and post them to your
          website.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Speak At Local Service Clubs:</b> A great way to gain
          credibility and visibility. Rotary clubs, Kiwanis clubs, Lions
          clubs and Chamber of Commerce meetings are always looking for
          speakers. Speak on a subject you are passionate about and that
          directly relates to your business. Rehearse, rehearse and
          rehearse. Don't forget to offer handouts with your phone
          number, email address and web site so your audience can
          contact you later.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Give Away Free Specialty Gifts:</b> Give away free
          specialty gifts with your business name, logo, phone number
          and web site imprinted on them. It's not rocket science but if
          well executed, it works. It's another layer of getting your
          brand in front of more people.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Give Free or Low Cost Workshops:</b> By offering
          workshops on topics related to your business, you can develop
          your message, meet new prospects, position yourself as an
          expert and attract new clients. Have an evaluation form for
          participants to fill out after the workshop with a place for
          them to fill out their name, address, phone number, email
          address, etc. You may also want to have a check box that says,
          "Contact me about (your product or service)".<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Create An Advocate List:</b> Begin to notice the people
          who rave about you. These are your advocates! They may be
          friends, clients, or associates. These people are your best
          referral resources. Your advocates will send you business
          simply because they believe in you. Make sure you recognize
          them as such. Never let more than 30 days go by without
          staying in touch with each of your advocates. You can stay in
          touch with a phone call, a meeting, e-mailing them, or sending
          a personal note and of course, by sending them business, too!<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Barter Your Product Or Service:</b> Approach other
          businesses to trade your product or service for theirs. Or
          better still, work through a barter exchange to do the same
          thing. You'll protect your cash flow, generate new customers,
          get rid of excess inventory and fill in the quiet times on
          your calendar.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Run A Cross-Promotion With Another Business:</b> They
          put your offer on display and you give coupons for their
          products. There are many variations of this one. You set up a
          booth in their store. You donate your product as a prize for
          their contest.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Use Postcards:</b> Postcards are a cost effective way to
          stay in touch with prospects, clients and referral sources.
          Develop a theme or character that people will recognize over
          time. Send out (or create an e-postcard) postcards with
          article quotes, testimonials, opinion surveys, correspondence,
          reminders, thank you's, announcements, newsletters, or just to
          say "hello." &nbsp;Remember marketing is telling people what
          you do over and over again!<br>
          <br>
          <b>Ask Your Clients For Referrals:</b> You've heard this
          before a million times but are you doing it? Asking, "Who do
          you know that might benefit from my services/product?" is a
          simple, yet powerful way to meet new prospects. Let your
          clients know that you are expanding and ask them if they know
          of anyone to whom you could offer a sample of your service or
          product. Remember, every dollar you don't have to spend on
          advertising and promotion goes straight to the bottom line.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Publish A Newsletter:</b> Offer valuable information to
          your readers and your newsletter will be appreciated, read and
          passed along. A newsletter establishes you as an expert,
          allows you to keep connected with many people and it gives you
          a place to share the benefits of working with you.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Use Case Studies:</b> Case studies demonstrate expertise
          and happy customers. Well-written case studies are ideal ways
          to position you as experts in dealing with specific kinds of
          clients or solving certain types of problems - perfect to
          promote your most profitable work.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Write To Your Local Paper:</b> Small newspapers often
          struggle for decent letters. Get in the habit of buying the
          local paper regularly, and write to the editor about issues
          you genuinely feel passionate about. If they are problems your
          business can fix - perfect.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Use Online Business Forums: </b>If you sell through your
          website, online business forums can be a powerful way to build
          reputation and drive traffic. Put at least an hour a week
          aside to read posts and reply with relevant comments. Be wary
          of spending more time on forums than working on your business.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Text Message Your Customers:</b> How cool would it be to
          get a text from your dentist reminding you about your dental
          appointment that afternoon? It's so easy and cheap to text
          customers, every business should be doing it. Use automated
          SMS systems to make it easy. Remember to give customers an
          easy to opt out of further text messages.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Position Yourself As Number One:</b> Carve out your
          unique position. Although there are a number ways to be number
          one in your market the simplest and most effective is to
          create your niche. Define your market the way you want it -
          then stake your claim. Domino's Pizza did not claim to be the
          best pizza - instead they created their niche - "Fresh hot
          pizza in 30 minutes or its free". They created that niche.
          They are number one in that market.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Say "Thank You" Often, In Writing And Mean It: </b>This is
          big. It is such a simple thing to do. We want to be thanked.
          How do you feel when you are thanked? How do you feel when you
          expected to be thanked but were not? A verbal thank you is
          nice - but easily forgotten. An e-mail is too cold. The
          simplest and very powerful way to say thank you - is with a
          hand written note. This one technique alone will make you
          memorable and solidify your relationships. This technique is
          so important that I repeat if for you. Say "thank you" often,
          in writing and mean it.<br>
