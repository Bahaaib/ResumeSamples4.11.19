          Through starting my own small businesses, I have learnt that
          what the marketing books tell you is not necessarily always
          appropriate for your business idea.<br>
          <br>
          Let me illustrate by highlighting some of my own mistakes.<br>
          <br>
          <b>MISTAKE NO. 1: Don’t get sucked into traditional
            advertising</b><br>
          <br>
          Many who start their own business, immediately think of some
          of the more traditional forms of advertising. They rush out
          and put an expensive advert in their city newspaper, purchase
          advertisements on the radio, or even invest in TV commercials.<br>
          <br>
          I’ve made this same mistake.<br>
          <br>
          When launching a new product I believed my best option was to
          put a full page advert in a popular financial magazine. Their
          statistics told me that 150,000 people read this magazine
          every month. Even if I only got a 1% response that would
          equate to 1500 sales.<br>
          <br>
          Well either I had a bad ad, or my ad was too far into the
          magazine, or it was just a dumb ego-driven idea, but I spent
          $7,000 for this ad which was supposed to launch my product
          into super-stardom.<br>
          <br>
          Do you know how many sales I got from this ad? TWO.<br>
          <br>
          Can you imagine the wave of depression that swept over me.
          $7,000 for two sales. That was $3,500 for each sale – and my
          product only cost $100 each.<br>
          <br>
          <b>MISTAKE NO. 2: Don’t spend money just ‘building your
            image.’</b><br>
          <br>
          Traditionalists will say that you are building your brand and
          image – but I say that’s garbage. When you’re a young, small
          business struggling to cover your basic costs, you can’t
          afford to just ‘build your image’. Every advertisement you run
          should pay for itself and make you money – otherwise don’t
          bother.<br>
          <br>
          Imagine if you employed a salesperson who never made any
          sales. Would you excuse them and say – “It’s okay – You’re
          building my image.” Of course not – you’d fire them and get
          somebody else that could give you a profitable return on your
          investment.<br>
          <br>
          <b>MISTAKE NO. 3: Don’t spend a dollar unless it makes you
            three dollars.</b><br>
          <br>
          What’s a good measure of a profitable return? A recently read
          about a young guy who has an online business and he explained
          that for every $1 he spends on advertising he expects a return
          of $3. One dollar for his ad, and two dollars clear profit.<br>
          <br>
          But can you do even better than that?<br>
          <br>
          There are many strategies you can use to generate business for
          very little up-front costs.<br>
          <br>
          Here’s a list of low-cost ideas you can apply to your business
          promotions:<br>
          <br>
          <b>Email Marketing </b>– whether you send one email or 5000
          emails the cost is the same. Make sure you only use names of
          people who have ‘opted in’ to your list to avoid spam
          complaints.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Develop joint ventures with other small businesses</b> For
          example, imagine what a Video Store and Pizza shop side by
          side could put together with a joint promotion?<br>
          <br>
          Learn how to write your own press releases and create free
          advertising for your business.<br>
          <br>
          Provide a low-cost incentive for your existing clients to
          refer you to their friends For example, 10% off their next
          purchase from you.<br>
          <br>
          Create your own email newsletter (ezine) and provide useful
          tips and information to your market.<br>
          <br>
          Can you incorporate Ambush Marketing? Eg Turn up at major
          crowd events and advertise your product or service.<br>
          <br>
          Turn your car into a Mobile advertisement with signage or
          stickers.<br>
          <br>
          Use your personal adventure exploits as media opportunities.
          Eg Richard Branson and his hot air ballooning. (It doesn’t
          have to be quite as big – but you get the idea).<br>
          <br>
          Make your building or premises an advertising sign for your
          business.<br>
          <br>
          Write articles for your local community newspaper on your area
          of expertise.<br>
          <br>
          Become the expert for your local or regional radio station
          with a short, weekly segment.<br>
          <br>
          Make your service so sensational that you become ‘dinner party
          conversation’ amongst your clients.<br>
          <br>
          Join your local business association and network among other
          businesses.<br>
          <br>
          Be creative....<br>
