          <br>
          Many people include their marketing plan as a section in their
          business plan. Really, though, marketing is important enough
          that it deserves a plan of its own, separate from the
          technical details of the business. Here’s what your marketing
          plan should include.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Your Marketing Strategy.</b><br>
          <br>
          It might sound silly, but it’s good to get the core of your
          marketing plan written down, just so people can see what the
          rest of your plan is aiming at. Keeping your strategy in mind
          can also be good when you receive offers to place ads here,
          there and everywhere – you can ask yourself whether it really
          fits in with your overall strategy.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Your Competitors.</b><br>
          <br>
          You should have a list of everyone in your area who could be
          considered to be a competitor, followed by how you plan to
          differentiate yourself from them.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Advertising.</b><br>
          <br>
          Your marketing plan should contain a comprehensive list of all
          the advertising you plan to undertake. This includes a
          website, advertising in newspapers, leaflets, and so on. For
          each method of advertising you should list an estimated cost,
          and the number of customers you expect the advertising to
          bring in. This allows you to work out your ‘cost of
          acquisition’, which is how much you need to spend on
          advertising to bring in a customer. The market works out so
          that this will be more for higher-end customers, and less for
          lower-end ones.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Pricing.</b><br>
          <br>
          Your marketing plan should also list all of the pricing
          policies you plan to have, as well as any special offers that
          you think will be good. That doesn’t mean that you can’t make
          up new offers later, but it’s still good to have some on the
          plan for the long-term.<br>
          <br>
          <b>An Example:</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b></font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>The Catering &amp; Cake Co.: Marketing Plan.</b></font></big></big></div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Strategy:</b> Our marketing strategy will be to
          advertise sufficiently that we will be the first company
          coming to mind when catering is needed in the
          Anytown/Othertown area. Marketing will be especially targeted
          towards people arranging weddings and people planning
          corporate events, so we will always be looking out for new
          ways to reach these customers. We will not repeat any
          marketing effort where the COA proves to be more than 20% of
          the profit those customers provide.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Competitors:</b> In the Anytown area, the established
          catering companies are Cathy’s Catering and Funfoods. Cathy’s
          Catering mainly cater for low-end corporate events, while
          Funfoods specialise in food for children’s parties. Our
          position in the middle-market means that we would be unlikely
          to provide children’s birthday cakes, and could provide a
          higher-quality alternative to Cathy’s Catering for corporate
          customers.<br>
          <br>
          The company that we believe would be our main competitor is
          Luxury Food and Cakes, based in the Othertown area. They serve
          the same kinds of food we plan to, and to similar events.
          However, we differentiate ourselves from them by offering our
          food at far lower prices. While they use more expensive
          ingredients, our taste tests have shown that most consumers
          are unable to tell in blind taste tests which food cost more.
          Offering mostly indistinguishable quality at a lower price
          gives us a powerful way to move in on Luxury’s customers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Advertising (in order of decreasing cost-effectiveness):<br>
            <br>
          </b><b>Leafleting. </b>$0.01 printing per leaflet, 10,000
          leaflets, plus delivery at $100 = $200. Projected 50
          customers. COA $4.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Local newspaper.</b> $500 per half page, run once
          monthly. Projected 100 customers, COA $5.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Corporate mailshots.</b> $0.10 printing per mail, 100
          mails, plus delivery at $20 = $30. Projected 3 customers, COA
          $10 (however, customers are high-value).<br>
          ‘Weddings’ magazine. $200 quarter page, quarterly. Projected
          20 customers, COA $10.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Pricing:</b><br>
          Basic catering: cost + 50%.<br>
          Deluxe catering: cost + 70%.<br>
          Cake: cost + 100%.<br>
          Large cake: cost + 80%.<br>
          Personalised cake (large only): cost + 120%.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Special Offers:</b> Business is slower in winter than
          in summer, so there are special winter deals. For example, we
          plan to offer ‘every third person free’ on basic catering to
          give extra value for corporate functions in the winter months
          (November, December, January, February). There will also be a
          ‘free champagne’ offer with the deluxe catering in these
          months.<br>
