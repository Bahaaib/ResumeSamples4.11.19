          Here are 7 low-cost but highly effective marketing tips to
          help any small business find customers and generate sales
          quickly. <br>
          <br>
          1. Don't Advertise Like a Big Business Big businesses
          advertise to create name recognition and future sales. A small
          business can't afford to do that. Instead, design your
          advertising to produce sales ...now. One way to accomplish
          this is to always include an offer in your advertising - and
          an easy way for prospective customers to respond to it. <br>
          <br>
          2. Offer a Cheaper Version Some prospective customers are not
          willing to pay the asking price for your product or service.
          Others are more interested in paying a low price than in
          getting the best quality. You can avoid losing sales to many
          of these customers by offering a smaller or stripped down
          version of your product or service at a lower price. <br>
          <br>
          3. Offer a Premium Version Not all customers are looking for a
          cheap price. Many are willing to pay a higher price to get a
          premium product or service. You can boost your average size
          sale and your total revenue by offering a more comprehensive
          product or service ...or by combining several products or
          services in a special premium package offer for a higher
          price. <br>
          <br>
          4. Try Some Unusual Marketing Methods Look for some
          unconventional marketing methods your competitors are
          overlooking. You may discover some highly profitable ways to
          generate sales and avoid competition. For example, print your
          best small ad on a postcard and mail it to prospects in your
          targeted market. A small ad on a postcard can drive a high
          volume of traffic to your website or generate a flood of sales
          leads for a very small cost. <br>
          <br>
          5. Trim Your Ads Reduce the size of your ads so you can run
          more ads for the same cost. You may even be surprised to find
          that some of your short ads generate a better response than
          their longer versions. <br>
          <br>
          6. Set up Joint Promotions with Other Small Businesses Contact
          some non-competing small businesses serving customers in your
          market. Offer to publicize their products or services to your
          customers in exchange for their publicizing your services to
          their customers. This usually produces a large number of sales
          for a very low cost. <br>
          <br>
          7. Take Advantage of Your Customers Your customers already
          know and trust you. It's easier to get more business from them
          than to get any business from somebody who never bought from
          you. Take advantage of this by creating some special deals
          just for your existing customers ...and announce new products
          and services to them before you announce them to the general
          market. Also, convert your customers into publicity agents for
          your business. <br>
          <br>
          Develop an incentive for them to tell associates and friends
          about the value of your products or services. An endorsement
          from them is more effective than any amount of advertising -
          and it is much cheaper. <br>
          <br>
          Each of these 7 marketing tips provides a simple, low-cost way
          for any small business to find customers and generate sales
          quickly.<br>
