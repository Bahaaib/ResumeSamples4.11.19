          Marketing is one of the most important business factors. From
          my experience, I have just listed 10 effective marketing
          strategies that have helped my marketing development, and hope
          will help your business,too. Here are 10 secret and effective
          marketing strategies.<br>
          <br>
          1. Create a directory of web sites on a specific topic. Give
          people the option of adding the directory to their web site by
          linking to it. Put your business advertisement at the top of
          the director's home page. This technique will get lots of
          people to linkto your web site and give you free advertising.<br>
          <br>
          2. Do you have a product or service that doesn't sell good?
          Offer it as a free bonus for someone else's product or
          service. Get free advertising by placing your web site or
          business ad on the product or in the product package.<br>
          <br>
          3. Trade autoresponder ads with other businesses. If both of
          you send out information with auto-responders just exchange a
          small classified ad to put at the bottom or top of each
          other's autoresponder message.<br>
          <br>
          4. Start a free tip line. Offer a free daily, weekly, or
          monthly tip recorded on your voice mail. The tips should be
          related to your business. Include your ad for your web site or
          business at the beginning or end of your message.<br>
          <br>
          5. Exchange content with other web sites and ezines. You could
          trade articles, top ten lists, etc. Both parties could include
          a resource box at the end of the content.<br>
          <br>
          6. Offer to insert ads into your product package for other
          businesses. Just ask, in return that they do the same for your
          business. You should only trade insert ads with businesses
          that have the same target audience.<br>
          <br>
          7. Offer a free daily class in your web site's chat room. The
          class should be related to the subject of your business or web
          site. This will get people to visit your web site everyday.<br>
          <br>
          8. Do you have a product that doesn't sell good? Offer it as a
          free bonus for another businesses product or service. You'll
          get free advertising by placing your web site or business ad
          on the free bonus.<br>
          <br>
          9. Place different emotional response ads for the same product
          or service all over your web site. One ad may hit their hot
          button to buy more than another ad.<br>
          <br>
          10. Publish your e-zine in e-book format. You could offer a
          larger number of articles per issue. It also allows you to
          include graphics with your ezine.Your advertising revenue
          would increase because you could charge businesses for large
          color ads.<br>
