          It's time to get fruity with some great small business
          marketing ideas that will help you explode your clients (not
          literally!). As a small business, marketing can sometimes be
          daunting, but take these 20 ideas and implement one idea every
          day. Put a tick list on your desk and take massive action.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Brand your Business Clearly.</b> Make sure your business
          name or logo clearly identifies the ultimate benefit of what
          you are offering, in a way which will appeal to your market;
          keep it simple, short and memorable. A store called "Gifts for
          Garden-lovers" or "Green-finger Gifts" is precise and clear;
          one called "Smith's Store" or "Universal Wonder" gives no
          clue.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>2. Be Seen in All the Right Places.</b> Think about
          where your target customers go and try to arrange to advertise
          by displaying leaflets or posters there. For the youth market,
          use Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or other online resources. For
          adults and young families it might be the local supermarket,
          the library, the gym, or the "mother and toddler" group. For
          the senior market, target locations your potential customers
          visit such as libraries, doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms,
          church halls, community centres etc. or advertise in the local
          paper or free-sheet, perhaps with a promotional discount
          voucher.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Give Your Knowledge Away.</b> What you know about your
          business and your industry is interesting and potentially
          valuable to others. Without giving away any really sensitive
          information, offer to speak at schools and colleges, women's
          groups or business clubs on a topic related to your business;
          write for the local paper or speak on the local radio and you
          will gain valuable exposure. Make your website as informative
          as possible. Tell potential customers exactly how you will
          help their business, or benefit them personally. If you can,
          reveal a few "tricks of the trade" to help them make best use
          of what you sell. Very few people will actually steal your
          knowledge to set up for themselves, but many of your customers
          will feel gratified that you are willing to be open and honest
          with them.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>4. Word of Mouth.</b> This can be a very valuable
          marketing tool - and is absolutely free! Make sure all your
          customers leave you 100% happy and satisfied with the service
          you have provided to them, and they will become ambassadors
          for your business.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>5. Investigate the Competition.</b> Use a friend or a
          paid "Mystery Shopper" to call on other businesses in your
          area to see how they operate. Get hold of their advertising
          literature and compare their offering with yours. Check out
          their websites. What can you do to make your business stand
          out?<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>6. Offer Discounts.</b> Produce Discount Vouchers to be
          used at your store or business (perhaps on certain slower
          moving products, or on certain days when your trade is usually
          slack). Add an expiry date to generate a sense of urgency. You
          could include a discount voucher in your advertising, hand
          them to each customer, or mail them to previous clients.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>7. Give-Aways.</b> Hand out free samples in your local
          high street; give customers a small free product with each
          purchase over a certain value; or have "3 for 2" offers or
          "Buy -1-Get-1-Free" promotions.<br>
          <br>
          <b>8. Linked Purchases.</b> Offer a deal where customers who
          buy product A get product B at a reduced price. This can
          encourage customers to buy two products, when they would
          otherwise only have bought one.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>9. Loyalty or Reward Schemes.</b> Issue a card to be
          stamped each time the customer buys, with a full card
          entitling the customer to a free product, or a discount on
          their next purchase (but make sure the cards and stamps are
          kept under control, or you could end up with an unexpected
          rush of claims!)<br>
          <br>
          <b>10. Competitions. </b>Run a competition and choose an
          exciting prize from your range of products or services, which
          will not cost you a great deal but which will be very
          appealing to your potential customers. Advertise the
          competition widely in the locality, send a press release about
          it to the local press and radio and, if appropriate, make sure
          people have to call at your business in order to enter - which
          gives you a chance to promote your business to them in person.
          Invite the local press to be present when the prize is
          awarded, to get some more free publicity.<br>
          <br>
          <b>11. Open House.</b> Host an open evening at your premises.
          Invite both potential and regular customers for drinks and
          nibbles and a chance to see/test your latest products, with a
          discount for purchases or orders placed on the night.<br>
          <br>
          <b>12. Join an Online Booking Service.</b> If you run a
          hospitality business (hotel, bar, pub, caf or coffee shop)
          consider joining one of the online booking services, such as
          Top Table, or Gourmet Society. This will bring you to the
          attention of travellers from other areas who might not
          otherwise find you, and you can also offer special deals
          through some sites. This can be a two-edged sword, of course,
          as the site will probably also carry reviews by your customers
          - but if you offer high-quality service and excellent food and
          drink, good reviews will boost your reputation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>13. Carry Out a Survey.</b> Have a supply of small cards by
          the till as each customer completes their transaction with
          you, asking the customer to complete a short survey on their
          experience with your business, and to fill in their details
          (especially email address). Offer a small monthly prize as an
          incentive. This will not only give you valuable feedback on
          your success (or otherwise), but you will build up a database
          of email addresses, which you can use for promotional emails,
          newsletters etc. For ideas on how to use these, click on.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>14. Collect Business Cards.</b> Copy those city centre
          restaurants and have a large glass bowl by the cash desk, to
          collect business cards (or hand-written contact details slips)
          from customers, with a monthly draw for, say, a free bottle of
          wine or champagne - this is another way of building a database
          for future marketing activities.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>15. New Image Party.</b> When you re-decorate your
          premises, hold a "New Image" party, inviting local press,
          radio, community dignitaries, neighbours, the general public
          and previous customers from your database, to show off your
          new premises, and launch new products or services.<br>
          <br>
          <b>16. Professional Brochure or Leaflet.</b> With desktop
          publishing software available on every PC and laptop, there is
          no excuse for unprofessional looking publicity material. Have
          a nit-picking friend read through any leaflet/flyer/poster you
          propose to use, to check for grammatical, punctuation and
          spelling mistakes.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>17. Error-free Website.</b> The same applies to your
          website - your professionalism is in doubt right away if your
          website is riddled with typing errors, misplaced apostrophes,
          poor punctuation and grammatical mistakes. Don't assume your
          website designer will correct your text - he or she is an
          expert in computers not grammar. If you can't afford a
          proofreader, ask a fussy friend or relation to check it for
          you.<br>
          <br>
          <b>18. Superior Telephone Service.</b> Is your telephone
          system as good as it could be? During working hours, make sure
          every call is answered within 3 rings and that the greeting
          you give is friendly and personal. Ensure that the person who
          answers your calls is trained to deal with the majority of
          customers' questions themselves. After hours or at busy times,
          make sure your answerphone message is professional, helpful,
          and proactive. Not just "please leave a message" but "we are
          so sorry that no-one is able to help you right away, but we
          promise to call you back by 9:30am tomorrow if you would be
          kind enough to leave your number" or something similar. And
          make certain you always deliver on that promise.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>19. Community Visibility.</b> Join fellow Business
          people at the local Chamber of Commerce, Business Clubs,
          Rotary Club, Round Table etc. Get involved in local charity
          events, so you gain a positive reputation for contributing to
          the community.<br>
          <br>
          <b>20. Get Involved in Local Events and Activities. </b>If
          there is a community event in your town, make sure you are
          there to publicise your business - maybe you can have small
          samples to give away, or hand out a voucher for a discount at
          your business. If there is a local charity event, take part
          yourself (or sponsor someone else to do so) carrying/wearing
          your business name.<br>
