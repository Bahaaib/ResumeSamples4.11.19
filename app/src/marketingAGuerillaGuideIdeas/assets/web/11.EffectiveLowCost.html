          Are you involved in sales or a small business and need more
          customers? But, don't have enough money to advertise to
          attract new business. There are effective ways to get new
          business without breaking the bank. In fact, most of the ideas
          here are low costs or free ideas you can use to market
          yourself or your business.<br>
          <br>
          In today's competitive market place, you MUST market
          /advertise your business. It doesn't have to be expensive. It
          just has to be done. Stewart Henderson Britt stated "Doing
          business without advertising is like winking at a girl in the
          dark. You know what you are doing, but nobody else does." Be
          sure everyone knows what you are doing. That is the most
          important rule in marketing. It's also what marketing is all
          about. Letting others know what you do.<br>
          <br>
          Nothing in life is free as you know. This includes marketing
          for new customers. All marketing has a cost involved with it.
          But, it doesn't have to cost you money. Let me explain what I
          mean. The cost I'm talking about here is your time.<br>
          <br>
          There are three ways to pay for marketing. They are 1) Money-
          meaning cash 2) Time- there's a time cost involved without
          money. It will usually be your time that's effected. 3)
          Barter- the trading of goods and services for marketing. So,
          there are lots of good ways to market of new customers without
          using money. You just need to think outside the box to find
          them.<br>
          <br>
          One of the most important things about marketing is to
          establish marketing goals. Know what you want to accomplish
          with your marketing. I would suggest having these goals. Have
          others know what you do for a living. Having people remember
          you when they have a need for what you sell. Attracting people
          who have an interest, a need, and the ability to buy what you
          are selling.<br>
          <br>
          Here are the first two things you need to do to accomplish the
          above goals. First, identify who your customers are. Know
          their demographics. Know as much as possible about them.
          Really identifying them makes it easier to find them. This way
          you won't waste your valuable time on the wrong people with
          your offer. The second thing you need to do is not follow what
          everyone else in your industry is doing. If you do what
          everyone else is doing, how will you stand out from the crowd?
          My motto on this is "If you do what everyone else is doing,
          you will get what everyone one else has got." This usually
          isn't very much! So, do something different. Be outstanding
          and be remembered by your prospects.<br>
          <br>
          There all types of low costs or free effective ways to promote
          your business for new customers. Here are just a few of them.<br>
          <br>
          The most important and costly thing you need to do is have
          good quality business cards printed. Then give these cards to
          everyone you meet. There are No exceptions to this rule. Ask
          everyone if they might be interested in learning more about
          your offer. If they say yes, explain your offer to them. Then
          ask for the sale. If they say no, ask them who they know that
          could benefit from what you have to offer. Don't ask if they
          know of anyone. You will always get a no answer by asking it
          that way. Instead, ask them who they know. Asking who instead
          of if will get more referrals<br>
          <br>
          Go door to door cold calling. (I didn't say this was going to
          be easy. I said this would work! It will work if you work it.)
          This method is for calling on businesses. Because of security
          concerns by home owners, this isn't for residential sales.
          This method works well for businesses. Start by asking the
          decision maker an open end question. This is a question that
          cannot be answered with a yes or no answer. This way you can
          control the conversation and explain your product benefits.<br>
          <br>
          Do telephone cold calling to set immediate appointments. Be
          careful about calling the DO NOT CALL LIST. Here's how to get
          around the list. Call businesses only. The list doesn't apply
          to them. Call any past customers. The list doesn't apply to
          people you have done business with in the past. Call anyone
          that has given you permission to call them for any reason.
          When calling your goal isn't to sell anything. You goal is to
          get an appointment. Do your selling at the appointment.<br>
          <br>
          Hand out business flyers with special offers on them to
          everyone. Leave these around places that your prospect might
          see them. Also, post these on community bulletin boards in
          your area. Be sure to have all of your contact information on
          them.<br>
          <br>
          Ask others to help you. Ask them for referrals. Also, ask if
          they would pass out your marketing materials. Explain to them
          exactly how they can help and what they can do. Tell them the
          type of person that you are looking to help. This gives them a
          direction in helping you.<br>
          <br>
          If you own a business, have a true one day or weekend only
          sale. You can get the word out about the sale for very little
          cost by using the internet. Post your sale on your website.
          Use your Twitter site to post information about the sale. (You
          do have a Twitter account don't you?) Also, you can send out
          an Email blast to your entire customer list about the sale.<br>
          <br>
          Make everything simple and easy for your prospects to buy from
          you. The easier it is to buy from you the more business you
          will do.<br>
          <br>
          Contact your current customer list with any new offers you
          might have. Your current customers are more likely to buy
          something else from you. This because they already know and
          trust you. Two very important things in business. Also, it
          cost five times more money to sell a new customer than a
          current customer.<br>
          <br>
          Every one of the methods listed here will be almost zero cost
          in cash to use. There are lots of other low costs and
          effective marketing methods available. You just have to think
          outside the box to discover them. Remember just don't do what
          everyone else in your type of business is doing! Good Luck and
          Good Selling!!<br>
