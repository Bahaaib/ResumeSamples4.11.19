          Have you ever wondered if you could think of a marketing idea
          that can propel your business to sky. Like, Wendy's commercial
          in the 1980's 'Where's the beef', Coke ad about it being the
          'The Real Thing' and Nike selling tennis shoes by spreading
          the word of 'Just Do It'. How ingenuous of those companies.<br>
          <br>
          When people think of marketing they tend to think of
          advertising which can be expensive, ineffective image-based
          advertising. There are many ways to position yourself as an
          expert and build a personal connection to attract new clients,
          customers and patients.<br>
          <br>
          Effective marketing is not cheap; however, there are
          strategies you can implement for little or no cost.<br>
          <br>
          A basic low-cost way to do market research is to get a poster
          and put a picture of your ideal customer on, then list your
          prospective customer fears &amp; frustrations, then list your
          customer's wants and aspirations. Then focus on the emotional
          event that caused it and the irrational dream behind it, this
          is where the power and leverage is to resolve the customer
          problem with your product.<br>
          <br>
          Develop a customer persona profile identifying where the
          customer get there information like magazines, websites and
          key people they follow blogging. Find out what 'watering
          holes/bars' they frequent, neighborhood live in, university
          attended, hobbies, favorite tv shows watched, associations,
          and church they attend. Use websites and question your target
          audience to gather this information.<br>
          <br>
          Ideally, a small business owner should spend around 35 - 50%
          of their time marketing their product. To avoid giving
          marketing of your products the short shrift. Draft a schedule
          of marketing outreach events for 6 - 12 months. Identify
          marketing opportunities, what methods you will use and when
          you will take action. With a schedule drafted in advance,
          opportunities will not sneak up on you while you're busy
          paying attention to other aspects of your business.<br>
          <br>
          If you have a marketing department to support your business
          make sure it looks like the customers you are serving. The
          power of hiring people from many different cultures, products
          and industries to come together and create products for your
          consumers is powerful. The depth of ideas, understandings,
          insights, creativity and the blending of cultures can bring
          out the best solutions for your business to make more money is
          awesome.<br>
          <br>
          Below is a list of 10 low cost strategies that can help you
          improve your profits.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1- Join your areas Chamber of Commerce</b> and participate
          in community service events. Get involved in your community by
          volunteering, donating to and/or sponsor local events. It
          gives you the opportunity to network with other business
          owners and maybe cross promote with other local. These monthly
          meetings let you know what going on economically in your area.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2- Social Media:</b> the ability to provide information
          about your products all over the web.<br>
          <br>
          Share what you do and what merchants you love. Completed a new
          project, offering a new product, and have a customer
          testimonial.<br>
          <br>
          Offer tips, advice, and information on your website. Show
          customers how to repair, modify, or improve your products.
          Provide product usage tips. The more customers enjoy your
          products, the more likely they are to buy. If you sell
          services, a question-answer column is a valuable addition to
          websites, as are "Frequently Asked Questions" pages addressing
          simple subjects related to your services. A bit of free advice
          will encourage clients to come to you with thornier problems<br>
          <br>
          Write about it on Twitter, website, Facebook, LinkedIn or on a
          industry blog. Photos and videos helps others to understand
          who you are, what you do and how it can help them solve a
          problem.<br>
          <br>
          Include your website link on all company emails and other
          correspondence. Display your company or business web address
          prominently in your email signature. Do the same on
          stationery.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3- Tell your story in 90 seconds.</b><br>
          <br>
          a. Develop an elevator pitch story to inform others about your
          business. Your story should contain the following elements.<br>
          <br>
          Who you are<br>
          <br>
          What you do<br>
          <br>
          Why your different from your competitors<br>
          <br>
          Why should they care about your products or service (what's in
          it for them)<br>
          <br>
          Does your message create an emotional response from your
          target audience demographics. Hint, use plain English in
          creating your message<br>
          <br>
          Example: We help to make your life easier by (explain your
          product or service).<br>
          <br>
          Use customer testimonials to persuade your customers to
          purchase from you. Ask for them from satisfied customers and
          use them, make sure they are genuine and go into a little
          detail with real names.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4- Develop a simple marketing plan for your business</b><br>
          <br>
          There are (4) secrets to marketing commitment, investment,
          communicate, consistency. It's difficult to maintain all (4)
          four without some basic plan.<br>
          <br>
          Make sure your plan describes how well the product or service
          meet the customers need or problem?<br>
          <br>
          Make sure your logo and marketing message use words that paint
          a picture of an experience using your product that creates an
          imagination in the customer that generate a profit (that makes
          them want to buy your product or service).<br>
          <br>
          It could consist of ordering business cards, attending
          networking opportunities, book speaking engagements and submit
          press releases about your product offerings.<br>
          <br>
          Create an email signature, with web links to your business
          website and Twitter link. Also, include your company name,
          most current achievement, telephone number and email address
          and tag line if your company has one.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5- Put together a list of previous customers and send them
            new information and promotional offers to reactivate some of
            them.</b><br>
          <br>
          Reward loyal customers with discounts. It will keep them
          coming back and help generate referrals. Good referrals from
          satisfied customers is often more effective than expensive
          advertising.<br>
          <br>
          Use social media, to offer SMS marketing (texting) to provide
          existing customers with new information about 'must have'
          discounted or liquidating items.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Improve Customer Service</b><br>
          <br>
          Customer Service is a form of advertising. You're advertising
          that you care, that gets noticed<br>
          <br>
          <b>Use your vehicle</b><br>
          <br>
          Vehicle Graphics are seen by thousands of people each day.
          Turn your vehicle into a mobile billboard.<br>
          <br>
          <b>6- Offer free public seminars or workshops</b> to general
          public to come and find out how you can solve a problem for
          them and show them how approachable and helpful you are.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Rule of Thumb:</b><br>
          <br>
          Your target customers need to hear your marketing messages at
          least 7 times to influence buying decisions. Example, you can
          craft your message a public service radio announcement to get
          it played for free on the radio stations and small internet
          radio stations<br>
          <br>
          <b>Get a Piggy Back</b><br>
          <br>
          Hitching a ride on the marketing of another company can save
          your small business time and money.<br>
          <br>
          Example: Locating near a Wal-Mart to be near price conscious
          consumers on a low budget.<br>
          <br>
          <b>7- Stimulate Customer Senses</b><br>
          <br>
          Talk to your customers about how they feel about your product
          and store experience, why they buy from you versus other
          stores, they will be honest with you.<br>
          <br>
          Continually educate your customers about the benefits of
          buying your products from you.<br>
          <br>
          The more comfortable we keep our customers, the longer they'll
          stay, the more memorable experience they'll have and the more
          they'll spend or pass on positive word-of-mouth.<br>
          <br>
          Example:<br>
          <br>
          Do you think the smell of fresh baking bread flowing
          throughout the grocery store or music is playing by choice?
          (duh)<br>
          <br>
          Retail businesses have been going out of their way for years
          to stimulate shoppers and keep them browsing scented bathroom
          spray works better than disinfectant.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>8- Make Yourself Newsworthy</b><br>
          <br>
          Get a mention of your company in the right media<br>
          <br>
          For doing a good deed in the community or a humorous tie-in
          with a sports event<br>
          <br>
          Develop a relationship with your industry trade publications
          (magazines) they are always looking for 'free relevant
          content', write and article for them. It can help you to
          appear as an 'expert' to others in your industry.<br>
          <br>
          Make contacts with local media. Newspaper and television
          reporters need reputable sources for articles; while you may
          not make "news," you can provide color to a story. For
          example, if you are a lawyer, you may be able to explain how
          new legislation will affect local viewers. Get in as many
          reporter's contact lists as possible.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>9- Form a joint venture</b><br>
          <br>
          Forging an alliance with a group of small companies or big
          company, give you 'biggest bang for the buck'. Lowering your
          costs to enter new markets and create new distribution
          opportunities.<br>
          <br>
          Make offers to other businesses that serve people in your
          target markets to pay them for referrals or sharing their list
          with you<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Support Fundraisers</b><br>
          <br>
          Donating your products or services to select charitable events
          is a great way to get your name out into the community. Be
          sure your target market will be attending and that your brand
          will be well represented.<br>
          <br>
          <b>10- Under Your Nose</b><br>
          <br>
          Are your vendors doing business with you? No, call them and
          everyone you do business with. If your product is not a
          current match to there needs, he or she probably knows someone
          who should be doing business with you. At minimum, ask to
          display your business cards and flyers at their office. Oops,
          I forgot, take a moment and make sure people in your immediate
          personal circle understand what you are selling.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Get out and walk</b><br>
          <br>
          1. Look for underutilized store front windows in high foot
          traffic areas. Approach the owner and offer to pay a small fee
          to advertise your business in their window or reverse it, and
          do the some for a fellow business owner.<br>
          <br>
          2. Scan your friends social media sites Facebook, Pinterest,
          etc. Ask them to send out a advertisement on the friends page
          about your business. Ask a friend if you can place an ad on
          his business website.<br>
          <br>
          3. Put flyers, catalogs, or brochures in every order. Make it
          easy for customers to buy from you. Don't assume a particular
          customer knows all the services you provide.<br>
          <br>
          It can take a lifetime to build a business reputation, but 20
          seconds to tear it down with the wrong message in your
          marketing campaign or an employee doing that reflects badly on
          your business. You, small business owner are the 'gatekeeper'
          of the image of the company you are trying to build. Monitor
          all communications that is released to the press about your
          business, you and someone else review all media coverage and
          commercials about your business image, to make sure it is
          consistent with what your business is all about. Most
          importantly, be honest in all communications, dishonesty can
          boomerang on you in a nightmarish way.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, marketing is about making the customer aware of your
          product and building a trusting relationship with the
          customer, and hopefully grow with the customer needs, as they
          expand.<br>
