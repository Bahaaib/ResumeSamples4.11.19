    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          In Volume 1 of Free Marketing Hints for Small Business Owners
          I wrote that marketing is about understanding your customers'
          needs and putting together and implementing a plan that
          encompasses those needs, how to satisfy them and help you
          build your business. The following represents a further list
          of marketing ideas for you to use to better understand
          customer needs and ways to satisfy those needs. Like Volume 1,
          they have been compiled from various sources and are not
          listed in any particular order. It's what will work for you
          that counts and remember again the top 5 "rules" of marketing:<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never let a day pass without
          engaging in at least one marketing activity.<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customers buy for their
          reasons not yours. Find out their reasons to buy what you're
          selling!<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Focus all marketing materials
          on "what's in it" for the customer.<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one has ever found success
          by doing nothing.<br>
          <br>
          -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hire a Business Coach <br>
          <b>&nbsp; </b><b><br>
          </b><b>&nbsp;Offer An On-line Newsletter:</b> An on-line
          newsletter via email is an effective low cost way to give
          value to people, share your knowledge, spotlight your
          expertise and promote your business. Don't expect immediate
          return on your investment. What you can expect is that people
          will get to know who you are and may eventually use your
          services. Be sure to ask first if they want to subscribe.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          <b>&nbsp;Write A Book:</b> A book is one of the best ways to
          increase your visibility and credibility. You don't have to
          write a 500 page text to be an author. You can start by
          writing about your experience or expertise, or something you
          are passionate about. Self publishing a small, informative
          booklet is a simple way to get started. Make sure that you
          include your contact information in the book so readers easily
          know how to reach you. <br>
          <br>
          <b>&nbsp;Fill Your Website With New Content:</b> Glossing over
          all of the complicated Search Engine Optimization guidelines,
          Google broadly rewards websites that consistently do two
          things: keep the content up-to-date, and add new content
          regularly. You don't need lots of specialist knowledge about
          search engine marketing. Just keep adding new pages with fresh
          content. Make a commitment to adding one new page a week and
          you will be surprised by how much extra traffic you get after
          a few months.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Create A Mastermind Group: </b>Meet with 3-5 friends
          or colleagues on a regular basis to discuss each of your
          goals, plans and dreams. When a group of people come together,
          new ideas are created that might not have been discovered
          alone. Together you will brainstorm new ways to market
          yourselves and also hold each other accountable. Everyone wins
          in a mastermind group! <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Host A Fundraising Event:</b> This is a way to give
          back even more to your community and meet some wonderful
          people at the same time. You could organize a race, a
          workshop, a raffle...just about anything you can think of to
          raise money for a good cause. You not only give back, but you
          also create more awareness about your company. Givers gain! <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Send Press Releases To The Media:</b> A press release
          is a great way to get an interview with the print, radio and
          TV media. Make sure your press release follows the proper
          format (e-mail me if you need help). Follow up with phone
          calls and ask if your press release was received and if you
          can answer any questions. Stay in touch with editors or
          reporters and let them know that you are a resource if they
          ever need information related to your expertise. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Model A Great Life: </b>A healthy, balanced,
          successful life is extremely attractive! Be an example of
          someone who is living a great life. Surround yourself with
          delightful, challenging and exciting people. Notice where you
          can improve areas of your life, such as relationships,
          fitness, playtime, finances, and your personal integrity. Then
          hire a coach like me to support you in taking action! If you
          "walk your talk," people will notice and you will begin to
          attract new clients with ease. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Form "Combo" Alliances:</b> Form an alliance with
          your suppliers, colleagues or even your competitors to offer a
          "combo" package that neither of you could offer alone. This
          way you will share the marketing expenses. Attorneys and
          accountants can offer compelling packages. For example: A life
          coach might form an alliance with a gym, weight-loss or
          stop-smoking program. <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Blog:</b> If you can't think of articles to write for
          your website, why not blog. It's a simple way to get relevant
          content onto your site. A good blog can help to brand you and
          your business as experts in the field. Much of the most
          popular blogging technology, such as Blogger or WordPress is
          free.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Get On YouTube: </b>The video website gets a huge
          amount of traffic... and best of all, it's easy and free to
          get on! Getting noticed on YouTube is often more about
          creative ideas and executing them well than just spending
          money. And don't forget too that the medium is the message and
          YouTube is hot! Remember to put the video on your own website.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Seek And Use Testimonials: </b>People feel more
          confident reading about other customers who have had a good
          experience. Keep testimonials focused on specific results,
          always get permission to use them and always use the name,
          company and website of those giving you testimonials.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Give A Guarantee:</b> If you truly believe in your
          product or service, guarantee it. Offer money back if they're
          not 100% satisfied. Yes, a few people will abuse your
          guarantee, but you'll attract more business in the first
          place.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Cross Promote Products and Services:</b> What else
          could your customers buy from you? Once they have bought from
          you once, they are in a relationship with you, and are much
          more likely to buy something else.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Do What The Others Can't or Won't:</b> Analyze your
          competitors and pick the things you think customers demand but
          no-one delivers. They will probably be hard to execute, but
          should be worthwhile (and it's because they're hard that
          no-one does them). Talk to customers to find out what they
          really want.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Sell Gift Cards/Certificates:</b> Everyone loves
          picking their own gift; if you sell products to consumers make
          sure you do this. You win with increased cash flow, increased
          business and heck, you even win if they're not redeemed (and
          many aren't).<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>&nbsp;Give Your Knowledge Away:</b> The stuff you "just
          know" in your business is potentially valuable information to
          others. With the exception of trade secrets specific to your
          company, freely give knowledge away. Write articles on your
          website or approach content marketing websites. Tell people
          exactly how you will help them and don't be afraid to reveal
          tools of the trade. Only a handful will steal that knowledge
          and try to do it themselves, and they'll never do it as well
          as you. Education marketing is powerful<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Be Seen As The Expert:</b>&nbsp; Offer advice - in
          person, through your<br>
          &nbsp;website, and/or media appearances. Become known as the
          go-to person for your industry or expertise. Do that by giving
          free information and controversial statements. If you were
          saying the same as everyone else why would we listen to you?
          Be easy to talk to, simple to understand and reachable.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Sponsor A Community Team Charity Or Special Event.</b>
          Sponsoring is friendlier than advertising. When you advertise
          we know you are trying to sell us something. When you sponsor
          a group, cause or event we like - then we are more likely to
          like you. And we would rather do business with those we like.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Associate With Winners:</b> Be seen and known by
          successful people and companies. We judge you by who you
          associate with. If you want to be successful - hang around
          successful people. Why? Because you will learn from them, they
          might inspire you, and others will associate you with
          successful people. You need your game focused on winning - not
          losing.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          <b>&nbsp;Study Your Competition: </b>Know and respect their
          strengths and weaknesses. Then position yourself to be
          completely different. Don't go head to head. Avoid price wars.
          And stay in touch. John F. Kennedy said, "Keep your friends
          close and your enemies closer."<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Exceed Expectations:</b> Always under promise and
          over deliver. Don't promise what you might not be able to do.
          That would make you a liar. Is that the way you want to be
          known? The temptation is to promise too much. Be realistic -
          then deliver just a little more.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Build, Maintain And Use An Accurate Database:</b>
          Know who your customers are. Look for patterns and anticipate
          their need. CRM, database management - whatever you call it -
          the bottom line is knowing about your customers. Who they are,
          what they do and when. Use a good computerized customer
          database system. Use it to track what happened and help you
          plan the next steps.<br>
          &nbsp; <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Make It Personal:</b> Learn personal information
          about your customers.<br>
          &nbsp;Their sports, hobbies, interest, values and dislikes.
          How do you feel when you walk into your favorite restaurant
          the maitre d' calls you by name, escorts you to your favorite
          table and brings you your favorite drink? Imagine making your
          customers feel that good.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Run A Mail-Drop Campaign:</b> Mail-drops can be a
          very effective and economical way to reach potential
          customers. You can run your own mail-drop campaign or get a
          professional company to do it for you although it can be more
          expensive. Believe it or not, a good response is 2-3 per cent
          from a direct mail campaign (that's 20-30 responses per
          thousand). Typically it costs about $10 per 100 pieces through
          Canada Post plus the cost of your mailer<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;<b>Exhibit At Shows:</b> Whether you're selling a
          product directly or building awareness of your business
          getting a booth at a fair/trade show attended by your target
          market is often a good return on investment. Get face to face
          with your prospects, plan it well, collect leads and follow
          them up!! <br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;If you are like most entrepreneurs and small business
          owners you have a limited marketing budget. That's where an
          experienced business coach can help, working with you to
          create a balanced marketing plan with a series of action steps
