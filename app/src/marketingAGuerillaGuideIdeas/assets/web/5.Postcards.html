    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          If your marketing activity doesn't include postcards, you're
          overlooking a highly effective and very low-cost sales tool.
          Here are 12 of the many reasons postcards should be part of
          your marketing program...<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Postcards Work for Any Business</b><br>
          <br>
          Postcards can produce all kinds of sales activity for all
          types of businesses. For example, they can produce web site
          traffic for online marketers, floor traffic for retail stores,
          sales leads for direct marketers ...and just about any other
          type of sales activity a business wants.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Designing Postcards is Simple and Uncomplicated</b><br>
          <br>
          Designing an effective postcard is not complicated. It can be
          as simple as printing your best small ad on a 4 x 6 card and
          sending it to a list of potential prospects. Postcards usually
          work best when the message is brief and the postcard looks at
          first glance like a message from friend.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Printing Postcards is Easy and Inexpensive</b><br>
          <br>
          You can print postcards with your own computer for about 1 or
          2 cents each ...or have them printed professionally for about
          4 to 8 cents each.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. There's a Special Low Postage Rate for Postcards</b><br>
          <br>
          You can send any quantity of postcards by First Class Mail in
          the US for only 23 cents each. The only requirement is that
          your postcards must be at least 3 1/2 x 5 inches but no larger
          than 4 1/4 x 6 inches.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Postcards Nearly Always Get Read</b><br>
          <br>
          Because postcards are delivered "ready to read", almost
          everybody will read it - even people who usually throw out
          other types of direct mail without opening it.<br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Postcards Produce Fast Results</b><br>
          <br>
          Because postcards are simple and easy to use - they produce
          results fast. You can mail postcards within a few days of
          deciding to use them ...and you'll start getting sales
          activity 2 or 3 days later.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>7. Postcards are effective for Generating Web site
            Traffic</b><br>
          <br>
          One of the most effective postcard formats simply lists a few
          benefits of a product or service on the card and tells the
          reader to where they can get more information. This makes them
          ideal for generating traffic to a web site.<br>
          <br>
          <b>8. Postcard Multiply Themselves</b><br>
          <br>
          Postcards are like small billboards - and they are easy to
          handle. They often get saved by recipients or passed on to
          others ...providing additional exposure of your advertising
          message.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>9. Markets Can Be Precisely Targeted With Postcards</b><br>
          <br>
          You can accurately target your best markets by sending
          postcards only to mailing lists of prospects likely to be
          interested in what you're offering ...and who also have a
          history of acting on offers that interest them.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>10. Postcard Marketing Results Are Easy To Measure</b><br>
          <br>
          Postcards normally generate over 90 percent of their total
          response within 7 to 10 days. This enables you to quickly and
          accurately evaluate the results of a postcard campaign.<br>
          <br>
          <b>11. Postcards Put You in Control of Your Sales Activity</b><br>
          <br>
          You can quickly boost (or reduce) your sales activity anytime
          you want by simply regulating the number of postcards you mail
          and how often you mail them.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>12. Postcards Conceal Your Marketing from Competitors</b><br>
          <br>
          Most advertising uses mass media where your competitors hear
          or see what you are doing - and copy it. Postcard marketing is
          personal. Only you and your prospects are aware of what you
          are doing.<br>
          <br>
          Postcards may be one of the best kept secrets of modern
          marketing. They're highly effective, very low-cost, simple to
          use ...and they work for any business. You're overlooking a
          profitable marketing tool if don't use them.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Postcard marketing through invincible postcard printing
          services is an essential part of a valuable modern-day
          business endeavor. Aside from the fact that it generates
          traffic to the company’s website, it also leads to high sales.<br>
          <br>
          If postcard marketing is that essential then we must master
          its concealed art - but how?<br>
          <br>
          There are various ways to master the craft of postcard
          marketing and here they are…<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1. Focus.</b> Create a target market and focus on them.
          Be sure that these postcards reach them quickly and
          effectively.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>2. Have a friendly tone.</b> The message must be
          encouraging, positive and may boosts emotional reaction and
          persuasion. That way, readers are motivated to do the call of
          action you desire. If you use a friendly tone you get a
          certain connection - a bond that makes you closer to your
          target market. They develop confidences that can go a long
          way.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>3. Puffing is no good.</b> Do not use sales pitch in
          your postcards. It will definitely annoy your readers. Thus,
          use only postcards to generate sales inquiries. State the
          benefits that customers are getting then add up other worthy
          information like phone numbers or address of your business but
          avoid puffing.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>4. Stop beating around the bush.</b> Get right to the
          point - that is! Postcards have limited space thus, it must
          convey the entire message in a few delightful words that can
          capture the attention of the readers instantly. Be brief but
          substantial.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5. Timing.</b> An author once said, if you want success the
          thing to master is proper timing. There is time for everything
          and that time should not be sacrificed or wasted. With regards
          to postcards delivery make sure they arrive on Tuesday or
          Wednesday so as not to compete with other mails.<br>
          <br>
          <b>6. Go First Class.</b> First class mail is very cheap in
          the US if they are at least 3 ½ by 5 inches but not exceeding
          4 ¼ by 6 inches.<br>
          <br>
          <b>7. Cut down on designing and printing. </b>Invest in these
          things when they are related to your services. However, if it
          is on the contrary, don’t mind having them made expensively –
          it’s not that rewarding on your part.<br>
          <br>
          The next time you need traffic in your web site or boost your
          sales percentage, consider having an efficient postcard
          printing services. They will enormously alleviate your sales
          like a rocket at a very low price!<br>
          <br>
