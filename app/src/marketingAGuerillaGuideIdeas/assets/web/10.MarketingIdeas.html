          You want to grow your small business, but how do you do that?
          Many of the small businesses I work with are not really sure
          what works best, or how, or where to get started.<br>
          <br>
          We're all familiar with the term Marketing, but what in the
          heck is it really supposed to do for us?<br>
          <br>
          * Build brand awareness<br>
          <br>
          * Build name recognition<br>
          <br>
          * Increase market share<br>
          <br>
          * Get more clients<br>
          <br>
          * Generate referrals<br>
          <br>
          * Create more repeat business<br>
          <br>
          Maybe you've tried some things in the past like brochures,
          yellow pages advertising, Chamber of Commerce networking but
          were disappointed with the results so you stopped doing them.
          And it seems that others are always willing to give you
          advice. Never mind that they have no idea what they're doing
          either.<br>
          <br>
          You know you need to be marketing, so why isn't it getting
          done? There are just so many other things to take care of when
          you are trying to run and grow a business.<br>
          <br>
          Maybe you have a lot of ideas, but still nothing happens. Are
          you guilty of any of these common small business symptoms -
          over analysis? perfectionism? fear of failure?<br>
          <br>
          If you can relate, there's a good chance that your ideas never
          get off the drawing board and put into action. And your
          visions of taking your business to new heights never
          materialize.<br>

          There is an opposite end of the spectrum which is also quite
          dangerous to the long-term health of your business.<br>
          <br>
          Action without ideas can lead to a lot of busy work without a
          lot of new business growth. You might get lucky because at
          least you're taking action. But, the results are more likely
          to be less than what you expect or need.<br>

          OK, so I'm not going to talk a whole lot today about the need
          to have a marketing plan. Obviously the first thing you need
          to do is be clear about where you're headed and what you'd
          like to get accomplished. <br>
          <br>
          For purposes of this article, I'm assuming you have some
          ideas, but just not the activity and results you need. You've
          studied up, learned some great techniques, pretty much know
          what you need to get done, and you have the best intentions.
          Then why is it you still don't seem to get any marketing
          completed.<br>
          <br>
          You see, while marketing plans are vital to your success,
          they're not the end all answer. Left alone, marketing plans
          don't produce any results.<br>
          <br>
          In order to get your ideas into action, you need a little
          something more. Here are three things I suggest to start
          putting your marketing ideas into action for your business:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1. Create A Simple Action Plan</b><br>
          <br>
          You need to have an action plan. In my experience, most
          marketing plans cover the "what you want to do," but not
          necessarily the "plan to actually get it done."<br>
          <br>
          An action plan actually translates the "what" into the tasks
          and activities needed to complete each of the objectives. Your
          action plan needs to be in sufficient enough detail for you to
          know what it takes to get the strategies and tactics
          implemented.<br>
          <br>
          Your marketing action plan could be as simple as a checklist
          of all the marketing activities you want to be implemented.
          Keep the checklist handy and check off the tasks and
          activities as they are completed.<br>
          <br>
          A marketing checklist like this can act like a scorecard to
          keep track of what you've accomplished and what still needs to
          get done.<br>
          <br>
          For some, a simple marketing checklist oriented action plan
          may not be quite enough. You may need to invest a little more
          time and energy in creating a more detailed plan to put your
          ideas into action.<br>
          <br>
          Consider this approach... Start by identifying the three
          primary desired outcomes you'd like to have in the next six
          months. Now for each of those desired outcomes, identify three
          key things that need to be accomplished in the next 90 days
          towards achieving the outcome.<br>
          <br>
          Then take each of those three key things and break it down in
          to three or four tasks that need to be completed. Maybe even
          limit it to key tasks that should get completed in the next 30
          days. Finally, go back and start putting estimated complete by
          dates for everything you've outlined.<br>
          <br>
          Now you've got an action plan to move you forward.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Create A Marketing Focus Calendar</b><br>
          <br>
          Once you've determined what you need to put into action,
          schedule them on a calendar.<br>
          <br>
          One of the classic problems small businesses experience is
          getting nothing done because they are so overwhelmed when they
          look at EVERYTHING that needs to get done.<br>
          <br>
          Choose a small handful of the marketing strategies and tactics
          that you feel best about and you think will be most
          productive. Decide how often you'll implement each idea. For
          example... attend five networking events per month, give one
          presentation per quarter, send one eZine per month, and go on
          two potential business partner lunches per month... You get
          the picture.<br>
          <br>
          Now look at your calendar and start writing down activities
          for each of the months you want to get things done. Commit to
          at least a couple of significant marketing activities or
          tactics every month.<br>
          <br>
          Look over the calendar to make sure it's balanced with a
          decent mix of the approaches you've chosen. Track all of your
          marketing efforts so you know what to add, change or remove
          from the calendar.<br>
          <br>
          Map out your marketing focus calendar and hang it up on the
          wall by your desk. This very simple tactic can be very
          powerful for putting your ideas into action. The key here is
          that you're getting the plan down in a format that makes you
          more likely to stick with working the plan.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Schedule Marketing Appointments</b><br>
          <br>
          Book a regularly scheduled appointment in your calendar for
          yourself. One of the best ways to force yourself to put your
          marketing into action is to schedule a marketing appointment
          like you would with your best client.<br>
          <br>
          Don't kid yourself. If you want great marketing results, it
          takes some regular and consistent effort on your part. You can
          create that regular and consistent effort by scheduling time
          for yourself. Then when the appointment is on the calendar,
          don't schedule over it.<br>
          <br>
          Don't let anyone infringe upon this time, not even your best
          client - except under extreme circumstances. When someone
          wants to book an appointment with you that overlaps this time,
          tell them you've already got something scheduled and see where
          their flexibility is. It's not important that they know that
          the scheduling conflict is time you've set aside for yourself.<br>
          <br>
          Hold yourself accountable for making this appointment on time
          every time. Make productive use of your time by turning your
          ideas into actionable plans and working the action plans.<br>
          <br>
          I'd predict that you'll begin looking forward to this time as
          you start putting ideas into action and getting greater
          marketing results. Ideas without action will get you nowhere,
          so even a little action today is a good start. <br>
          <br>
          Ready? <br>
          <br>
          Go!<br>

              Breakthrough</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          1. Focus on your target markets' primary concerns in your
          sales calls, your brochure, your ads and on your web pages.
          Your prospects' problems and wants brought you together; use
          this to keep prospects' attention.<br>
          <br>
          2. Use questions to get the conversation going. Whether you're
          on the telephone, writing web page copy or writing an ad, ask
          your prospects questions to get them thinking about what they
          want and how you can help them.<br>
          <br>
          3. Give something away that your prospects need. The more
          helpful information you give away to prospects, the more
          business you'll receive in return. Give away ideas they can
          use and help them understand when and how to use your products
          and services.<br>
          <br>
          4. Build a mailing list of people who want more of your ideas
          and information. Use the list regularly to stay in touch and
          you'll increase your credibility the perceived value of your
          goods and services, and your sales.<br>
          <br>
          5. Other breakthrough ideas - When people are at the point of
          purchase, prompt them to buy additional products and you can
          double your revenue.<br>
          <br>
          Call people who have bought your products after a couple of
          weeks to get feedback. There is a good chance they'll be
          interested in buying additional products or services.<br>
          <br>
          Whether you want to become an expert at marketing, skiing or
          cooking, the key is to let go of methods that aren't working
          for you, and learn and apply the techniques used by the
          experts. Nine times out of ten, the problem is in getting the
          basics right. You can achieve a breakthrough in sales when you
          understand and apply these proven marketing principles and
          techniques.<br>
