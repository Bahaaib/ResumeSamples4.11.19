          There are many ways in which you can create a blog, the
          easiest being to use a blog host such as Blogger or
          Wordpress.com. Using these, you can create your blog on any
          topic you want and even customize it to suit your needs to a
          certain extent.<br>
          <br>
          I say ‘to a certain extent’ since no blog that is operated
          from a blog host’s website can ever be truly yours, and you
          consequently have limited control over the design and
          occasionally even the content of your blog. That is because
          neither the software needed to manage the blog, nor the files
          that hold your content, are contained on your website, but on
          that of somebody else. That ‘somebody else’ is either the
          operator of Blogger or of Wordpress, or whatever blogging host
          you happen to be using.<br>
          <br>
          So what does that mean to you in practise? I have no intention
          of going over the pros and cons of the hosted versions of
          Wordpress and Blogger, and have provided a link on my website
          that provides that information for you, but it should be clear
          to anybody that if you host your own blog from your own
          website, you have much more control and latitude in the
          design, formatting and content of your blog.<br>
          <br>
          It is not difficult to upload Wordpress to your website and
          run it from there. You can then upload any number of the
          multitude of plugins and templates available to enable you to
          design your blog in any way you want. You can change the
          appearance and content not only of your navbar, but can use
          html to change practically every aspect of your blog to suit
          your needs. The question you will be asking is how you get
          Wordpress onto your own website.<br>
          <br>
          It is easier than you think. Wordpress.org provides the
          software, and you have to upload it to your website into a
          directory of your choice. The easiest way is to use an ftp
          client, and you can get information on good free ftp software
          on my website or blog. You then have one or two alterations to
          make to some of the files and you are done. You have a blog
          that you can change to suit your own needs without any of the
          restrictions that are imposed by the Wordpress website.<br>
          <br>
          You can change the template to any of the thousands on offer
          online, either free or paid, and you can also use software to
          design your own or to customize the templates to your own
          design. You can change the whole look and feel of your blog,
          and offer whatever links that you feel necessary. You can put
          whatever adverts on your blog that you want, including Adsense
          blocks, and use your blog to make you money.<br>
          <br>
          Creating a blog is easy, and if you know how to create a blog
          exactly as you want it, then you will have a great tool at
          your disposal that you can use to promote any product you
          want, and also to make direct sales, either of products or of
          advertising. There are many ways in which you can use your
          blog either to promote products or to earn money through
          advertising. You have few restrictions when operating a
          Wordpress blog from your own website; all you have to know is
          how to do it.<br>
          <br>
          In recent years, blogging has become a new sort of art form.
          In the sense that all writing is art, blogging is just another
          branch of that. Many who spend the time creating and
          maintaining a blog are those who choose to use the internet as
          their means of sharing their thoughts, feelings, hopes,
          dreams, and everything about life in between.<br>
          <br>
          Many people use these blogs to share themselves with others
          all over the world. Those who choose to do so can easily set
          up an account with a blog provider and create their own
          personal journals. This is a great avenue of expression for
          many.<br>
          <br>
          Recently, however, trends have also shifted towards the use of
          business blogs. These are used to promote companies or
          products. Bloggers generally post articles that are relevant
          to the company or product and are intended to draw attention
          from potential customers. This can help to increase sales,
          thus becoming a profitable venture.<br>
          <br>
          For those interested in creating a blog, consider the
          following tips to insure that your blog does exactly what you
          want it to do.<br>
          <br>
          First of all, it is important to take into consideration the
          audience to whom you will be addressing. No matter what your
          purpose, you have to generate a blog that will be interesting
          to them. A blog is your voice, but you have to "speak" in a
          way that others can understand and will want to return in
          order to be successful.<br>
          <br>
          Secondly, remember the importance of pictures. Often, a good
          picture can say more than pages of writing. Not only does it
          say what you cannot many times, but it also helps to make your
          blog more entertaining to browse. This does not mean you have
          to post personal pictures of yourself. Remember to be safe and
          also to protect the privacy of others, but you can post any
          photo that does not insult those who would be reading your
          blog.<br>
          <br>
          Next, consider being constructive in your writing. You blog
          can be on any topic, or lack thereof, that you wish, but
          consider using that avenue to be of some benefit to others.
          Sure, you can write about anything you want, but it is often
          nice to include some articles that would be helpful to those
          reading your blog. Provide some useful information instead of
          just entertainment.<br>
          <br>
          Along the lines of keeping the interest of your readers, do
          not make a blog that is too technical or formal. Using
          complicated techniques or extremely highly-educated language
          may turn off readers instead of welcoming them. Remember that
          you can make quick factual statements and shorter blog
          comments instead of feeling that you have to make a lot of
          long entries. You are generally not writing to an audience
          made up solely of scholars.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, remember that most people who read blogs
          typically enjoy the internet by scanning for information. You
          would be best advised to offer shorter statements and colorful
          pictures with article links than to offer long articles that
          readers may find too overwhelming. As mentioned earlier,
          remember who your audience is.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, if possible, add some sort of interactive function to
          your blog. You can include videos or audio segments. You can
          also have a guestbook or comments area where readers can post
          their own thoughts in relation to what you have said. You will
          be able to see how others react to your reactions about life.<br>
          <br>
          Yes, even those blogs that are created for fun serve a
          purpose. Whether you create a blog to sell a product or just
          sell your sense of humor to the rest of the world, a blog is a
          great avenue for creative writing.<br>
          <br>
          Once you know how to create a blog on your own site, you can
          harness the power of blogs to achieve what want to achieve
          with your website. There are few limits and your imagination
          will be your major asset, so use it.<br>
