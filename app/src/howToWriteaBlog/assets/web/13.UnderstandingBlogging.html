          Blogging, what is it?<br>
          <br>
          There are still people who do not know what blogs are. Because
          of the unusual name, people tend to think unpleasant things
          when they hear the word “blog”. Is it a murky mixture of sand,
          water and dirt?<br>
          <br>
          Blogs are like bulletin boards in the internet that are
          updated regularly, often in a daily basis. The contents of
          blogs are information about a specific topic, or in some types
          of blogs, people sometimes use them as a journal or diaries
          where they put in the details of their personal lives, their
          opinions about certain topics and even social commentaries. To
          put this in simple terms, blogs are used by the person who
          created the blog anyway he or she wants them to be. The
          creator of a certain blog is the author and its his or her
          responsibility to provide the contents.<br>
          <br>
          To start or create a blog, here’s a few guidelines to get
          readers to actually read your blogs.<br>
          <br>
          Blogging is simple and easy to do. All you need is a computer
          and an internet connection.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Pick a topic and stay on it</b><br>
          <br>
          To create a successful blog, you first have to pick a topic
          that you are interested or knowledgeable in then write an
          article about it. Although your opinion about a certain topic
          is acceptable, it is wise that you should stick to facts as
          much as possible. You can also mix in some humor if you want
          it to be more fun to read and also include your personal
          experiences about the topic. This would make the readers think
          that you actually experienced what is being discussed.<br>
          <br>
          For example; your topic is about tennis, people who’ll be
          reading this is interested in tennis, therefore you shouldn’t
          write about what you watched on TV last night, include some
          tips that may interest readers, like how to improve your
          forehand or backhand and even how to prolong their tennis
          ball’s life. Stick to the topic, although you can also include
          some humor you experienced in the tennis court. Everyone did
          something stupid or embarrassing in a tennis court, its good
          to share them with people; it creates a more personal view of
          your blog and may seem friendly to read.<br>
          <br>
          If you’re going to include humor or opinion in your blog, it
          is important that you balance it with factual information.
          Talking about your personal experience, whether good or bad,
          can affect your reputation in the web. Include some updated
          news about whatever product or service you’re discussing. It
          is good that you base your opinions on facts and include some
          advantages and disadvantages and remember to balance it.<br>
          <br>
          Remember that no one will read old news; always keep your blog
          updated. Present it with factual news that is accurate and
          informative. If you write about something that happened a few
          months ago, it will not grab the reader’s interest. Writing
          about someone who won the Wimbledon Tournament that happened a
          few months ago will make people think that you are not
          updating your blogs and won’t read your blogs again, ever.<br>
          <br>
          However, updating blogs is a very strenuous task; plan a
          schedule on when to update your blog and stick to it. Twice or
          thrice a week would be good enough to keep your readers loyal.
          Also, tell your readers on when you will update your blogs by
          posting it in the website. Remember that communication is the
          key to success to attract readers to your blog. No
          communication, no readers.<br>
          <br>
          Keep you blog simple to understand. For example; your blog is
          about your gun hobby, do not put in technical terms and so
          many numbers. such as: “This .50-70 M-1874 Belcher, 12 pounds,
          .50 cal. 2 1/2-in. 70 grn or FFG &amp; 370 gr. PP” and so on,
          this will get readers to close your blog page on the first
          second they see it. Put it in simple terms as much as
          possible. Remember that many people are interested about a
          certain topic but do not actually know the technical terms, in
          this case, about guns.<br>
          <br>
          Your headline should be large, bold letters that can easily
          catch a reader’s attention. Naming your headline is also
          important. Do not just put in “Guns” or “Tennis”, but think of
          a catchy phrase to get your readers to actually read your
          content.<br>
          <br>
          Put your old, similarly themed blogs in an archive. This is
          great for someone who is interested to read your old blogs.
          The keywords in your archived blog are also important to
          generate targeted traffic in your blog.<br>
          <br>
          If you have written an article before, you probably know that
          it is important to spell check and proof-read what you wrote.
          Remember that what you write reflects your reputation. If you
          stumble upon a sentence, redo it.<br>
          <br>
          These are some of the things to consider if you’re planning to
          blog. By following these few simple guides, you can be sure
          you’ll get a lot of readers and also keep them reading.<br>
