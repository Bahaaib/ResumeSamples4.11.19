          The basics of blogging cover all the basic essentials,
          including your writing style, blog category and the content of
          your blog. Planning your blog can be difficult if you do not
          know what you want to talk about. It could be extra hard if
          you do not have the necessary background in blogging. However,
          knowing what you want to blog about can easily come to you
          once you start browsing and poking around other blogs. You can
          pick ideas from those blogs, expound and make them the basis
          of your blog.<br>

          Generally, there are several types of blogs. Nevertheless,
          there are three popular categories of blogs, such as: the
          organizational, business and personal blogs.<br>
          <br>
          The first category, the organization, uses the power of blogs
          to communicate either externally with the public or internally
          within their organizations. This kind of blog has the purpose
          of facilitation internal communications amongst employees,
          colleagues and other organizational personnel. In addition,
          organizational blogs normally publish information that is of
          interest by the public. In a certain instance, there are
          organizational blogs that publish seminar schedules, meetings,
          and announcements for their clients, customers or members.<br>
          <br>
          The business blogs, on the other hand, are for promoting
          services or products offered by businesses in order to help
          increase profits, revenue and interest of potential consumers.
          These kinds of blogs can look for ways to increase their
          reputation and authority with vendors, customers and partners.
          They do this by publishing contents that express expertise and
          knowledge within a specific market portion, niche or industry.<br>
          <br>
          The personal blogs are those that contain contents that are
          more of a reflection of bloggersâ€™ opinions and thoughts.
          Normally, they are used to publish articles that voice their
          points of view on several kinds and varieties of events and
          topics. Bloggers who publish personal contents usually find
          pleasure in documenting their everyday lives, stream of
          consciousness and even their hate to specific events through
          articles that reflects their moods.<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Your target audience and blogging style comes hand in hand.
          The moment you think of creating your own blog, you must first
          realize what your target audience is; you must know what they
          want, need and desire to read about. The blog you create and
          the contents you publish must provide quality and value to the
          readers in order to be effective in establishing communication
          and expanding readership.<br>
          <br>
          More so, the kind of blog you want to create essentially
          creates its own target audience. For instance, an
          organizational blog is meant for those who are members or
          clients of a certain organization. Although the target
          audience may be limited, there is a good chance for
          consistency with regards to the dialogue you create with your
          readers and eventually more people would be interested in your
          blog.<br>
          <br>
          The mentioned personal blogs are not normally designed for
          social dialogue with a certain target readership of any
          category and is rather meant to serve as a collection of your
          musings. These kinds of blogs are best reserved to your close
          friends and they are your target audience.<br>
          <br>
          If you identify your target audience successfully, your
          messages that you want everyone to know about will be
          effectively targeted. Some of the greatest joys of blogging
          come from the use of your enthusiasm in publishing
          signification information for a community where there is a
          free exchange of opinions between the readers and you.<br>
