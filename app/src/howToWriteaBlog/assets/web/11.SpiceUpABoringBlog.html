    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          There is nothing worse than coming across a boring blog. The
          difficult thing is that what is boring to one person might be
          interesting to another. Therefore, you really need to focus on
          your readers when creating new text and posts for your blog. <br>
          <br>
          If you want the blog to be successful, you cannot simply
          expect your day to day activities to be enough information to
          keep the readers interested. If you post that you went to the
          grocery, came home, and then ate dinner, you can expect the
          readers to be bored out of their minds. <br>
          <br>
          If you find humor in your activities or if you tell them in an
          interesting manner, you might keep their attention even when
          using the same day to day activities. If you want to spice up
          a boring blog, you can also use these tips to get things
          moving in the right direction.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Allow Comments</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          One big mistake boring bloggers make is to not allow comments.
          You should always allow people to comment on your blog. You
          may not always like what they have to say, but their comments
          alone will help your blog seem more interesting to anyone who
          reads it. If you want to be sneaky, you can even comment on
          your blog yourself, using a different name. <br>
          <br>
          This can quickly create a controversy that some readers will
          appeal to. Try being honest and letting the readers comment
          themselves, but if all else fails, use the sneaky approach to
          break the ice. Once one person makes a comment, others will be
          more likely to comment as well. <br>
          <br>
          This will help get things going and make your blog a place to
          bounce ideas off of others.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Ask Questions</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Another great way to provoke your readers to participate is to
          ask open-ended questions. You can do this throughout your blog
          or at the end. This will be seen by readers as an open
          invitation to respond. Your questions will get them thinking
          about what you have to say, whether or not they respond. <br>
          <br>
          They will be more likely to come back to your blog to read
          more about your comments later on. Everyone has an opinion on
          everything, so go ahead and ask your readers straight out what
          theirs is.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Use Pictures</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          If you want to connect more with your readers and keep them
          interested, try adding pictures to your blog. Adding pictures
          is simple through your blogging software. Get a digital camera
          if you don’t already own one so you can update your pictures
          frequently. <br>
          <br>
          By adding pictures that go along best with the content of your
          posts, you will be connecting with your readers on a more
          intense level. They will be more entertained and you will have
          a more interesting blog. Just be sure that you don’t overdo it
          on the pictures. Place them in appropriate places and don’t
          use massive pictures or else you might take the risk of having
          a blog that take ten minutes to load. <br>
          <br>
          Do be sure that you use close-ups however. You wouldn’t want
          to use pictures that were impossible to see on the screen.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          When writing your posts, you should always act as if you were
          talking to a great friend. Some people create boring blogs by
          writing as if they were writing a textbook. <br>
          <br>
          This is a huge mistake. <br>
          <br>
          People most often read blogs because they want to be
          entertained or gather interesting information or opinions.
          They do not want to read a blog that sounds like a textbook.
          Try to be a little personal in your blog. Let your own
          personality shine through. Allow your individual humor to be
          seen in each post. <br>
          <br>
          Your readers will appreciate your honesty and love you for
          your casual style.<br>
          <br>
          Use these great tips to spice up your blog if it is hitting
          the boring stretch. A boring blog is one that pains people to
          read. Keep in mind that successful blogs will make people
          laugh, think, contemplate, and gain useful information. You
          can do all of this using these tips. <br>
          <br>
          So, get to work and completely transform your boring blog
          today! You will see an improvement in your traffic and likely
          enjoy blogging a lot more than before.<br>
