          The blogging platform wars are getting really interesting and
          much of the discussion I find myself in lately revolves around
          what is happening with various CMS systems. The market can
          essentially be defined into 3 major camps: remotely hosted,
          self hosted, and community based systems. I have used pretty
          much every blogging platform available and each of them has
          its ups and downs. <br>
          <br>
          In this article I will cover the best options for each area
          taking into account price, usability, market share and of
          course SEO potential.<br>
          All of these products are either open source, completely free
          or have a functional free version.<br>

          (Note: I cannot really recommend any of these from an SEO
          stand point as optimizing a domain you do not own or control
          is obviously not a good marketing plan.)<br>
          <br>
          <b>Blogger</b><br>
          <br>
          Blogger is completely free and currently owns the majority of
          the remotely hosted user base, but not by a land slide .
          Bought out by Google in 1999, Blogger essentially fired up the
          blogging trend we see today. It is by far the easiest overall
          solution to use and if you are a novice user looking to throw
          up some recipes or poetry, this is for you. Blogger is
          completely free and includes some great features like
          comments, photo blogging, and a basic community feel with user
          profiles. <br>
          <br>
          Because it is so dumbed down there are some features you may
          not find with Blogger that are only available through 3rd
          party add-ons. As a side note Blogger weblogs do quite well in
          the search engines and this was recently exploited with it
          being the first choice for spam blogs or splogs. <br>
          <br>
          A splog is a weblog used for the sole purpose of gaining
          inbound links or generating thousands of keyword stuffed pages
          with Adsense and the like. <br>
          <br>
          The recent Google Jagger update cleared a large portion of
          this up. <br>

          <b>Typepad</b><br>
          <br>
          Released in 2003 Typepad is a product of Sixapart, the makers
          of Movable Type. it is largely based on MT but there are some
          major enhancements and differences. Your blog can accomodate
          one or more photo albums with auto thumbnail generation. You
          can easily add music, books, and other media to Typelists,
          which grab a thumbnail from Amazon and other retailers for
          easily displaying in your sidebar. <br>
          <br>
          Typepad is also a great deal more technical than Blogger so a
          bit of HTML know how is recommended. On that note editing your
          blog to look the way you want it also quite easy and Typepad
          blogs are known for being very eye pleasing, intuitive and
          easy to navigate. In Sixapart's business model Typepad is
          aimed at regular home and small business users while Movable
          Type is targeted at larger businesses or for internal
          intranets. <br>

          <b>Xanga</b><br>
          <br>
          These guys originated back in 1999 as a site for sharing book,
          music and movie reviews. Although it quickly morphed into a
          full blown blogging tool Xanga still maintains the ability to
          run a powerful review site. Xanga pulls data from several
          retailers like Amazon.com including thumbnails, pricing and a
          cover. <br>
          <br>
          The software also is very usable by novices with a powerful
          WYSIWYG editor allowing for easy HTML editing, adding smilies,
          links, and other symbols. By using Blog rings it is also easy
          to interface with Xanga's other 3 million users to share
          interests, ideas, and of course traffic. Xanga comes in a free
          and $25 flavor.<br>

          <b>WordPress</b><br>
          <br>
          WordPress originally began as a mod of an older open source
          package known as B2. WP is MT's biggest competition and is
          often the bain of endless Wordpress vs Movabletype style
          threads around the internet. Although launched just over a
          year or so ago WP has really taken the blogosphere by storm.
          And with good reason - Wordpress is completely free under GNU
          licensing and is packed with many featured you will not find
          anywhere else. <br>
          <br>
          It is also much easier to install and get blogging for novice
          users and has a very large and helpful community. WP runs on
          PHP/mySQL and is quite scalable judging from some of the very
          large and trafficked sites I see using it. It also sports
          utilities to import files from Movable Type, Textpattern,
          Greymatter, Blogger, and b2. Wordpress recently upped the ante
          when Yahoo recently included them on their hosting packages,
          in addition to MT. <br>
          <br>
          I have to admit I am finding myself more and more digging WP.
          <br>
          <br>
          Wordpress is free.<br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Movable Type</b><br>
          <br>
          Aside from maybe Greymatter (the original open source blogging
          tool), Movabletype dominated the blogging market share in
          2002-2004. Released in late 2001, Perl based Movable Type by
          Sixapart has maintained a large portion of the blogging market
          share, due mainly to the fact that there is a free version
          (supporting up to 3 weblogs) and that it is incredibly
          powerful, intuitive and easy to customize. <br>
          <br>
          Template driven Movable Type also sports one of the largest
          communities of developers and blogging enthusiasts around,
          meaning lots of support, idea sharing, and of course plugins.
          Movable Type can be configured to dynamically generate HTML,
          PHP or any other kind of pages you like, meaning it is
          incredibly scalable, fast, and loved by spiders. <br>
          <br>
          It is perhaps the most well known blogging software for SEO
          purposes and it what currently powers Profitpapers and several
          of my other projects. Moveabletype is either Free with 3
          authors, 1 weblog, and no support or $69.95 with unlimited
          weblogs, authors and full support.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Textpattern</b><br>
          <br>
          Textpattern is the brainchild of Dean Allen and was written to
          ease publishing of content for those not inclined to learn
          HTML. Like WP and MT Textpattern runs on PHP and mySQL for
          easy administration, backups, and power. What really sets
          textpattern apart from the others is the integration of
          Textile. Textile is a tool for easily formatting content for
          those who do not know HTML. <br>
          <br>
          WP &amp; MT have modules for textile as well but it is native
          to the Textpattern system. Another bonus of the app is its
          superior handling of comment spam due to its smaller market
          share. On a blogs I maintain running WP and MT I often find
          myself clearing out spam every day, whereas on some very busy
          textpattern sites I receive only manual comment spam (not bot
          driven). TP is open source.<br>

          <b>Slash</b><br>
          <br>
          Waaaaay back in 1997, Rob "CmdrTaco" Malda launched a website
          known as Chips &amp; Dips, supplied via his student account at
          Hope College in Michigan. In 1999 Andover.net acquired
          Slashdot. Shortly after, the underlying code was released as
          open source software called Slash. Like Movable Type and
          Greymatter, Slash runs on Perl, but it also has established
          hooks into MySQL and a very strong track record of scaling to
          enormous traffic levels. <br>
          <br>
          To give you an idea, the term 'slashdotted' originated from
          acquiring a link on this now infamous and very popular tech
          news website â€“ and consequently watching your servers melt. If
          you have never messed around with Slash, you really should as
          it is quite a powerful platform. <br>
          <br>
          Slash is open source.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Scoop</b><br>
          <br>
          Another well known Perl based community blogging software is
          Scoop. Scoop is the software that powers Kuro5shin, DailyKos
          and many other busy community weblogs. Scoop took the Slashdot
          idea and expanded on it, making the discussion rather than the
          news the focus of the application. Where Slashdot entries tend
          to have a link with added commentary pointing readers off the
          site, Scoop points to stories written by members of the
          community keeping the reader within your own weblog. Scoop is
          also well known for handling large volumes of traffic and a
          large very technical community. <br>
          <br>
          Scoop is free.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Drupal</b><br>
          <br>
          Drupal is a well known open source community blogging platform
          with a very large community of users and developers. Not only
          is Drupal free but it is damn powerful. Instead of Perl, which
          is quite hard to decode at times, even if you are a fluent
          coder, Drupal uses a PHP/mySQL platform. <br>
          <br>
          Drupal is also a very community focused application with a
          built in forum, download area, and hundreds of other home
          brewed mods and hacks. If you are looking for a lot of
          functionality give Drupal a check - the project has become
          quite mature. It is also much easier to use and customize than
          either Scoop or Slash. <br>
          <br>
          Drupal is also another open source project.<br>
