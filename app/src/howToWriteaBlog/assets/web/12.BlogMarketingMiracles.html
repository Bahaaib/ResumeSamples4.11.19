          It is nothing you have not heard for quite some time now.
          Blogging has caused quite a stir. It has, in fact, continued
          to proliferate rapidly. In early days, a blog is just a
          personal online diary. It is a place to publish one’s
          thoughts, to collect and share things that one finds
          interesting. It is a venue to express one’s rants, raves and
          musings. <br>
          <br>
          Today, professional and amateur journalists, political
          pundits, business honchos, entertainers, everybody seems to be
          blogging. Blogs are now being used to promote a business, run
          a political campaign, elicit publicity, among others.<br>
          <br>
          A blog or weblog is an online diary of events arranged in
          reverse chronological order. The author of a blog is known as
          a blogger and writing or maintaining a blog is referred to as
          blogging. An individual entry or article is called a post and
          is available in the form of a blog page for the public to
          read. <br>
          <br>
          A blog may have a commentary box for readers to leave comments
          or opinions. These comments act as stimulus for further
          conversations. A business or corporate blog is simply a blog
          about a specific business. It is an effective medium for
          communicating with current and potential customers to share
          knowledge and expertise and foster relationships.<br>
          <br>
          A company that employs a well-planned blogging strategy can
          spur significant market gains and sales earnings. Marketing is
          not just promoting a product or service. More importantly, it
          is about understanding the needs and wants of customers and
          developing products or services that satisfy these needs and
          wants effectively.<br>
          <br>
          A blog enables a company to reach out to current and potential
          customers, in a more personal way. A blog builds connection
          and links between the company and its key audience which helps
          the company use this network over time to improve overall
          business. <br>
          <br>
          A business blog especially if regularly updated can inform
          readers about a company product or service, information,
          industry news, tips, tutorials or company developments. Links
          to industry-related stories can also be found in a blog. The
          way the targeted audience responds to these information or
          content is important to any company.<br>
          <br>
          A blog is a good venue for customers to air issues, concerns
          and give comments. Through a blog, customers can give their
          own inputs. A company can hear directly from customers and
          understand what they desire to get from a product or service.
          Sometimes, the most well-intentioned product under perform
          because of lack of customer feedback. <br>
          <br>
          With blogging, a company can ask for feedbacks, albeit not the
          whole world, but at least the blogging community. Once a
          company has insights into what a large community thinks of the
          product or service, the company can then further improve the
          product or service to meet customer requirements. After all,
          customer satisfaction is of utmost importance.<br>
          <br>
          A company who listens and responds to customer feedbacks
          conveys the message that there is somebody who listens behind
          an otherwise faceless company. Because a blog is
          conversational, it gives the company a human voice.<br>
          <br>
          This assures customers that there is a “real” person who will
          take care of their needs. Customers will feel an affinity with
          the company. Regular visits brought about by regular updates
          thru fresh blog entries will familiarize the customers with
          the company and make them feel that they personally know the
          company. <br>
          <br>
          In due time, trust and loyalty is built and relationships
          fostered. As we all know people generally buy products or
          avail the services of people they know and trust. Rest assure
          that return visits to the blog, maybe for more information
          will transpire even after a purchase has been made. As they
          say, customer loyalty is the end-all-be-all of marketing.<br>
          <br>
          A company that utilizes customer ideas, feedbacks, and
          opinions can further satisfy customer needs and wants and thus
          facilitates goodwill in the blogging community. It is standard
          practice in blogging to provide a link to a thought originator
          which is important because backlinks are a method for search
          engines to rank a blog. Search engine ranking is very
          important. Google and Yahoo are two of the most popular search
          engines.<br>
          <br>
          A blog is typically written daily thus the blog post is new.
          The search engines index the new post more often than the
          regular website. The result is a high rank compared to a
          website. If a company has a product to promote and publishes
          blog posts about the product regularly, chances are one of the
          blog posts will be found by readers who may be looking for
          information about the product. <br>
          <br>
          Hopefully, after reading the blog post, the potential customer
          will visit the company website and make a purchase online or
          buy the product in a “brick and mortar” store. Marketers
          acknowledge that potential customers can be customers once
          they find the information they want about a product from the
          company’s blog.<br>
          <br>
          Another feature of a blog why search engines love it is a
          blog’s high number of incoming links. Bloggers link to other
          blogs, articles and websites. The reading audience is exposed
          to a plethora of information. Bloggers, thus, create and
          retain a loyal following of readers. PageRanks for blogs are
          usually very strong too. <br>
          <br>
          As you and I know, high search engine ranking translates to
          high traffic and more sales leads.<br>

    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          The way to get the most from blogging is by building a strong
          brand. A brand is simply value for the customer. It is good
          customer service and products or services that will satisfy
          customer needs and wants. <br>
          <br>
          A blog can help a company demonstrates its expertise in its
          industry or field. Blogs do create buzz about a company’s
          authority in its niche. A blog connects a company to its
          target audience and peers and starts a more dynamic
          conversation with the marketplace. <br>
          <br>
          A blog helps to show a company’s value, its online brand on
          the web. Once a company has built a strong brand, sales will
          just follow.<br>
          <br>
          Publishing a blog will not automatically generate higher
          sales. However, it is an efficient way to communicate with
          customers and prospects. A blog in itself is an excellent tool
          to support a business, provide value, build relationships and
          establish brand and image. <br>
          <br>
          The ultimate purpose of a blog is to brand, to communicate and
          to connect. Increased sales should only be viewed as a
          positive indirect effect of a successful blog.<br>
