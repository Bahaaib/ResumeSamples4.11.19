          There are several ways to monetize a blog. One of the most
          commonly used is by selling advertising space, either through
          text-based advertising or banner ads. But to do either of
          these, you will have to look for advertisers who will pay to
          have their ads placed on your web pages. If you're unsure on
          what to do and how to do it, here are tips to help you find
          blog advertisers to help you generate revenue with your
          website:<br>
          <br>
          Promote. Instead of just leaving possible banner ad locations
          blank, let advertisers know that they are up for grabs. Use
          'Advertise Here' or 'Your Ad Here' texts to indicate their
          availability.<br>
          <br>
          When advertisers click on these areas, they will arrive on a
          page where information about buying ad space will be provided.
          Make sure that there is a webpage that will be used for this
          purpose specifically. This page may either contain information
          about your terms or it could be a link that will allow your
          advertiser to send you an e-mail.<br>
          <br>
          Seek out advertisers actively. Other than openly promoting
          your blog for ads, you could also find blog advertisers by
          targeting them. That way, you get to choose who will place
          their ads on your blog. A standard letter of approach to
          advertisers should contain:<br>
          <br>
          - a brief introduction about yourself<br>
          <br>
          - a short explanation of the purpose of your e-mail<br>
          <br>
          - a short explanation why you're soliciting their sponsorship
          or ads<br>
          <br>
          - a concise explanation of the benefits of placing ads on your
          blog<br>
          <br>
          - details regarding your advertising terms (type of ad
          placements, industry to which your advertisers belong, maximum
          number of ads in one webpage, cost, method of payment, etc.)<br>
          <br>
          - important details about your site, such as your subject
          matter, audience, number of traffic, etc.<br>
          <br>
          Offer sponsorship. Blog sponsorships are fast becoming a trend
          online, as the number of businesses utilizing blogs as an
          extension of their marketing efforts increases. Through
          sponsorship, you will be working closely with a company (your
          advertiser) and promote their products and services through
          your blogs. Your web pages will also carry that company's
          name, brands and logo.<br>
          <br>
          You could also come up with a sponsorship deal wherein
          specific parts of your blog's content will be sponsored by the
          advertiser. This type of blog advertising works well if your
          site is quite popular already and has a considerable number of
          visitors.<br>
          <br>
          Do a keyword search. There are many companies and individuals
          using Google Adwords who might be interested in an arrangement
          with you. Do a simple keyword or key phrase search regarding
          major topics on your blog. Then seek out sponsored links and
          find out about the companies that pay for them. Get in touch
          with these people and offer your blog for their ads.<br>
          <br>
          Take advantage of links. Blogs and other sites that link with
          your blog are potential advertisers. If they find your blog
          interesting enough to link with, they might be open for
          negotiations regarding advertising. You might want to send
          them an e-mail to let them know your blog is available for
          advertising.<br>
          <br>
          Tap people who use your forums or leave messages. Another way
          to find blog advertisers is to offer your ad spots to people
          who leave comments or messages on your blogs. Seek out people
          affiliated with a company, group or association. They might be
          interested in buying ads on your blog.<br>
