          Today's software makes it so easy to set up a blog that it
          seems like everybody and their neighbor has a blog. Yes, they
          are a fad right now. And yes, they are a great business tool
          for any business, large or small – and they're here to stay.<br>
          <br>
          Especially for the independent professional, a blog is an easy
          communication tool to build credibility and trust. Most
          importantly, blogs make it easy for people to find you on the
          Web.<br>
          <br>
          But 9 out of 10 blogs created will be abandoned because they
          can take up a lot of time in a busy professional’s life, and
          results may not be evident right away.<br>
          <br>
          There are several keys to making your blog work for you,
          instead of the other way around. Once you learn and integrate
          these steps, it should take you only 10-20 minutes per post.
          It's recommended that an additional 20 minutes a couple of
          times per week should be spent reading and commenting on other
          blogs and sites on the Web so you can bring valuable
          information to your readers.<br>

          1. Write valuable content and share stories to showcase your
          knowledge and expertise. Don’t forget to explain how you work
          with clients and let readers know how to contact you, hire
          you, buy a product or register for your services.<br>
          <br>
          2. Write 2-3 times a week, short articles of 250-350 words
          each time. Occasionally, a longer article can be shared, using
          the extended post feature.<br>
          <br>
          3. Link profusely to other resources on the web. This is
          essential for building traffic and enlarging your reading
          audience. Spend some time, 2-3 times a week researching your
          area of expertise on the Web. Leave comments on other blogs.<br>
          <br>
          4. Submit to blog directories and ping each time you post. If
          you don’t know how to do this, get a blog coach or buy and
          read an instructional manual.<br>
          <br>
          5. Track and monitor your visitor stats. Install a counter on
          your blog so you know what’s happening. For example, a free
          counter can be found at www.Statcounter.com.<br>
          <br>
          6. List all your products and affiliate products and make sure
          you have the landing pages properly linked. Use your affiliate
          links and ad-tracking features if you have a shopping cart.<br>
          <br>
          7. Don’t forget to link to your own website and vice versa.
          This is one reason we prefer to have the blog separate from
          your website, rather than installing blog software
          incorporated into your website. It’s like having two fishing
          poles in the pond.<br>
          <br>
          Like any marketing effort, persistence pays off. In six months
          of regular blogging, assuming you are providing valuable
          content, you should see a significant increase in your web
          site traffic, the client leads, and overall total revenue for
          your business.<br>
          <br>
          If not, you’re not blogging smart!<br>
