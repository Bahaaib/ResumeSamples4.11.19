          Your blog is a very powerful tool that can help you express
          yourself to the world. You gradually build up a relationship
          with those people who read your blog. While your blog may
          already be effective, there are a few things you cna do to
          ensure that both you and your readers continue to enjoy your
          blog.<br>
          <br>
          First of all, post often and on time. If you post a blog
          called "Monday Musings", readers will expect to see new posts
          on Monday, especially if you start out that way. Your blog is
          similar to a newsletter and it is important to be consistent
          with it. This will help increase the number of people who
          visit your site and return for a repeat viewing. When readers
          are interested and come back frequently, you are able to
          eventually build up a relationship with those regular readers.<br>
          <br>
          Secondly, it is ok to use information from other sources, but
          be sure to give appropriate credit to those sources. You may
          want to comment on a news story you found or a particular
          website that you found of interest. Just be sure to provide
          the source information and a link at the end of your post, if
          available.<br>
          <br>
          Next, remember that your blog is a great place to give props
          to other bloggers. You can highlight featured bloggers and
          provide a link for your readers to check out that blog. This
          gives you the opportunity to network with other bloggers and
          offer your readers a complete experience by providing
          additional good information to them.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, it is essential that you take care in setting
          your blog up so that it is easy to read and easy to navigate.
          Readers often want to be able to find past postings and want
          to see how you organize your thoughts. You can list past
          postings by placing them down the side of your page or by
          placing links to them in current blogs to which they relate.<br>
          <br>
          It is also helpful to separate your postings into topics if
          this makes sense for your blog. It makes it easier for readers
          to find several posts on a particular topic and will not tie
          them down. Making information easily accessible is a great way
          to ensure ease for readers and make them come back again and
          again. Having a search function available is another way to
          gain repeat readers.<br>
          <br>
          Arrange postings so that the more recent ones appear the the
          top of your page or on the first page of your site. This
          allows readers to quickly see the topic(s) for that day and
          showcase your newest postings first.<br>
          <br>
          Besides just the layout of your blog, it is important to
          include relevant and accurate content. Double check anything
          that you are not sure of and only post what you know to be
          true without a disclaimer. Being honest and printing only the
          truth will help to enforce the validity and credibility of
          your blog.<br>
          <br>
          On the same token, respect the privacy of others. Never rent
          or sell the email addresses of your readers to other sources.
          If a third party wants to be promoted to your group of
          readers, you should be the one to promote it via your blog and
          not by discrespecting the privacy of others, which they have
          entrusted to you. In addition, do not use names of individuals
          in your postings unless you have received their permission
          first. When it comes to businesses, take care to only post if
          appropriate.<br>
          <br>
          Finally, you have to make readers want to come back to read
          your blog again. Readers want personality and human emotion to
          be evident in what they read, so find ways to connect yourself
          to the readers.<br>
          <br>
          Blogging can be fun and rewarding, as long as you put forth
          the effort to make it so. It is a flexible hobby or business,
          but you should always follow the basic rules to ensure that
          visitors are always amazed at the freshness of your blogs.
          Research additional techniques that other great blogs use, and
          come up with your own tactics to make your blog the best!<br>
