    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          One of the most serious problems with any blogging system,
          including WordPress, is that the comments area is wide open to
          that scourge of the Internet, spammers. In this case, it's
          comment spam.<br>
          <br>
          Comment spam is created by people seeking to boost their
          Google rankings by having lots of links pointing to their own
          websites. This causes a wide variety of problems:<br>
          <br>
          • When Google detects content spam, they will often block the
          site it's coming from because it messes up their ranking
          system.<br>
          <br>
          • It takes up your valuable time and bandwidth to eliminate
          these posts.<br>
          <br>
          • If the onslaught of spam is heavy enough, it may result in a
          denial-of-service attack, intended or not, which is a
          situation in which the server tries so hard to post bad
          information and/or deliver notification emails to you that it
          denies service to the legitimate requests. In at least one
          case, a blogger received over two thousand email notifications
          of comments that needed approval; as he dealt with these, he
          continued getting more, ultimately crashing his mail server.<br>
          <br>
          As you can see, even if you have your comments set to post
          only upon approval, this can be a serious problem. One
          solution is the Akismet plugin for WordPress.<br>
          <br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Akismet Plugin and Other Plugin Options for
              WordPress</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Akismet is designed to help you filter out those nasty
          spammers, and it's not hard to get it installed into your
          WordPress system. Download the plugin, and upload it to the
          blog directory on your server in the plugins subdirectory
          under wp-content. Activate from the WordPress plugins menu. If
          you have a notice that you need the Akismet API, go to the
          WordPress website and look or ask for one.<br>
          <br>
          Here's the magic: the only instruction in Akismet is "forget
          that spam was ever a problem." You don't have to do anything
          else at all – the spam will simply be bounced. You will not
          receive a notification, nor will you have to go out and delete
          spam.<br>
          <br>
          Another plugin for eliminating spam from bots is the "Did You
          Pass Math" plugin. This one makes the user perform a simple
          math problem before submitting a comment. As most humans can
          handle this and most spambots can't, it's pretty likely that a
          comment posted through this is a legitimate comment. You
          should add a note of caution that your comments will be
          deleted if you answer the math wrong, though; a wise commenter
          will use an offline composition tool, not post directly to the
          comments area.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>If This Still Doesn't Work</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          If you still can't eliminate spammers with these plugins, you
          can eliminate them by denying them access to your comments
          area. This does not mean you have to disable your comments
          section, only that you need to set up a filter.<br>
          <br>
          It's not usually as simple as just blocking their IPs. Serious
          spammers use random IPs, while blocking IPs may get rid of
          them for a short time, it will ultimately prevent legitimate
          comments from being posted. Spammers are also notorious for
          hijacking other people's IP addresses. But as a short-term
          emergency solution, you can try it. The IP address is included
          in the information packet for the comment; it's similar to a
          traceable phone number. Look for clear patterns in your IP
          numbers.<br>
          <br>
          Use the .htaccess file to block unwanted IPs from even seeing
          your blog. For instance, these lines can be added:<br>
          <br>
          order allow,deny<br>
          deny from 123.123.123.123<br>
          deny from 456.456.456.*<br>
          deny from 789.789.*.*<br>
          allow from all<br>
          <br>
          IPs are four-part numbers, such as 192.168.0.1. Typically, if
          you see a pattern with the first two sections being identical,
          you can block all IPs of that type by simply listing them as
          192.168.*.*, as you see above. This screens out all these IP
          numbers. Blocked IPs will get a 403 error page; customize
          yours so that your contact details are listed in case you're
          blocking out a legitimate user. Don't use your regular email;
          a spammer can harvest that too, for a whole new set of
          problems. Instead, encode your email so that it's not
          automatically readable.<br>
          <br>
          When you think you have your problems addressed, you can
          remove the block from your .htaccess file. If it still doesn't
          work, or if you don't see an IP pattern, it's likely that
          spambots are hijacking someone else's machine to attack your
          site. In this case, do not use the IP block.<br>
          <br>
          Again, if you don't have an IP pattern of attack, this may not
          be worth doing. Remember, too, that with IP addresses, the
          first numbers affect the largest number of computers, like a
          reverse address: USA, California, Sacramento, X Building, Ste.
          101, Joe Schmo. An IP follows roughly the same pattern, with
          the last of the four sections referring to the specific
          computer it is attached to.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Google's Nofollow Attribute</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Of course, if it's a waste of their time to spam you, spammers
          may just skip you altogether. For this reason, you can use the
          Google Nofollow attribute for links: . This attribute is
          embedded automatically by modern versions of WordPress.<br>
          <br>
          It does not eliminate links, which is what spammers are
          working on adding to your site. Instead, it makes those links
          irrelevant to Google. The end result is that it doesn't hurt
          your rank in Google, and it doesn't help a spammer to send
          data to your site. It also marks you, for spambots looking for
          an easy target, as a waste of time.<br>
          <br>
          This is not an immediate fix. But it is a way to make your
          blog resistant to spammers in the future. If you're already a
          target, you'll have to work with it slowly, incorporating all
          these fixes. If you aren't a target, the very least you should
          do is turn on the nofollow option in your WordPress system;
          this will deter any hungry spambots. Upgrade your version, or
          look for one of the plugins that provides this service for
          you.<br>
