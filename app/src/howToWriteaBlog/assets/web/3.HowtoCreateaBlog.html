          <b>Step 1: Choose Your Passion</b><br>
          <br>
          What does passion have to do with it? I just want to make
          money!<br>
          <br>
          Well making money might be a good reason for starting a blog
          and money CAN be made, but in the end creating and maintaining
          a blog that is going to last is more about your passion or
          your driving force. Ask yourself this question:<br>
          <br>
          "What would I do everyday, for the rest of my life, without
          ever being paid to do it?"<br>
          <br>
          Whatever answer you come up with is your passion. That is what
          your blog should be about; your passion. That is what you
          should be blogging about. Write for yourself before you right
          for someone else. Money and fame are just icing on the cake.<br>
          <br>
          See, when you first start writing your blog, there most likely
          will not be any money returned from your time investment.
          Making money is usually a result of long hours invested in
          gaining subscribers and avid readers and becoming known as an
          "expert". You might decide to monetize your blog, but without
          people reading your blog, how are you going to make money?<br>
          <br>
          Remember this: there are no get-rich-quick schemes related to
          building an a+ blog!!! Sorry to dash your dreams but if you
          are looking for the "key" to riches beyond your wildest
          dreams, then please go somewhere else; you won't find it here.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 2: Write Down Your Goals</b><br>
          <br>
          Most likely if you write down your goals those goals will
          happen. This is because making yourself actually think about
          what you want to accomplish is half of the battle already won.
          "Failing to Plan is Planning to Fail." ~ English Proverb What
          do you want to accomplish? How are you going to deliver your
          message? When you are finished, what is it going to look like?<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 3: Visit Some Other Blogs</b><br>
          <br>
          Do some research and check out what other people are doing
          with their blogs. Learn what blogging is in general. Don't
          just search for blogs in your niche, but also in general.
          There is a lot to be learned from others that have already put
          up there own blogs. Posts some comments so that you can start
          to get a feel of what the whole blogging process is. While you
          are researching be sure to bookmark those blogs that you have
          visited and write down interesting ideas that pop into your
          head. You might not remember where you have been only a day or
          two earlier.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 4: Choose a Blogging Software</b><br>
          <br>
          There a bunch of options when looking for your blogging
          software. I would start by doing a search on Google for
          Blogging Software. Don't be intimidated by the 62,000,000 +
          results returned back to you. :)<br>
          <br>
          For the scope of the article, I am going to talk about
          WordPress (WordPress.com). I chose WordPress for my blog not
          only because it is the most popular, but also because it is
          backed by a huge community, has some really useful plugins,
          gives you loads of control and is easy to use. You can either
          signup for at WordPress or find your own hosting provider to
          host the blog for you. If you are new to blogging then
          signing-up at WordPress might be your best bet. There are many
          of bulit-in extras like stats that track your visitors that
          are beneficial. Best of all it is FREE!<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Step 5: Buy a Domain Name</b><br>
          <br>
          Buying a domain from a domain registry such as GoDaddy will
          make your blog appear more professional. Choose a domain name
          that not only fits your blog's purpose but also has keywords
          in it. For instance, if your blog is about gardening, then
          choose a domain such as "MyGardeningBlog.com" or
          "My-Gardening-Blog.com". The .com, .net, .org, etc extension
          is not important although .com extensions are generally
          recognized as the default.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 6: Customize Your Blog</b><br>
          <br>
          Customizing your blog is very easy with WordPress. If you
          choose to host your blog with WordPress then you can choose
          from dozens of pre-installed templates. You can also Search
          Google for additional templates that are either free or low
          cost for around $45 a template. If you find a template that is
          not provided by the hosted service then you can simply upload
          the new template to your account. The control panel that comes
          with the hosted service is very easy to use.<br>
          <br>
          If you are daring enough to modify the template by hand you
          can do so. WordPress is built in a web site scripting language
          called PHP. If you are not familiar with PHP then this route
          is not for you. You can, however, find additional resources
          online either at the WordPress website or by doing a Google
          search.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 7: Install Helpful Plugins</b><br>
          <br>
          WordPress is easily expandable by the use of "Plugins".
          Plugins are little pieces of software that are created by a
          3rd-Party developer that accomplish simple tasks such as
          helping you manage your Google AdSense (Google.com/AdSense)
          ads or backing up your WordPress installation. There are many
          plugins to choose from and you can search for them at
          WordPress.org.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 8: Write Your "About" Page</b><br>
          <br>
          When you are ready, you can describe the blog and its purpose
          in an "About" page. Be as descriptive as you can about the
          target audience and what you will be providing in the blog.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Step 9: Start Posting to Your Blog</b><br>
          <br>
          This is actually the hardest part. If you have done your
          homework on what your passion was and you did some research,
          then you most likely did some blog posts in your head. Don't
          sweat coming up with great and astounding ideas or intricate
          essays. Remember the KISS method and Keep It Simple Stupid!
          (OK I had to break this rule for this article but you know
          what I mean...)<br>
          <br>
          You have to remember who your audience is in general. Most
          people read blogs rather than other forms of information
          because they are short and to-the-point snippets of
          information that can be easily digested. I think this is just
          normal human behavior in a conventional society. There is far
          too much information on the internet and too little time to
          try to consume it all. Blogs satisfy our normal curiosity like
          small little squares of chocolate would satisfy our
          sweet-tooth.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Step 10: Marketing (and maybe Monetizing) Your Blog</b><br>
          <br>
          Since you have been blogging your little heart away, wouldn't
          it be nice if people actually read it? Here are a few ways,
          among many, to go about marketing your blog.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Google Website Submittal </b>(
          http://www.google.com/addurl) - This allows you to easily add
          your new blog (or website) to Google. I also suggest you
          submit to Yahoo and AltaVista and any other search engine or
          directory you can find. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Google AdSense and AdWords</b> - AdWords allows you to
          advertise on Google and AdSense allows you display ads on your
          blog that match your content. If any visitors to your blog
          click on the advertisements you get paid for it. What a
          concept!! Be sure to check the other suggested affiliates and
          ad networks under the "Money Makers" section of this blog. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Google Sitemap</b> - This is a free plugin for WordPress
          that you can install that will create a Google Sitemap of your
          blog that can be used to allow your blog to be better indexed
          by Google. <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>FeedBurner </b>- Another plugin and service that is
          free that allows you to do some really neat things with your
          blog's feed. The feed of your blog is what allows someone to
          subscribe to your blog. It is a file that contains all of your
          posts in a specific file format called RSS that an
          "aggregator" (or "feed reader") such as Google Reader can read
          and keep track of. <br>
          <br>
          You would want to use an aggregator because it keeps track of
          the different blog feeds that you have subscribed to and
          allows you to read those blog feeds all in one place. Although
          you do not need FeedBurner to allow your blog to be subscribed
          to, it has some really great features that you need to check
          out. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Comments</b> - Visit a lot of blogs and subscribe to them.
          Try to be the first to leave a comment with a link back to
          your blog. <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Forums</b> - Forums are the same way. Just be careful
          that you are truly leaving a comment about the thread and not
          just trying to advertise your blog. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Signatures </b>- When you leave a comment or send an email
          make sure you use a signature that has your blog address.
          Write Articles - Turn you blog posts into an expanded article
          that you can put on a tutorial or eZine (Electronic or Online
          Magazine) website such as EzineArticles.com. Make sure to add
          a link back to your blog. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Word of Mouth</b> - Don't forget to tell the people you
          know about your new blog and keep them updated on what is
          going on. Ask them to become subscribers to your blog. <br>
          <br>
          <b>Social Networks</b> - If you have an account with a social
          networking website such as LinkedIn, Facebook or Twitter you
          can setup your account to subscribe to your blog
          automatically.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
