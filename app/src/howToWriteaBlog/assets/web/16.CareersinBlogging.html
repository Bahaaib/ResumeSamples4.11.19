          Many freelance writers are beginning to find blogging is one
          of the newest career opportunities available to them. Blogging
          is essentially a series of postings on a particular subject
          which are listed in reverse chronological order. These blogs
          may be about a variety of different subjects and may be
          personal, political, informative, humorous or any other
          category desired by the blogger. <br>
          <br>
          However, the key to a successful blog is a blog which pertains
          to a subject which appeals to a wide audience. Additionally
          the blog should be updated regularly and should provide useful
          content to the readers of the blog. This article will provide
          some information on finding career opportunities in blogging,
          will discuss the benefits of this type of career and will
          provide information on how writers can manage a blog
          successfully.<br>

          </b><b>Finding Blogging Career Opportunities</b><br>
          <br>
          Although blogging career opportunities are becoming
          increasingly popular, many writers are not aware of how to
          find these wonderful opportunities. These career opportunities
          may be offered as ghost writing positions or as positions
          offering a byline to the writer and finding these blogging
          opportunities is often very similar to finding any other
          career opportunities for writers. <br>
          <br>
          Companies seeking a blogger may post the job opening in the
          same manner in which they would post other openings with the
          company such as accounting positions or administrative
          positions. Therefore, writers interested in a position as a
          blogger should utilize the same job search websites they rely
          on to find other career opportunities.<br>
          <br>
          Bloggers may also wish to visit career websites and message
          boards which focus exclusively on careers in blogging. The
          ProBlogger.net website is just one example of a website
          dedicated exclusively to putting bloggers in connection with
          those who are interested in hiring a writer for a particular
          blog. <br>
          <br>
          Interested bloggers should also consider joining message
          boards for those who blog for a living. This can be beneficial
          because here bloggers are likely to share information
          regarding the companies for which they work as well as any
          information they have about companies who are currently
          looking to hire bloggers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Benefits of a Career in Blogging</b><br>
          <br>
          There are many benefits to pursuing a career in blogging.
          Perhaps one of the most alluring benefits to a career in
          blogging is the work can typically be done as a telecommute
          position. This is because as long as the blogger has access to
          the software necessary to write and upload a blog, there is no
          need for the blogger to perform the work from a specific
          location. This means the blogger can reside virtually anywhere
          in the world and can likely perform the necessary work from
          his own home. <br>
          <br>
          However, not all blogging positions are telecommute positions.
          Some companies may require bloggers to perform the work onsite
          as a matter of personal preference.<br>
          <br>
          Another benefit to a career in blogging is the ability to
          accomplish work at a pace which his convenient to the blogger.
          The blogger may be required to upload a new post to the blog
          according to a regular schedule but the actually writing of
          the posts can be accomplished when it is convenient for the
          blogger. <br>
          <br>
          Many blogging software packages enable the blogger to set a
          specific time for a specific post to be uploaded. This allows
          the blogger to write several posts at a time and have them
          publish according to a pre-determined schedule.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Finding Time to Blog</b><br>
          <br>
          One of the problems which many bloggers face is finding the
          time to blog. This is especially difficult if the blogger
          maintains several blogs or if the blogger maintains a current
          events blog in which posts must be timely in order to be
          relevant and of interest to the readers. <br>
          <br>
          Writing blog posts in batches and scheduling them to publish
          as needed is one way to deal with managing several blogs.
          However, writers of blogs related to current events must take
          special care to budget their time wisely to ensure they are
          publishing topical blog posts. One way this can be
          accomplished is by setting aside time daily to reading current
          events to derive inspiration and then scheduling time after
          that to write and publish the blog. <br>
          <br>
          For example, a blogger with a current events blog might choose
          to review the previous dayâ€™s news the first thing in the
          morning to ensure they are reviewing all of the relevant news
          from the previous day before writing the blog post.<br>
