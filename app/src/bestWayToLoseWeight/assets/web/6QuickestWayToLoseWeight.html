<body><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Quickest Way To Lose Weight</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I
guess I'm one of those people who isn't that good at only thinking
about the short term. I tend to think more long term and that includes
when I'm considering what is the quickest way to lose weight. Whatever
type of weight loss plan I decide on must not be bad for my overall,
long term health or I won't do it.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">That
is what I recommend for you too. Today we know a lot more about the
effects of some of these diets and supplements over the long haul. In
my opinion, it's not worth dying over 10 extra pounds.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
it comes to the quickest way to lose weight I prefer to balance the
speed of the weight loss with my overall health. I will force myself to
be more patient and take a little longer so that the results I get are
better for my body.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To
that end, you should talk to your doctor before you start any type of
weight loss plan. Whether you are focusing primarily on your eating
plan, your exercise plan, or the best option, a combination of both,
getting the approval of your doctor before you start is just the smart
thing to do.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I've
never been much of a fan of taking a supplement. Why? Simple, it's
short term. For the most part, you aren't going to be taking
supplements for the rest of your life and if all&nbsp; your weight loss
hinges on that pill, what will happen when you stop taking it?</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Instead,
if I use a supplement at all, I use it with the idea that it is for
short term use only and it is only a way to help me get off to a quick
start with my weight loss.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I
know from personal experience that it's much easier to stick with a
weight loss plan as soon as you start to see some results. Using a
supplement for a short term, until you start seeing some results, can
be a great way to keep yourself motivated.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Another
thing I try to do is make sure I am drinking enough water. Again, talk
to your doctor to find out how much you should be drinking (believe it
or not, you can do harm if you drink too much water too).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I've
been told that most people should drink half of their body weight in
ounces of water every day. So, if you weigh 150 lbs. you should drink
75 ounces of water daily (75 is half of 150).</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
absolute best thing I did to lose weight, and I lost it in one week
too, was to eat more. Sounds weird, doesn't it? But I found that when I
ate 6 small, but nutritious, meals daily I lost weight with out really
trying.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I
lost 6 pounds in that first week. I just ate small meals consisting of
lean protein, fresh vegetables and a little bit of carbs. At that time
I wasn't even exercising that much.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
reason this worked so well is easy: I was providing my body with the
fuel it needed to run at it's very best. When you give your body what
it needs, you will almost always see it runs efficiently and that means
it will burn more fat.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">I find that the quickest way to lose weight is when you work with your body instead of against it.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></body></html>
