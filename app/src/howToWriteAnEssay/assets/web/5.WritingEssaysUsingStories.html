            Essays - Using Stories to Support Your Thesis</big></b><br>

        Once you've come up with a great thesis for your essay, you need
        to give it credibility by supporting it thoroughly with -<br>
        <br>
        stories<br>
        examples<br>
        reasoning<br>
        <br>
        You see, it won't matter much that you've got a fantastic thesis
        if you've got lousy support for it in the form of thinly
        developed stories, weakly described examples, and faulty
        reasoning. If that's the case, then you'll be lucky to get a
        grade of C on your essay!<br>
        <br>
        Let's talk about stories, and what makes good story support for
        your essays. To help us, we'll use the memorable story of
        Archimedes in Isaac Asimov's lively essay, "The Eureka
        Phenomenon," as our example (to access Asimov's essay, type "The
        Eureka Phenomenon" at Google Search).<br>
        <br>
        "The Eureka Phenomenon"<br>
        <br>
        Before we start, let's review the beginning of the historically
        real story about Archimedes in Asimov's essay.<br>
        <br>
        Archimedes lives in the city of Sparta, Greece, circa 250 B.C.
        His cousin, Hieron, is the king of Sparta. Now, Hieron has given
        a goldsmith a certain amount of gold to make a beautiful new
        crown, and the goldsmith returned a beautiful golden crown to
        him, which the king loved. But Hieron doesn't trust the
        goldsmith, thinking the artist may have pocketed some of the
        gold and substituted another element into the crown so it weighs
        the same as if all the gold were there. He calls for Archimedes
        and asks him to determine whether the beautiful crown is, in
        fact, pure gold.<br>
        <br>
        Now, Archimedes makes a statement about what is already familiar
        to scientists, that is, that the crown would have to be melted
        down to get Hieron's answer. But the king doesn't want to
        destroy his beautiful new crown, so he provides the old view
        strong value statement when he orders Archimedes to solve 'The
        Problem' without melting down his new crown:<br>
        <br>
        Archimedes would have had to say, "There is no known way, sire,
        to carry through a nondestructive determination of volume."
        "Then think of one," said Hieron testily.<br>
        <br>
        Archimedes then worked hard on The Problem until he was "worn
        out with thinking."<br>
        <br>
        Now let's get into our discussion on how to use stories to
        support your essay's thesis.<br>
        <br>
        There are three must-have qualities for good stories used in
        essays:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        STRUCTURE: beginning, middle, ending<br>
        PROGRESS: from old view to new view<br>
        IMAGE: vivid, emotional, memorable, symbolic<br>
        <br>
        STRUCTURE-Beginning, middle, ending <br>
        <br>
        To be a quality story, a story must have, like the Archimedes
        story, a clear structure of:<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        a beginning,<br>
        a middle, and<br>
        an ending<br>
        <br>
        Beginning-The beginning of a story sets up an old view strong
        value statement either by, about, or relating directly to, the
        main character.<br>
        <br>
        Middle-The middle of a good story changes scene and connects the
        old view value statement with some sort of action to the new
        view reverse at the ending.<br>
        <br>
        In the Archimedes story, the middle scene has changed to
        Sparta's public baths, which is just a temporary resting place
        so Archimedes can take up The Problem again with more energy,
        after bathing and relaxing. In Asimov's version of this
        historical story, Archimedes settles down into a bathtub,
        splashing around a bit. Eventually, he notices that the
        attendant is pouring water into his bathtub and that when he
        submerges his foot and leg, water slops out of the bathtub.<br>
        <br>
        Ending-The ending of a good story changes scene from the middle
        and completes the search or quest involving the old view strong
        value statement by supplying a new view reverse.<br>
        <br>
        In this story, Archimedes jumps up out of his bathtub and runs
        naked through the streets, excitedly yelling, "Eureka! Eureka!"
        ("I've got it! I've got it!"). He has reversed the old view
        problem introduced at the beginning, "no known way... think of
        one" by finding the answer.<br>
        <br>
        Archimedes's excitement and running also reverse the negative
        old view value of the king's testiness and even of Archimedes
        being worn out at the beginning.<br>
        <br>
        PROGRESS: from an old view to a new view. <br>
        <br>
        The Archimedes story shows-<br>
        <br>
        changes of the action from an old view to a new view<br>
        <br>
        All the action of the beginning, middle, and ending scenes are
        related directly or indirectly to one thing in this story:
        solving The Problem that has been worrying King Hieron. The
        Problem, of course, has the closely associated old view that
        there is "no known" solution to it and that the king feels
        strongly, testy, about getting the kind of solution he wants,
        that is, without melting down his beautiful new crown.<br>
        <br>
        Note the progression in relation to The Oldview Problem:<br>
        <br>
        FROM serious about &amp; "worn out" on The Old View Problem<br>
        <br>
        TO relaxing to renew energy to work again on The Old View
        Problem<br>
        <br>
        TO excited about having solved/reversed The Old View Problem<br>
        <br>
        What started as a hard, worrisome, work-til-you're-worn-out old
        view kind of value and problem ends as an easy new view
        solution, arrived at by the easy, involuntary method of relaxed
        thinking-Asimov's new view reverse-not by the old view method of
        hard, rigorous, continuous thinking.<br>
        <br>
        IMAGE: vivid, emotional, memorable, symbolic. <br>
        <br>
        The Archimedes story also provides a -<br>
        <br>
        vivid, emotional, memorable, and symbolic image<br>
        <br>
        Vivid-Definitions of vivid use the words very, lively, strong,
        sharp, intense. So a vivid image would have details that embody
        or show liveliness, strength, sharpness, intensity-in short, an
        extremity. For instance, Asimov might have described Archimedes
        as "running swift as a deer in his excitement, bounding lightly
        and very easily over stone benches and other obstacles in his
        way, seemingly inexhaustible as he ran all the way back home to
        King Hieron with the good news."<br>
        <br>
        That would have been vivid, yes-but Asimov doesn't do that, does
        he?<br>
        <br>
        Asimov actually gives no description at all of Archimedes
        running naked through the streets of the city, yelling, "Eureka!
        Eureka!" Here's all Asimov says about that extreme, striking
        image of Archimedes:<br>
        <br>
        Jumping out of the bath, he proceeded to run home at top speed
        through the streets of Syracuse. He did not bother to put on his
        clothes... And as he ran, Archimedes shouted over and over,
        "I've got it! I've got it!"<br>
        <br>
        What are some familiar things that most people in our culture
        are familiar with that you can merely name and they'll have a
        vivid mental image? Here's a short list, and I'm sure you can
        improve on it for possible readers in the groups you belong to,
        such as your school, family, friends, clubs, organizations, and
        work:<br>
        <br>
        McDonalds (golden double arches; Ronald McDonald)<br>
        7-11 stores (slushy machines; hamburger &amp; hot dog counter)<br>
        Washington Monument (500' high obelisk in Washington D.C.)<br>
        Michael Jackson (moonwalk; silver glove)<br>
        our national flag (red, white, and blue)<br>
        <br>
        So you can describe an image with hardly any details if you
        merely suggest something your readers are very familiar with-in
        this case, being naked and running and shouting-and couple it
        with a context of excitement and emotion, as Asimov did.<br>
        <br>
        Emotional-When people think of Asimov's essay, that image-with
        no details supplied by Asimov, mind you-springs to mind and it's
        coupled with a feeling, an emotion.<br>
        <br>
        Why? Because running through the streets naked in our culture
        would be embarrassing, and we feel at least a little of that
        embarrassment as we read the story, as if we were there,
        watching Archimedes run naked through the streets. As if we were
        there, emotionally interacting-that's the key.<br>
        <br>
        Readers can't help but identify emotionally with the people, the
        actions, and the things you present in writing, even in an
        essay. So when you're describing something, use words that
        suggest or even directly describe emotions. Just because you're
        writing an essay doesn't mean you have to leave emotions out of
        it-that's a mistake.<br>
        <br>
        Memorable-That embarrassment I mentioned also carries with it
        amusement, which makes the image even more lively and intense,
        and therefore memorable.<br>
        <br>
        Using a few well-chosen, emotionally laden words increases the
        likelihood that your readers will interact with your words,
        ideas, thoughts, reasoning. And through interacting, they will
        remember.<br>
        <br>
        Since the reader is a learner, then you want them to remember
        the main points of what you say in your essay, right? Then use a
        few-not a lot, mind you-emotionally laden words in the
        mini-stories within your essays that get your readers to
        interact emotionally and therefore help them more easily
        remember your ideas.<br>
        <br>
        Those three features-<br>
        <br>
        describing lively, strong images or suggesting familiar images
        that encourage your readers to supply the intense details,<br>
        attaching or suggesting an emotion of some kind along with it,<br>
        provoking the reader's mental interaction with the image in some
        way to make it memorable<br>
        <br>
        -are the key ingredients for a successful image, whether it's in
        a story or not. When you get the reader's mind involved with
        lively, familiar images and stimulate emotional feeling as well
        and provoke interaction that makes remembering it easy, then you
        are truly helping readers to learn and remember the new view you
        are sharing with them.<br>
        <br>
        Symbolic-Even more than all the above, though, the "Eureka!"
        image represents and symbolizesthe new view reverse of the
        essay, in this way-<br>
        <br>
        The old view was the tedious plodding of scientific voluntary
        thought, with its meticulous working out of consequences from
        assumptions- it was the mostly unstated, implied 'restrictive
        clothing' of thought.<br>
        <br>
        That plodding, scientific old view is reversed by the new view
        symbol of Archimedes as the swift, smooth running of involuntary
        thought without the restrictions of the 'clothing' of methodical
        scientific thought.<br>
        <br>
        That's the power of a great image-you can use it in an essay to
        capture a new view vividly, emotionally, memorably, and
        symbolically.<br>
        <br>
        Conclusion<br>
        <br>
        The stories you use in your essays won't be as long as Asimov's
        story about Archimedes. They will be much shorter, but they
        still should have the same qualities of Structure, Progress, and
        Image that Asimov gave his story.<br>
        <br>
        You can see a much shorter story with all those qualities in
        Carl Sagan's fascinating essay, The Abstraction of Beasts (to
        access it, type "The Abstraction of Beasts" at Google Search).
        Look for the three short paragraphs and just fourteen sentences
        that he uses to tell a very brief, but very good, story about
        Helen Keller.<br>
        <br>
        You won't be able to forget the image he shares. Why? Because
        Sagan follows all the rules I've shared with you here about
        Structure, Progress, and Image.<br>
