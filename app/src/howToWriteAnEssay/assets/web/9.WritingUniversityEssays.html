          Essays - How to Conduct Your Research Properly</big></b><br>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do you
      ever have any of these problems?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Have
      you ever started to write an essay and found that you were staring
      at a
      blank screen and a flashing cursor? Did you feel like you were
      starting
      from scratch?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Have
      you ever started writing an essay and found that you could not
      remember
      some of the information you read? Or tried to put a reference in
      and
      could not find the page number of the quotation you were using?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Is
      your research usually scattered all over the place, in the form of
      books, photocopied pages, bookmarked websites and some notes? Do
      you
      find it hard to create an essay out of disorganised research?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you
      answered yes to any of these questions, then learning how to
      create and
      use a research document can help! If you organise and record your
      research properly, you should never have any of these problems
      again.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How
      can you organise your research?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your
      research should be organised so that the transition from doing
      your
      research to writing your essay is simple. The best way to do this
      is to
      organise your research so that it matches the organisation of the
      essay. In Step 2 of writing an academic essay, you would have
      written a
      rough essay plan before you began your research. This essay plan
      is the
      guide you need to use to organise your research.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Copy
      and paste this essay plan into a Word document. All your research
      for
      this essay will be recorded in this one document. Use each of the
      dot
      points from your essay plan (topics you are planning to discuss)
      as a
      heading in your research document. When you do your research, you
      will
      organise it in the order that the information will appear in your
      essay. Doing this means you will be organising your research by
      theme
      or topic, not by source.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
      means that you will not simply record all the information from one
      source together and then go on to type up the information from
      your
      next source underneath it. If you do things that way, you would
      need to
      go back and re-organise your research later, into the correct
      order for
      your essay. That would be a waste of your time.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Why
      should you record your research (instead of just reading or taking
      a
      few notes)?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you
      do not record your research properly, you can spend hours, days or
      weeks doing research, and then when you start to write your essay
      you
      will find that you have to go back and re-do things, like search
      for
      page numbers or correct quotations. You must record your research
      in a
      way that makes essay writing easier for you. It should be
      accurate,
      include all the information you need, and give you a chance to
      record
      your own ideas and thoughts on the material you are reading as you
      go
      along. Do not leave this until the end.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Instead
      of just taking notes when researching, a better and more efficient
      way
      to research is to critically arrange and organise material by
      typing
      out all the important information you find. You do not need to
      type out
      everything, just the critical, relevant and important information
      for
      your essay. Then you can add your own notes. (Make sure you use
      punctuation marks so you can see what is a quotation and what are
      your
      own words.)</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There
      are a few important reasons for why it is better to type out
      sources
      word for word in your research rather than only take notes.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">1. You
      do not have to remember everything you have written, all the
      important
      material is written down.
      <br>
      2. When you begin writing your essay you will have all information
      you
      need to make accurate direct quotations. <br>
      3. You will not make the mistake of writing something in your
      essay
      that you think you have thought of yourself, but is in fact
      something
      you are remembering from a book word-for-word. <br>
      4. You still have the opportunity to write your own notes about
      the
      sources as you go along, and develop your own ideas. But you will
      do
      this in a way that makes it clear what is from the book, and what
      are
      your own ideas.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How
      should you record your research?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
      must record the following information from your sources:</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">1.
      Reference information about the source you are using
      <br>
      2. The subject or topic of each paragraph you type out (to help
      organise your ideas)
      <br>
      3. The exact wording of the source (using punctuation marks to
      show you
      are quoting)
      <br>
      4. The page number of the information you are typing up
      <br>
      5. Your own ideas and thoughts about the material you are reading</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While
      you are doing all this, you can be working on your reference list
      at
      the same time. Each time you begin reading a source, type up all
      reference information into your reference list straight away. One
      good
      way of setting out your research is as follows:</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
      topic/subject of the paragraph
      <br>
      'The exact wording of the source/paragraph that you are typing up
      goes
      here, using punctuation marks so you can see that you are quoting'
      (Put
      the reference information here, the way you would in an in-text
      reference: Surname, Year, Page number).
      <br>
      [Your notes and ideas go here. Your own words go in square
      brackets and
      do not have punctuation marks, so you can easily see what are your
      own
      words and what words come from the source.]</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">So for
      example:</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
      number of people killed during the Spanish Civil War
      <br>
      'The number of people killed during the Spanish Civil War is very
      difficult to ascertain. It was probably over one million people.
      Many
      people went "missing" and were never found' (Nash, 1989, p. 61).
      <br>
      [This is very interesting information since it shows that the
      number of
      people killed could be much higher than was originally thought.]</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How
      can you develop your essay plan while you are researching?</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">All
      the decisions about what will go into your essay and in what order
      are
      made at the research stage, not at the essay writing stage. This
      is a
      common mistake made by students who do not establish enough of a
      connection between the two stages.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">At the
      beginning of your research, you started out with your rough essay
      plan
      as a basis for the headings in your research document. As you go
      along,
      you may add more headings or sub-headings to your research
      document.
      For example, you might find that there are three sub-topics under
      the
      first main topic that you wish to discuss, and so you will create
      sub-headings for them. The information under these sub-headings
      will
      eventually become paragraphs in your essay.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As you
      conduct your research, you must critically analyse the information
      that
      you find. Change your sections around in order of importance.
      Decide
      what information should be included and what should not. All these
      decisions should be made at the research stage, so that by the
      time you
      come to do your writing you know exactly what you will be writing
      about
      and in what order, down to each paragraph. You will have in front
      of
      you exactly what information needs to be used in each section and
      paragraph of your essay. This also means that you will never feel
      like
      you are starting from scratch or have nothing to go on when you
      begin
      writing your first draft.</p>
