        School is out for the day. The kids are home. They have had
        their after school snack. Now they want to play. When should
        they get their homework done? This answer depends on your kids
        and your schedule at home. Find the time that works best for
        your family. <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes it works best to get the homework done and out of the
        way. Right after school, you can sit down with your kids and
        talk about their day. It's a great time to pull out the homework
        and get to it. After dinner you can clean up the kitchen table
        and plop down the textbooks. The kids have had time to play and
        relax after school. This might be the perfect time to engage
        their minds. <br>
        <br>
        If your kids are early risers, getting homework done in the
        morning before school might work well for your family. They can
        eat breakfast and get ready for school. Instead of morning
        cartoons, this might be a great alternative. If you have extra
        time, sit down with your kids and help them finish up their
        homework. This will be a great prep to get them ready for a day
        of learning at school. <br>
        <br>
        You don't want to do the last minute homework dash. This can
        happen when your children don't have a regular homework time. It
        can be easy to forget about homework after school. Next morning,
        as your children gather their things for school, they suddenly
        remember. This adds stress to your morning and gives unnecessary
        stress to your kids. Make sure that you find a time to do
        homework that works for your family. Consistently doing homework
        or after school reading helps develop successful study habits
        that will carry with them.<br>

        Homework time can be as bad as getting your child to clean their
        room.
        They've been at school all day, and they don't want to sit down
        and do
        any more work. How can you help your child avoid the
        hassle? <br>
        First, establish a specific time each day that is set aside for
        homework. Having a routine helps kids know what to expect, and
        they
        adjust better. Check your family schedule to find a time that
        can work
        consistently.<br>
        Next, have all items needed for homework in the same area for
        easy
        access. If your child uses a computer to type reports, make it
        available in any easy location. Keep a supply of pencils,
        crayons,
        paper, and markers&nbsp; as well as a pencil sharpener, nearby
        so that your
        child isn't spending homework time looking for supplies. <br>
        <br>
        If you kids don't have any homework, have them use the time
        getting
        some extra reading done. Also, help your kids keep track of
        deadlines
        for homework projects by writing them out on a calendar or
        another
        method of tracking. <br>
        Younger children will need help with their homework. It can be
        very
        frustrating if they don't understand something and there is no
        one to
        help them. Make sure that you or someone else is available when
        they
        are doing their homework so they can get the answers they need
        when
        they need them.<br>
        <br>
        Make sure your children don't wait until the last minute to
        complete
        their assignments. It's a lot of stress for them and you. I'm
        sure many
        parents have spent Sunday night helping their child finish up an
        assignment they forgot about. And speaking of forgetting, make
        sure
        they get in the habit of putting their homework away for school
        tomorrow. No parent likes the phone call asking them to bring
        something
        to school that their child forgot.</big></p>
