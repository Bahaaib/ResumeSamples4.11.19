        Fact number 1: A large percentage of scholarship applicants
        today fail in writing one of the most important stage in
        application: writing a good scholarship essay.<br>
        <br>
        Fact number 2: You could be one of them.<br>
        <br>
        But from these 2 facts, we can still arrive to a third one:
        there is still hope.<br>
        <br>
        Yes, you can still write a scholarship essay that creates
        result.<br>
        <br>
        Whether you are a writing guru or a high school slob, you can
        always write a good scholarship essay if you follow one basic
        writing secret (which of course is not a secret at all, it is
        just that few people follow this): simplicity.<br>
        <br>
        Here are the tips in writing simple yet effective scholarship
        essay:<br>
        <br>
        · Write as you speak.<br>
        <br>
        “Thesaurusizing” your scholarship essay would have two effects:
        one, wrong use of terms will detract the purpose of the essay,
        and two, you probably will not pass. The thing is: keep it
        simple, clear and precise. Use words that are easy to understand
        like the words you use when you converse.<br>
        <br>
        · Write interestingly.<br>
        <br>
        Make sure you don’t bore your readers. Keeping up a lively essay
        would let your reader to finish your essay but make sure you
        still focus on the purpose.<br>
        <br>
        · Tell about yourself<br>
        <br>
        Since you are writing to ask a sort of “favor”, your reader
        would like to know more about yourself. Usually, most
        scholarship application would require you to pass an essay
        together with your resume. Write things about yourself that are
        not included on the resume.<br>
        <br>
        · Keep it short<br>
        <br>
        Write a short scholarship essay but it does not mean you omit
        important sentences that needs be addressed. Never be wordy on
        your essay. If you can pack your thoughts in the shortest
        possible terms, do so. It is better to read a 5-liner paragraph
        than a 10-liner that says the same thing.<br>
        <br>
        · Do variations<br>
        <br>
        If your first sentence starts with an “I”, the second sentence
        should be different. Be creative in writing your essay.<br>
        <br>
        · Use active voice<br>
        <br>
        Using active voice (sentences without the use of the word “be”)
        keeps reading continuous and interesting. Using passive voice on
        the other hand keeps the essay uninteresting and flat.<br>
        <br>
        · Seek for opinion<br>
        <br>
        If you have finished writing your essay, let others read it so
        that you get feedbacks. In this way, you can improve your
        articles more.<br>
        <br>
        · Edit, re-edit and edit some more<br>
        <br>
        Make improvements. Read your essay over and over again until you
        are confident that it is error-free.<br>
