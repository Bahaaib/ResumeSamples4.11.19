        It is funny how what one person would consider to be little more
        than a minor inconvenience can become a major problem and even a
        significant worry for so many others. This seemingly 'small
        thing' can soon take on a life of its very own as something
        quite major until it is playing on a person's mind and haunting
        their very existence until they have little or no real
        conception of how to proceed without guidance. Fortunately,
        however, help is at hand in the form of this article because
        whilst the problem of an essay word count may be something of a
        minor concern for many students it is something that should not
        be taken for granted as it is only not a problem if you know how
        to handle it effectively when it comes to the essay writing
        process.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, this article will look to provide you with a brief
        overview of some of the things that you should look to deal with
        when considering the problems you may have with your word count.
        With this in mind, one of the first things that I would do is
        consider what actually 'counts' towards your essay word count by
        looking in the guidance that you have received from your
        institution and your individual assessor to check what they
        expect of you.<br>
        <br>
        Now many of you may think 'Well, I don't to do that because
        every word I write should count towards my essay word count so I
        need to structure my essay accordingly' - WRONG!!<br>
        <br>
        More often than not only the words you write in the main body of
        your work will count towards your essay word count. As a result,
        this means that your footnotes, title (i.e. main
        heading/question), subtitles/subheadings, and bibliography will
        NOT count towards your essay word count because they are not
        part of the main body of your work and, with regards to the
        footnotes and bibliography, are meant to give your work greater
        credibility and legitimacy by showing that you are able to
        utilise other people's views in your work and critique them.<br>
        <br>
        Sounds simple doesn't it? <br>
        <br>
        If it only it was that easy . . . <br>
        <br>
        The unfortunate reality is that very often you will be told your
        footnotes WILL count towards your essay word count and so you
        will have to make allowances for them and look to abbreviate
        where necessary/possible to save words for the main body of your
        work according to an academically acceptable system and this can
        be made all the more complex where your computer does not know
        the difference between the main body of the essay and the
        references so make sure to BE AWARE!<br>
        <br>
        What about when you are asked to use a form of 'in-text'
        referencing like Harvard Referencing?<br>
        <br>
        Again, you must check to see whether these reference will be
        included in your essay word count because it is all too easy to
        assume that they will be just because they are included in the
        same area of your work as your discussion and analysis.
        Therefore, where they are not included it is usually a good idea
        to keep a tally of the words that you use for your Harvard
        References so that you can subtract them from your total at the
        end and get the right word count.<br>
        <br>
        Why is it so important to get the right essay word count?<br>
        <br>
        Getting the right essay word count is essential because whilst
        many of you may have heard the 'mythical' view that most
        institutions only check the word count for one out of every
        dozen essay papers that they receive, what with technology's
        ongoing advancement, can you really afford to take the chance.
        This is because the unfortunate reality is that very often if
        you are even ONE SINGLE WORD over you could lose anything up to
        20% of your overall mark that could be the difference between an
        'A' and a 'C' grade or even a 'PASS' or a 'FAIL'.<br>
        <br>
        Of course you may be at one of those institutions where there is
        a 5% excess, but DO NOT take this for granted - make sure that
        you know what 5% of your word count is from the moment you
        starting writing (simply divide your word count by 20 on a
        calculator) and DO NOT go over it!<br>
        <br>
        But how do I manage essay word count when it comes to actually
        writing the work in practice?<br>
        <br>
        You should see some of the many panicked faces that I have seen
        when you tell a student that, after having written a number of
        2,000 words (or less essays), they will now have to write 4,000
        words and - dare I say it - even a 10,000 word dissertation!<br>
        <br>
        The reason why most people start to worry is that they get
        fixated on the number for obvious reasons because '10,000' is a
        lot bigger than '2,000' - I know that this may be a bit 'Noddy'
        for some of you but bear with me as I am getting to my point.<br>
        <br>
        However, what these same people fail to appreciate is that there
        is actually very little difference between the strategies that
        you should be adopting for writing 2,000 words when you are then
        asked to write 10,000 words. This is because whilst many of you
        may just be able to rattle off 2,000 words you may actually be
        costing yourselves marks if you do not take a moment to think
        (of course ignore what I am saying if you are already getting
        top grades for everything you write because you obviously know
        something that I do not and I would love to know your secret!).
        Therefore, when it comes to producing any piece of work
        according to an essay word count I would advise you to have the
        following word in mind - 'PLANNING'.<br>
        <br>
        Well, when thinking about the planning of any of your work I
        would look to consider your essay strutures as being an
        essential aspect of this aspect of your essay writing and so I
        would advise you to first ask yourself the following five
        questions - <br>
        <br>
        (a) What am I being asked to do?<br>
        (b) What does this mean to me?<br>
        (c) How will this effect my writing style?<br>
        (d) What do I already know about what I have been asked to write
        about?<br>
        (e) Where can I find more information?<br>
        <br>
        Then, depending on the nature of the subject that you have been
        asked to write about you may be required to undertake a great
        deal of research or the information may already be available to
        you (i.e. if you are writing about law then you are clearly
        going to need to refer to court decisions and legislation as
        well as other people's views allied to your own, but if you are
        writing about a play then you may still refer to other people's
        views but your own view is likely to become all the more
        significant for the reader so think about what the
        reader/assessor requires from you).<br>
        <br>
        But how does this effect the essay word count?<br>
        <br>
        The answer is it should get you thinking about the structure of
        your work which you can then detail in the first paragraph by
        way of an abstract (particularly for a dissertation or thesis)
        or you may refer to it in the way that I do for an essay as the
        'Introduction to the Introduction' (see my book via my website
        at the bottom of this article for more information) because you
        are using this to tell the reader about your approach to the
        subject matter and in what order this will be undertaken. Then
        the next paragraph will be your 'actual' introduction that
        serves to present the main issue that is to be discussed and its
        importance to the particular aspect of the subject area you are
        studying.<br>
        <br>
        From there the rest of your work should be looking to consider
        matters related to this issue so that, for example, if you are
        asked to consider the 'Effectiveness of the Youth Justice System
        in the UK' you may begin by saying why this issue is so
        important before then looking at what successes their have been
        and the efforts made to deal with any problems. This can be
        effectively achieved by looking at the effectiveness of
        practices including the use of anti-social behaviour orders
        (ASBOS), cautions and exclusion order. Then, finally, you should
        be looking at concluding with a summary of the key points
        derived from your discussion relating to the overall subject
        matter that you have been analysing so as to draw the work to a
        close.<br>
        <br>
        In terms of the word count itself I have found that it is
        generally a good idea to not write less than seven lines and/or
        three sentences and NOT much more than 250 words per paragraph
        so that you keep your arguments and analysis as part of your
        discussion clear and concise without proving too detriment to
        your essay word count. <br>
        <br>
        With this in mind, I generally also like to look to work to the
        following four basic rules with regards to the content of each
        paragraph -<br>
        <br>
        (a) First, make a point that you consider to be important.<br>
        (b) Second, explain why that point is important.<br>
        (c) Third, offer any supporting evidence from other people's
        work and show why it supports what you are saying.<br>
        (d) Fourth, consider whether there is anything that conflicts
        with what you are saying and then use that to move into your
        next paragraph so that the flow of your work is enhanced.<br>
        <br>
        Of course these rules may need to be adapted depending on the
        nature of the work that you have been set, but in principle
        these are just some of the thoughts that go through my head when
        thinking about the essay I am writing and the essay word count
        that is available for that work.<br>
