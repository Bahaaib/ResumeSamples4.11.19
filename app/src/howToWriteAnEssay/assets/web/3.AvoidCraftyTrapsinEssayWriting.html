        forget about poor grades for your writing assignments once and
        all the time.<br>
        <br>
        <b># Say No to poor thesis statement</b><br>
        <br>
        Everything you write should develop around a clear central
        thesis statement. Good thesis statement zeroes in one main idea
        and states it clearly, avoiding ambiguous and vague phrases.<br>
        <br>
        It should be specific, analytic and has to evaluate the
        significant insights of your essay. Strong thesis statement
        usually introduces the original approach to the traditional view
        on the problem.<br>
        <br>
        <b># Avoid weak introduction and open-ended conclusion</b><br>
        <br>
        Focus on one primary function of the introduction - to introduce
        your thesis statement clearly and precisely so that to grab the
        attention of the audience. The success strategy of writing your
        introduction is to start with the broad statement of your main
        idea and to close it with the actual thesis of your essay.<br>
        <br>
        Don’t leave the unfinished and open-ended feeling at the end of
        your essay. Always remember that your paper must make its point
        clear right from the beginning and up to the logical ending.<br>
        <br>
        Make your conclusion coherent and smooth and be sure to stress
        the significance of your work in the concluding part of your
        essay, pointing the ways in which your invaluable contributions
        can be applied.<br>
        <br>
        <b># Beware of undeveloped essay</b><br>
        <br>
        This problem is particularly common and results from not
        understanding clearly the essence of the chosen topic. Selecting
        your essay topic make sure to familiar with it completely and to
        ask yourself what you really feel passionate about and don’t
        forget to research it preliminary very thoroughly.<br>
        <br>
        Your paper won’t produce an undeveloped impression if you
        provide your work with a solid argumentative ground, explaining
        clearly your view on the researched topic and elucidate the past
        attempts of the solution of this problem. So that to show the
        professor that you’ve got the core of the chosen topic at your
        finger tips.<br>
        <br>
        <b># Never use slang language</b><br>
        <br>
        Bear in mind that slang language and curse words are absolutely
        inappropriate in your work. Always remember that your targeted
        audience is educated professors. More over that college writing
        commonly implies the utilization of the formal style, which has
        definite frameworks.<br>
        <br>
        <b># Don’t just recollect the events in your paper</b><br>
        <br>
        Simple recollecting of the events is boring and unrecognizable
        to the reader and can become an absolute failure to the writer.
        “A good essay is one with imaginary appealing to the five
        senses.” Try to harness this strategy in your essay writing.
        Make your audience feel, taste, smell and hear everything you
        are narrating about.<br>
        Hope that these useful hints will help you gain the upper hand
        over your restless essay writing enemies, strengthen your
        writing skills and ultimately help you get excellent grades for
        your writing assignments.<br>
