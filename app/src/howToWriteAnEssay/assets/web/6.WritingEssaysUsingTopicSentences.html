      When you outline your essay's topic sentences in the special way
      I'll teach you, the idea level of your essay will not only be
      clearly organized, but it will also entice readers into reading
      the body paragraphs of your essay, as well.<br>
      <br>
      Here's the deal---The key ingredients for topic sentences are
      keywords, and there are two kinds:<br>
      <br>
      1. CORE KEYWORDS, which are the main ideas in your thesis<br>
      <br>
      2. Newness Keywords, which link your stories, examples, and
      reasoning support to your CORE KEYWORDS<br>
      <br>
      Identify CORE KEYWORDS<br>
      <br>
      For instance, suppose you're writing an essay about salads.<br>
      <br>
      You start off saying how most people love salads, and so do you.
      And, like most people, you like all kinds of salads, even fruit
      salads. But you're different in that you can't stand fruit salads
      with apples, bananas, or pears in them.<br>
      <br>
      So here's your thesis (CORE KEYWORDS are CAPITALIZED):<br>
      <br>
      Like most people, I love salads, even FRUIT SALADS, but I just
      CAN'T STAND FRUIT SALADS with APPLES or BANANAS or PEARS.<br>
      <br>
      Here's a topic sentence for the first body paragraph to go with
      that thesis:<br>
      <br>
      I just CAN'T STAND APPLES in FRUIT SALADS.<br>
      <br>
      Though the topic sentence does link back to the thesis with CORE
      KEYWORDS, that's a pretty dull topic sentence, isn't it? Can you
      see why? Think about it for a moment. Something is dull and boring
      whennnnnnnn---can you think of when?<br>
      <br>
      Okay, here it is---something is dull, boring, and uninteresting
      when there is nothing new in it (you knew that, right?). There's
      nothing new in that topic sentence---it has already been stated in
      the thesis. It has no Newness Keywords to make readers curious
      about what's next.<br>
      <br>
      Create General Newness Keywords<br>
      <br>
      To provide interest to CORE KEYWORDS and the main idea in your
      thesis, you add Newness Keywords.<br>
      <br>
      Newness Keywords are generalities---that is, they are just a bit
      more general than the specifics of the stories, examples, or
      reasoning they introduce in their paragraph---and they usually
      summarize the paragraph. The following two sentences are preferred
      alternates to that deadly dull topic sentence above, and they
      illustrate some general Newness Keywords (italicized):<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      I just can't stand apples in fruit salads---not red ones, anyway.<br>
      <br>
      I just can't stand apples in fruit salads because of some very bad
      experiences I had with apples in different foods.<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      You can see that by adding some general information as Newness
      Keywords you are telling your reader what kind of details are
      coming up in the paragraph. The first example indicates that the
      paragraph will tell something about "not red ones;" it may seem
      specific, but it's not too specific, since we don't know which
      "red ones" are being referred to or why.<br>
      <br>
      The second example suggests you will reveal those "bad
      experiences" that have made you dislike apples in fruit salads.
      But, again, we don't know which specific "bad experiences," so
      it's a generality. Those Newness Keywords make those topic
      sentences more interesting because they entice readers into
      wanting to read on and find out the specifics, the interesting
      details.<br>
      <br>
      Newness Keywords are the secret sauce that appeal to your reader's
      curiosity.<br>
      <br>
      Combine CORE and Newness Keywords in Topic Sentences<br>
      <br>
      When you combine Newness Keywords with CORE KEYWORDS in a topic
      sentence, you connect with the main idea of the thesis, and you
      hint at interesting details to come in the following paragraph, as
      you'll see in the following three examples.<br>
      <br>
      Example #1. Here's a thesis supported with an outline of topic
      sentences. The outline shows the use of specific CORE KEYWORDS
      (CAPITALIZED) and general Newness Keywords(italicized):<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      Thesis<br>
      <br>
      After my parents' DIVORCE, I actually GREW CLOSER to MY ABSENT
      FATHER in EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL, and FINANCIAL WAYS.<br>
      <br>
      Outline of Topic Sentences That Entice Readers <br>
      <br>
      Despite the DIVORCE, I've GROWN EMOTIONALLY CLOSER to MY FATHER
      because now he lets me talk to him about important things, like
      boys.<br>
      <br>
      Although he's NOT AROUND EVERY DAY, MY FATHER does SOCIAL things
      with me nowadays, like going on "dates."<br>
      <br>
      Best of all, MY DAD'S FINANCIAL WAYS are better, now, and he buys
      me lots of fun things and gives me more money than before the
      divorce.<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      You've heard that, "A picture is worth a thousand words"---well, a
      good example is, too, and I think the example above says a lot.So
      I'll just show you those topic sentences without their Newness
      Keywords and let you compare and see how much those Newness
      Keywords helped add enticing interest:<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      Despite the divorce, I've grown emotionally closer to my father.<br>

      me lots of fun things and gives me more money than before the
      divorce.<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      Quite interesting differences, aren't they?<br>
      <br>
      Without Newness Keywords, readers won't have much interest in
      reading on. But with the general Newness Keywords added, readers
      are stimulated to find out---<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      what "important things" she talks about with her dad, especially
      since there's a hint that one of those things is "boys"---whether
      you're a guy or a gal, you're probably thinking: Hmm... could be
      something juicy, even though this is an essay... you never know...
      I'll check this out....<br>
      what sort of "dates" will she tell about---might be some fancy
      restaurants you've heard about, or some concerts that only a dad
      would probably be able to afford, or maybe off to see the Grand
      Canyon or Disneyland or the Cayman Islands, lots of
      possibilities... might be worth reading on to find out....<br>
      what "fun things" is her dad buying her now? And he's giving her
      more money than he did before the divorce? I don't know about you,
      but I'm interested to hear the specific details, especially if
      those really are "fun things" and just how much more money he's
      giving her now....<br>
      <br>
      See what I'm getting at?<br>
      <br>
      Example #2. This student example with CORE KEYWORDS and Newness
      Keywords gives another good illustration of how to entice readers
      to read on for the interesting details:<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      Thesis<br>
      <br>
      I would never have guessed that RIDING A NOISY, DIRTY CITY BUS
      would TEACH ME to RELAX, GET BETTER GRADES, and APPRECIATE THE
      HUMOR IN PEOPLE.<br>
      <br>
      Outline of Topic Sentences That Entice Readers<br>
      <br>
      That NOISY, DIRTY CITY BUS taught me to RELAX because I finally
      realized that no amount of cursing could hurry it.<br>
      <br>
      After learning to RELAX on the BUS, I began studying French
      regularly while riding, which introduced me to my French angel and
      GOT ME much BETTER GRADES in French.<br>
      <br>
      RIDING THE CITY BUS TAUGHT ME TO APPRECIATE THE HUMOR IN PEOPLE by
      showing me lots of silly personal dramas.<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      Of course, learning to relax on a bus is a yawner, but the first
      topic sentence suggests there's an interesting story about cursing
      that goes along with that, which could provide some interesting
      phrases... might be a little shocking and fun to read about....<br>
      <br>
      In the second topic sentence, the familiar, old view of getting
      nothing but irritation out of riding a bus might have some
      expected silver linings, but better grades because of it...?! And
      what's that angel thing about?! Hmmm... just might have some tips
      that could be interesting and maybe even useful....<br>
      <br>
      The Newness Keywords in the third topic sentence also look
      enticing, with the hint about "lots of silly personal dramas."
      Sounds like some fun stories are going to be told in the next
      paragraph or two....<br>
      <br>
      Example #2 shows once again the usefulness of Newness Keywords and
      the clarity and interest they can bring to your topic sentences
      while, at the same time, keeping focus on the main ideas of the
      thesis.<br>
      <br>
      Example #3. Here's another example of using topic sentences to
      outline the support for your thesis and get the reader's curiosity
      juices flowing:<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      Thesis<br>
      <br>
      Because of MY TYPING TEACHER'S NASTY CRITICISM in my sophomore
      year, I found UNEXPECTED MOTIVATION TO BECOME A SECRETARY, as
      shown by MY PRACTICE, MY SECRETARIAL BUSINESS SCHOOLING, and MY
      FIRST JOB.<br>
      <br>
      Outline of Topic Sentences That Entice Readers <br>
      <br>
      Because of HER, over two years I PRACTICED so much that I
      developed wrists almost as strong as my athletic brother's.<br>
      <br>
      Since MY NASTY TYPING TEACHER graduated from a local business
      school, I got my own schooling there just to show her up---and I
      did!<br>
      <br>
      Finally, I got MY FIRST SECRETARIAL JOB, making about twice what
      she makes---and I cleverly let her find out about it.<br>
      <br>
      ************<br>
      <br>
      In the first topic sentence just above, "Because of HER"
      summarizes "Because of my typing teacher's nasty criticism" from
      the thesis. One reason this works is that the first topic sentence
      follows right after the thesis in the essay, as usual, so we can
      easily see the connection. This might not have worked with any of
      the other topic sentences because they would be too far away from
      the thesis.<br>
      <br>
      The Newness Keywords in the first topic sentence causes us to look
      forward to learning how strong her wrists really became.... could
      she beat her brother up, now?... seems to be leaning in that
      direction a bit...wonder whether that's the case... think I'll
      find out....<br>
      <br>
      The Newness Keywords in the second topic sentence also rouse our
      curiosity ... just how much did she manage to show up that nasty
      typing teacher... 'rooting for the little guy'.... <br>
      <br>
      The third topic sentence uses Newness Keywords to let us know
      there's a final blow to the writer's long-worked-out plan of
      revenge... can't wait to read about how she cleverly let her know
      about it, how she reacted, bet it's great....<br>
      <br>
      As you can see from these three example outlines of topic
      sentences I've shared with you, any writer of essays can write
      Newness Keywords in such a way that they'll make their readers
      curious and want to read on.<br>
      <br>
      Wouldn't that be a pleasant change in the state of student essay
      writing---especially yours?<br>
