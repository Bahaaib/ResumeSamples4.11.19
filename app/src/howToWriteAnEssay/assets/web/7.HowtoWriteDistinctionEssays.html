        Every Time - The Six Steps to Academic Essay Writing</span><br>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There
      are six steps to writing an academic essay. If you follow each of
      these
      steps correctly, you will find that you can write university
      essays
      that will earn you a distinction (or high distinction) every time.
      It
      is simply a matter of understanding what steps to follow, and then
      completing each of them thoroughly.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This
      article provides an outline and brief description of each of these
      steps. It is an introduction to a series of articles that will
      examine
      each step in more depth. Reading just this article alone will
      provide
      you with assistance in learning how to plan, research and write
      your
      essays. However, reading all the articles in the series will allow
      you
      to gain a more sophisticated insight into essay writing, and to
      improve
      your grades even further.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These
      are the six steps you need to follow to write high quality
      university
      essays:</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>1.
        Analyse the Question</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">There
      are generally two types of essays: argumentative essays and
      explanatory
      essays. In an argumentative essay, you are expected to put forward
      an
      academic argument in answer to the essay question and support your
      argument with academic sources (references). In an explanatory
      essay,
      you are expected to explain or describe a process or topic in
      answer to
      an essay question and support your argument with academic sources
      (references). Regardless of the type of essay you are writing, it
      is
      very important that you understand what is being asked of you
      before
      you begin your research and writing your essay.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
      must be sure that you understand all parts of the question and
      what it
      is asking you to do. You must be able to recognise the 'task
      words' in
      the question, which tell you what you have to do (for example,
      'discuss', 'compare', 'analyse' or 'argue') and the 'key words' in
      the
      question, which tell you what you are being asked to write about
      (for
      example, Critical Thinking, or the roles of registered nurses).
      (More
      information on this step will be provided in the article 'How to
      Write
      Distinction Essays Every Time: Step 1. Analyse the Question.')</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>2.
        Draft the Essay Plan</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
      must write the first draft of your essay plan before you start
      your
      research. This will give your research direction and ultimately
      make it
      easier for you to write your essay. Having a plan will let you
      know
      what you need to research and how much research you need on each
      topic
      or subject that you will be writing about.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
      will base this first draft of your essay plan on your essay
      question,
      and your current knowledge of your subject. It will not happen
      very
      often that you are asked to write an essay on a topic you know
      nothing
      about, since you will already be studying the subject and will
      normally
      have had one or more lectures or tutorials on the topic.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is
      acceptable if your essay plan is rough or vague at this point, or
      if
      you do not have a great deal of detail. You will develop your
      essay
      plan (expanding it and including more detail) and possibly even
      change
      it as you go through the research process.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>3.
        Conduct the Research</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Part
      One: Organising your Research using a Research Document</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your
      research should be organised so that the transition from doing
      your
      research to writing your essay is simple. The best way to do this
      is to
      organise your research so that it matches the organisation of the
      essay. In Step 2 of writing an academic essay, you would have
      written a
      rough essay plan before you began your research. This essay plan
      is the
      guide you need to use to organise your research.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Copy
      and paste this essay plan into a Word document. All your research
      for
      this essay will be recorded in this one document. Use each of the
      dot
      points from your essay plan (topics you are planning to discuss)
      as a
      heading in your research document. When you do your research, you
      will
      organise it in the order that the information will appear in your
      essay. Doing this means you will be organising your research by
      theme
      or topic, not by source.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Part
      Two: Research Skills and Academic Sources</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Being
      able to tell the difference between an academic source and a
      non-academic source, knowing where to find academic sources and
      deciding what sources are relevant to your research are important
      skills that you will develop during your tertiary studies.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The
      first place you should go is the library, even if this means
      ordering
      in books from other libraries. For academics to have their books
      (and
      journal articles) published, they must go through a process called
      peer-reviewing. During this process, one or more other academics
      who
      are experts in the field will read and assess a book or article to
      decide if it is of publishable standard. This is why your research
      will
      be of the highest quality if you use books, monographs, textbooks
      and
      journal articles written by academics for your research, because
      the
      work had to meet academic standards. There is no such process for
      publishing on the internet; anyone can write whatever they like on
      any
      subject.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your
      second stop after books, monographs and textbooks will be journal
      articles. Some of these will only be available in hardcopy from
      the
      library, but many will be available in their full-text versions
      through
      online electronic databases, such as JStore, ProQuest and Ingenta.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>4.
        Finalise the Essay Plan</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In
      Step 2, you would have drafted a rough essay plan before you began
      your
      research. During the research process (in Step 3), you would have
      developed this plan further as you learned more information on
      your
      topic. Once you have completed your research, and before you begin
      writing your first draft, you need to re-think your essay plan and
      write a final version based on what you discovered during your
      research. Your final essay plan will contain more detail than your
      first draft and be a very specific guide to how to write your
      essay.
      Once you have completed the final draft of your essay plan, you
      are
      ready to begin writing the first draft of your essay.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>5.
        Write the First Draft of the Essay</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now
      that you have completed your research in an organised way and have
      written a final draft of your essay plan, writing the first draft
      of
      your essay will be easier than it ever has been. All of the
      following
      decisions about your essay have already been made:</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">* What
      your answer to the essay question is
      <br>
      * What main points you will discuss in order to back up your
      argument
      <br>
      * The order in which to discuss your main points
      <br>
      * How long to spend discussing each main point
      <br>
      * What information each paragraph will contain (i.e. what
      information
      you will use to discuss each of your main points)
      <br>
      * What references you will use to back up your argument</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Thus,
      there is no reason for you to feel lost or stare at your computer
      screen not knowing what to write. If you do get stuck for any
      reason,
      the best thing to do is to just keep writing. You can always
      improve
      something once you have written something down. If you have not
      written
      anything, not much can be done until you do.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b>6.
        Professional Academic Editing</b></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Once
      you have completed writing your essay, it is vital that you have
      it
      professionally edited by an academic editor. You have just spent a
      significant amount of time doing the best possible job on your
      essay or
      assignment, doing your research and writing up your results. After
      all
      this effort, it is critical that your work is presented in the
      best
      possible way. Using a professional academic editor will ensure
      that
      your work is polished, well written, and presented correctly.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If
      English is your second language, having your essay or assignment
      professionally edited is even more important. You do not want
      mistakes
      in your writing to confuse your markers or distract them from the
      important arguments you are making. This could lead to you
      receiving a
      grade lower than the grade you really deserve.</p>
