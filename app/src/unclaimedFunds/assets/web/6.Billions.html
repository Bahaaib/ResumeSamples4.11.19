          Are you aware that millions and billions of dollars of
          “Unclaimed Money” is being held at this very second by the
          United States and Canadian Government agencies and that this
          figure continues to grow at amazing and incredible to believe
          $ 250 million dollars each and every year.<br>
          <br>
          It may be like winning the lottery for you. Could you not use
          an extra $ 50,000, $ 100,000 or more? Would you like to take a
          dream vacation, buy a new car with cash, provide your children
          with a college education, or buy the new home that you always
          wanted?<br>
          <br>
          A big chunk of this money could easily be yours by simply
          sending an email , sending a single letter , making a phone
          call, or spending a few hours browsing on your computer or
          researching for a few hours at your local library.<br>
          <br>
          Little known secrets cam provide you with all the information
          needed to make these dreams come true, Best yet obtaining this
          money is perfectly legal and legitimate.<br>
          <br>
          You may well the lost heir and rightful owner to millions of
          dollars. Billions of dollars of assets are now being held by
          the state governments for individuals who have not been
          located, range from unclaimed tax refunds, stocks, dividends,
          or descendant’s estates, to renter’s security deposits,
          utility company deposits and the contents of safety security
          boxes. All of these amounts to billions and you could well hit
          the jackpot with a simple search for yourself, or someone
          else.<br>
          <br>
          Any state’s unclaimed property division should be able to
          provide you with a complete and current listing of unclaimed
          property accounts, names and last known addresses. If for you
          some reason, they cannot, ask for the name and date of the
          last publication or website postings that the information was
          released in. You may find that listing by searching on the web
          (search engines such as Google or yahoo may form the start of
          your search). You may well have to search local newspapers
          which are held in stacks or on microfiche at your local
          library.<br>
          <br>
          It may even be that you can make a livelihood out of your
          enterprise. You can charge a “finder fee” for services
          rendered. Once you have your listing narrow your search down
          to those unclaimed assets with the highest values. Remember a
          good percentage of a large piece of pie (or in this case
          money), may well be worth a fair chunk more than a solitary
          meager piece of pie.<br>
          <br>
          If a person named in you newly acquired unclaimed property
          listing is at the same address as indicated you may well have
          made the easiest money of your life in finder’s fees. If not
          begin your searching online phone directories, or even
          physical directories at the library. <br>
          <br>
          You can always purchase almost anything on the internet. For a
          relatively small fee you can buy online services, cads or
          programs with more exhaustive lists of phone numbers and
          addresses as well as additional data of greater scope. Many
          people have unlisted phone numbers or simply cell phones that
          do not show up on online directories. Again the extra services
          that you may well have purchased may well come in handy in
          locating these lost heirs.<br>
          <br>
          Thus it is a two step process of research. First find the
          money. Next find the rightful owner. Third collect your money
          and well earned large finder’s fees.<br>
