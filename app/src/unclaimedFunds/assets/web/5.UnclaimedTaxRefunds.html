              Some Money?</b></font></big></big><br>

          You work hard for your money and every paycheck you watch as
          the government funnels away some of it. Because I pay
          attention to just how much I lose every pay period, I was
          shocked to find out that there are over a billion dollars of
          unclaimed tax refunds sitting in a US Treasury account. <br>
          <br>
          The account I read, from 2008, stated that the total amount of
          unclaimed tax refunds was $1.2b. That's a very large chunk of
          change that we are entitled to, and have chosen not to
          collect. Basically, this amounts to the same thing as taking
          $500 (the median amount owed to taxpayers) and throwing it
          away. If you wouldn't do that then why are you not demanding
          the money that you have already earned? <br>
          <br>
          If you haven't filed your taxes in the last few years, don't
          worry. There is no penalty for filing late unless you owe
          money. But we'll work on the assumption that you didn't file
          because you knew you were entitled to a return, but got busy.
          The deadline to file taxes is April 15th, and you can file
          returns for the previous four tax years. This means that if
          you haven't filed for income tax since 2002, you can receive
          any unclaimed tax rebates as far back as 2005. It is really
          not that difficult, as I stated there are numerous software
          programs to assist, and even if you are doing a traditional
          paper return as long as you follow instructions and use a
          calculator you should be fine.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          To complete your return(s) you can go to the Internal Revenue
          Service website at http://www.irs.gov and download the
          appropriate tax package. I found that the quickest way to
          navigate to the downloads was to type "tax packages" into the
          built-in search bar. While on the site, you can also request
          any missing forms that you require. Complete the return and
          submit it, within a month you will get a check. It's almost
          like found money. <br>
          <br>
          So far we have discussed how your tax refund can go unclaimed
          due to your not requesting it, but the majority of unclaimed
          funds are actually a result of the government being unable to
          contact you. If you are missing a refund and moved, that is
          likely the culprit. During the hurly-burly of moving, we have
          so much occupying us that letting the government know our new
          address is usually not a large priority. But a simple change
          of address form with the post office or a call to the IRS
          directly can ensure that you do not lose out on your money. <br>
          <br>
          These "missed" payments happen so frequently that the
          government has had to create a specific website just to handle
          requests for refunds. Where is My Rebate allows taxpayers to
          track their refund status and correct any information such as
          direct deposit, address, etc. To access the service you will
          need to have your social security number, the amount of your
          refund that you calculated and your marital status for the tax
          year in question. <br>
          <br>
          I hope that this has shown you how easy it will be to see if
          you are entitled to, and how to get any unclaimed tax refunds
          that you are owed. You don't really trust the government with
          your money, do you?<br>
