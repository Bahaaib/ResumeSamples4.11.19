          Unclaimed Money and unclaimed property searches are conducted
          by most Americans on an annual, if not biannual, basis. With
          over $25 billion in unclaimed money in the United States, most
          people find money for themselves or one of their immediate
          family members. Unfortunately, if the search is not done
          thoroughly you may miss money owed to you.<br>
          <br>
          Here are 5 tips to help you search for your unclaimed money:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1 - Search For Variations Of Your Name</b><br>
          <br>
          For example, a person named William J. Smith may have money
          under W. Smith, Bill Smith, W J Smith, etc. Search all
          possible name variations to ensure the unclaimed money account
          was not listed under a variation of your name.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>2 - Look In All State And Federal Databases</b><br>
          <br>
          The missing funds are reported in state and federal databases.
          You may have money in any of the over 54 databases. Even if
          you have only lived in one state you may still have money in
          another states database. If you were owed money from a life
          insurance policy from a company in New York, that company may
          report the money in the New York state database. An
          inheritance may be in the benefactor's state database. If you
          search only your state of residency you may miss money owed to
          you.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3 - Know All Past Addresses Of The Person Whose Name You
            Are Searching</b><br>
          <br>
          When you do a missing money search you will be given the
          results that match the searched name. The results may not all
          be an accurate match. You will have to search the results
          based on name and past address or account information. It
          could be under any address the person had in their lifetime.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4 - Use A Quality, All-In-One Database</b><br>
          <br>
          To search all state and federal databases would take a
          tremendous amount of time and you would most likely give up
          before you completed all of the searches. It is much more
          efficient to use an all in one database. There are many of
          these databases but make sure you use a quality database. What
          makes a "quality" database? A quality database is one that is
          constantly updated, which will update new missing money
          accounts reported and will remove claimed accounts. It will
          also include ALL state and federal databases.&nbsp; Look
          inside this app for databases to search.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5 - Follow through with the claim process for all found
            money accounts</b><br>
          <br>
          Once you locate money owed to you print the necessary forms
          and make the copies of the ID's or documents needed to process
          the claim. Usually, the required forms are driver's license or
          a death or birth certificate and you may need to fill out a
          claim form or two. This process should only take you about 15
          minutes or so. Then send in the claim forms! If the claims
          forms aren't sent in you'll never get the money that's owed to
          you.<br>
          <br>
          Following these simple tips when searching for your share of
          the nation's unclaimed money will greatly increase your found
          accounts and make sure none are overlooked. Search and find
          how much is owed to you today!<br>
