    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In 1999, the
          Montel Williams show aired a presentation about lost money. At
          first, I thought that the subject of the show was money that
          someone previously had literally lost. The subject could have
          been funds squandered either through gambling or bad
          investments. Though, the show was about funds that many of us
          have and we simply don’t know that we have it.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;Chat show host Oprah Winfrey also had an interesting
          show on the topic of lost money. Oprah proved that people are
          not conscious of the missing funds by uniting seventy-thousand
          dollars in lost money to audience members. These audience
          members were pleasantly surprised to have the funds that were
          rightfully theirs. Further, she went on to explain that
          hundreds of millions of dollars go unclaimed each year.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;A great number of Americans have unclaimed property, or
          lost money, floating around in federal and state accounts. The
          unclaimed money or property alone has reached in excess of
          forty billion dollars in these institutions. Here’s the
          interesting part. Nearly over five-hundred billion dollars are
          held up in both private and public corporations. These
          staggering numbers are due to the simple fact that people are
          not even aware of their lost money.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;A rough estimate of seven out of ten people has
          unclaimed property or funds locked away somewhere without even
          knowing about it. Of all odds, you might be just one of those
          people. The question is whether Montel Williams or Oprah
          Winfrey will have repeat shows on the topic of lost money but
          it doesn’t seem likely. Unfortunately, Oprah Winfrey and
          Montel Williams don’t have quite enough time to find lost
          money for people across the United States. Of course, it may
          be in your best interest to take matters into your own hands
          by doing a little research for your self. Your first step
          would be finding out about your heritage could. Additionally,
          there are also several web sites that offer information on the
          subject of finding lost money as well.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;As always, it is best to be wary of scams when it comes
          to personal finances and personal information. One must always
          avoid divulging too much information to an unsecured party. In
          case someone asks for your date of birth, your social security
          number and your mother’s maiden name, a red flag should go up.
          Furthermore, you never want to provide information about your
          personal bank account and you definitely don’t want to make an
          investment on your search. If the money is yours, you should
          be able to find it without doling out a lot of cash in the
          process.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;Isn't It Time That You Claimed Your Long Lost Money?<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;Where do the billions and billions of unclaimed dollars
          all come from &gt; Each and every year hundreds of thousands
          of individuals across the United States and Canada, leave
          their friends, family relatives and birthplace to follow a
          dream m start another life and to consequently relocate.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;The reasons they leave “home” are as varied as there are
          people who do! But one thing is certain; those who move away
          are looking towards the future. Not to the past. In turn, many
          thousands lose contact either by chance or by choice with the
          passing of time.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;Our forever changing society has resulted in the fact
          that most people do not have the slightest idea who, where
          most of their relatives are! Think about it! Do you personally
          know all of your relatives? That includes aunts, great- aunts,
          uncles and great-uncles, half- brothers and sisters,
          grandparents, great-grandparents, etc. The answer for most
          people is an unequivocal now.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;Grandparents generally have some sketchy ideas about the
          long-range past, but if one asks for information regarding
          missing or l “long lost relatives” it never comes up. And once
          the grandparents are gone chances are that you will never
          know.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;So why is all this important? Because “lost” works both
          ways. Either you have long lost relatives or you are a lost
          relative if someone who would like to get in touch with you.
          It could well mean – “untold” wealth that is just waiting to
          be discovered.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;Imagine for a moment that a great-uncle, who has
          survived and aunt dies and has named you as the sole heir to
          his entire estate of 2 million dollars. However no one,
          including the great- uncle knew where you were. After a
          half-hearted search, the attorneys will take their fees from
          the estate and the balance will go to the states: unclaimed
          money account”. Or if you reside in Canada to the “Bank of
          Canada”.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;It has been estimated that over $ 250,000,000,000 in
          unclaimed money is being held by the U.S.’s individual states
          and upward of $ 500,000,000 by the Banks of Canada.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;In Canada, all financial institutions are required by
          law to submit the names and last known address of accounts
          that have been inactive for at least seven years. After that
          period of time, the financial institution has already sent out
          two notices. One is sent out after two years of inactivity,
          the next after five years. After the limit is reached all
          unclaimed funds are released to the Bank of Canada, but each
          account, as in the case of U.S. accounts remains in the name
          of the original holder.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          &nbsp;In the United States, each state has a different
          standard of time variance, although many may be the same.
          However, all financial institutions including retirement
          funds, insurance companies, banks, county government offices,
          etc, are also required by law to report unclaimed money to the
          state. After some time as specified by law, the money is then
          turned over to the state treasury department unclaimed
          property division. In either case, to get their rightful
          money, all you need to do is locate it, and then ask for it.<br>
