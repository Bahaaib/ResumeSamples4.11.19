<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How
To Format CV Headings And What Should Be Included </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The first and
most prominent item on your CV if your name and contact
information. Your name is typically in the largest font, standing apart
from all other text on your CV. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A common mistake
professionals make is trying to emphasize their name in a special font
type. As it is difficult to anticipate the software and its version
your potential employer is using, you run a risk of not knowing exactly
how your name will show up on their screen. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Stick to the
basic font types &ndash; Arial and Times New Roman are most commonly
used and are least risky when it comes to formatting your CV.
Don&rsquo;t go overboard on the font size either. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Your name should
be in point size 14 or 16; all other headings should be in 12 or 14
point font, while the remaining text of your CV should be between
10 and 12 points. Along with your name, the very top of your CV
should contain your mailing address, your email address, and at least
one phone number where you can be reached. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is best to
include a physical mailing address over a P.O. Box, whenever possible.
You should never include an email address at your current place of
employment (believe us, it happens). A helpful hint about listing your
email address &ndash; make sure that it contains your name, as this
helps you appear more professional. You can create a free Yahoo email
account; it also maybe helpful to have one email address as a point of
contact for your job search. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">At least one
phone number should be listed; make sure to indicate if you are listing
a home or a mobile number. If you have a professional web site, you can
include the address to it along with your contact information. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Please note,
only do so if there isn&rsquo;t anything on the web site that is
personal; the only reason your potential employer may want to look at a
web site is if your professional portfolio or a copy of your CV can
be found there. Whether you decide to create a chronological or a
functional CV, you will need to separate the information by
headings. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The best advice
we can give you is to keep the section headings professional and stick
to the basics. Don&rsquo;t try to come up with creative titles for your
professional summary, or for your qualifications. Your chronological CV
should have the following sections/titles: </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">

 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A functional CV
is slightly different, and the headings you chose will truly
depend on the skills you are trying to highlight. You should include:</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Career </span><br

<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These are the
typical sections of chronological and functional CVs. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do some research
on CV styles and find sample CVs of professionals in your
industry. You may need to adjust these headings based on your field,
although the content should be consistent across industries. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Stick to the
basics; don&rsquo;t try to be creative in order to stand out. A
professional and polished CV will get you noticed, so do your best
to create a CV that is error free and best supports your career
objective. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">THE CV
LENGTH GUIDELINES: </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Keep It Short
One of the main titles asked about CVs is, &ldquo;Do I have to
include everything on one page?&rdquo; The most common misconception of
CV writing is that your entire professional history has to fit
within one 8 &frac12;&rdquo;x11&rdquo; page of white paper. The truth
is, the CV should be well written and concise, and should promote
your qualifications in the best possible light. This is sometimes
impossible to do in one page. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Thus, a CV
can extend to multiple pages, with some consideration depending on your
career level. Be concise. This is critical. Do not use lengthy
sentences and paragraph forms to disclose your experience and your
education. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Employers want
straight forward statements that highlight your qualifications. A CV is
not a place to show your creative writing skills. Perfect
your CV. You have second to catch your potential employer&rsquo;s
attention. Make sure that your CV is properly formatted, and you
are not trying to fit too much copy on a single page of paper. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Create
appropriate and professional sections for your CV. Your potential
employer is more concerned with the look and content of your CV
than with its length. Longer is not better when you don&rsquo;t have
the experience to meet your career objective. If you are new to the job
market, are changing careers, or you&rsquo;ve only had one job, stick
to a one page CV. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you
don&rsquo;t have the experience to meet your career objective, no
matter the reason, do not apologize for it.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Don&rsquo;t try
to fill up your CV with irrelevant content; instead do your best to
highlight your transferable skills, and stick to the &ldquo;short and
sweet.&rdquo; Unless you are applying for an executive-level job, or
are composing curriculum vitae, your CV should not exceed two
pages. The purpose of a well-written CV is to sell you as the best
candidate for the job with a confident and a straight-forward approach.
</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do not oversell
your skills. Do not list more than three to five previous positions
you&rsquo;ve help. Stick to those skills and experiences that best meet
the job requirements and your career objective. The most relevant
information has to be included on the first page. The second page
should be numbered, with your contact information included as well
(just in case the pages are separated when printed, you don&rsquo;t
want your potential employer to discard the second page of your CV
completely). </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you find
yourself going over two pages, review your CV and make sure that
you are not incorporating information that is irrelevant to your goals
or to the position you are seeking. Make sure that your professional
history warrants a CV that is three pages or longer. As mentioned
above, unless you are a senior-or executive-level professional, or you
are composing curriculum vitae, your CV should not extend to over
two pages.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you have a
longer CV, you will have to make sure that every statement on the CV is
applicable to your career goals. If you have had decades of
leadership experience for example, demonstrate that using the reverse
chronological CV style and only list those jobs that best qualify
you for the position you are seeking. If you need to include an
extensive list of publications or certifications, your CV can take
up more than three pages. Make sure that the important information is
still listed on the first page. This includes your career objective and
professional profile, and your current or most recent professional
experience. All subsequent pages need to be numbered, and include your
contact information in the heading.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">YOUR JOB
DESCRIPTION PRIORITIES </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The most
difficult and time consuming section of any CV is the listing of
your work experience, no matter the level you have reached in your
professional career. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you have just
graduated college and don&rsquo;t have any full-time professional
experience, you are concerned if your part time job and summer
internship are enough to get your foot in the door. If you are a
seasoned professional with extensive work experience, you are worried
how to fit all of your hard work on only one page.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
changing careers, you are unsure which skills best showcase your
qualifications. Listing work responsibilities on our CVs
doesn&rsquo;t get easier as our career progresses. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The key is to
consider your career objective and prioritize your work in accordance
to your goals. When people are asked about work responsibilities, they
have a tendency to disclose the routine items first. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This method can
be a costly mistake for listing your professional experiences on your
CV because it leaves all of the important and key qualifications at
the bottom of the list. To avoid falling into this practice, first put
together a list of your responsibilities on a sheet of paper. For your
initial draft, don&rsquo;t worry about how you are phrasing each
statement &ndash; just make a list of everything that you do in your
current or have done in your previous jobs. Once your list is
completed, consider all of the responsibilities you have included. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">What are the
three most important items on the list for each job? How do those items
relate to your career objective? Are there any other responsibilities
you have listed that better support your career objective than the
three you picked as the most critical to your job? You have to consider
all these titles in order to prioritize your job descriptions on
your CV. Begin each description with a power word, such as managed,
developed, communicated, etc. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Make sure that
the statements you list first quantify your achievements &ndash;
don&rsquo;t be afraid to list sales figured, customer acquisition
rates, budget and time line successes, or any other figures which help
put your responsibilities in a context of the business/field you are
working in. Also, these statements should be aligned with your career
objective. If you want to get a job in project management, letting your
employer know that you managed a team of 20 people will effectively
highlight your qualifications. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is important
to quantify your job description statements on your CV; however, as
a word of caution, do not quantify all statements, just one or two that
are most critical to your job and are goal driven. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This shows your
employer that you think in terms of exceeding your goals. All
subsequent descriptions of your responsibilities should support the
first one or two items on your list. Prioritizing doesn&rsquo;t only
apply to your job descriptions, although it is the most commonly
disregarded element in this particular area of the CV. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Achievements and
qualifications are often misrepresented because they are not ordered
properly. Same rules apply &ndash; consider which of your achievements
and your qualifications are most complimentary to your career
objective, and list them first. For example, if you are applying for a
job in customer service, list your communication skills before your
computer skills. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While both are
important, your communication skills are more in line with your career
objective, and therefore should take priority. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As a final test,
put yourself in the shoes of your employer. Cross-check the job
description and make sure that you address the qualifications required
for the job with the information on your CV. Let your potential
employer know you have what they are looking for, and you&rsquo;ll be
sure to make a great impression. </span><br
