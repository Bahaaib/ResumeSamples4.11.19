 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Three Effective Ways To Customize Your CV&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While most CVs
appear to look the same on the surface, there are key&nbsp;
areas that differentiate well-written winning CVs from those that
never make&nbsp; it into the hands of the hiring managers. To customize
your CV for the job&nbsp; that you want, pay attention to the
following three elements: CV style,&nbsp; career objective, and
personal profile.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The layout and
the style of your CV are as important as the information you&nbsp;
are including about your experience and qualifications.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The two most
commonly&nbsp; used CV styles are chronological and functional.
Chronological CV calls&nbsp; for listing your professional
expertise in order, much like the name implies, and is used those with
some to extensive professional experience. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Functional&nbsp;
CV showcases your experience by the type of qualifications you
have, and&nbsp; is typically used by those lacking professional
experience or those changing&nbsp; careers.&nbsp; While there are no
set rules on determining the best CV style to use, it is&nbsp;
important to keep in mind that the CV format can help or hurt your
chances&nbsp; to put your best foot forward. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You will want to
pick the format that will best&nbsp; highlight your qualifications and
your experience. Thus, it is important to&nbsp; understand the
difference between the two, as well as research which format is&nbsp;
more preferred in the field of your choice.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Career objective
is very important to your CV. While there is an ongoing&nbsp;
debate about the need for listing your objective on your CV,
choosing to&nbsp; include this goal statement shows that you have given
your professional growth&nbsp; some serious thought. Consider your
career objective as the first impression you&nbsp; make on your
potential employer. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Make sure that
your goals are specific and&nbsp; directional in terms of industry,
position title, and future professional&nbsp; achievements.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Many people make
a mistake of including generic statements under their career&nbsp;
objective. To be effective, your statement must tell a potential
employer that you&nbsp; know what kind of job you want, what experience
you have in order to get the&nbsp; position, and what you are willing
do to become a successful professional with&nbsp; the company.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While your
career objective tells your potential employer why you are
applying&nbsp; for the job at their organization, your professional
profile sells your expertise and&nbsp; convinces the employer that you
are the best candidate for the job. Your&nbsp; professional
summary/profile gives you the opportunity to differentiate
yourself,&nbsp; and give your employer an insight into you.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Two commonly
made mistakes for this section of the CV are poor writing&nbsp; and
inclusion of personal information. Note that your age, ethnicity,
gender,&nbsp; religious affiliations, etc. do not make a difference on
how you handle yourself&nbsp; as a business professional. Such
information should never be included in a&nbsp; CV, or any job
application materials (even when asked on a job application,&nbsp; such
information is optional and is for demographics study only).&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Make sure this
section is well written and error-free. Strong positive
statements&nbsp; about your expertise will give a good first impression
to your employer. Make&nbsp; sure to proofread the whole CV, with
emphasis to this section, as it appears&nbsp; at the start of your CV.
An effective personal statement must leave your&nbsp; employer
with an impression that you are confident, credible, and
professional.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Keep in mind
&ndash; your CV is your sales pitch, demonstrating your&nbsp;
qualifications and experience to your potential employer. Seize the
opportunity&nbsp; to put your best foot forward and you will reap the
rewards.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">HOW TO AVOID THE
TOP FIVE COMMON CV MISTAKES&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you have ever
tried to write a CV, for yourself or for someone you know,&nbsp;
you are already familiar with the fact that this is not an easy task to
take on. So&nbsp; much information goes into a CV; from your career
objective to the list of&nbsp; your qualifications, your CV should
be personal, convey confidence and set&nbsp; your best foot forward in
order to impress a potential employer. However,&nbsp; creating a
winning CV is not easy.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The following
are the most commonly made mistakes in CV composition:&nbsp;
Including references to personal web sites.&nbsp; You may wonder why
referencing a personal web site may be a mistake. What if&nbsp; you
have a sample of your graphic design work on your site that you want
your&nbsp; potential employer to see?</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It sounds like a
great idea, if the site you are&nbsp; referencing only has work-related
information available. Many people make a&nbsp; mistake of including
their personal web sites that may contain information&nbsp; potential
employers may find irrelevant (and now you are wasting their time) or
inappropriate.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">As a rule, do
not include your personal web site if it contains your photo or
other&nbsp; photos that may be viewed as inappropriate, if it contains
jokes (even if they are&nbsp; clean jokes), or your blog. In other
words, if the site you have is entirely for&nbsp; personal purposes,
you are best leaving it off your CV.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Include a link
to your web site if the pages are set up to showcase your&nbsp;
professional portfolio, a copy of your CV, reference letters,
presentations,&nbsp; photos taken for professional use, or your web
development skills.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Using very small
fonts in order to get everything to fit on one page.&nbsp; One of the
most common challenges is creating a CV that formats well on
a&nbsp; single page. As a rule, a CV should not exceed two pages.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However,
in&nbsp; recent years, it has become commonplace for professionals to
change jobs&nbsp; frequently, and listing all the experiences, in
addition to your career objective,&nbsp; education, qualifications and
references, can certainly take up a lot of space.&nbsp; Do not use a
small font in order to fit everything into your CV. There is not
a&nbsp; single area in your CV that should have a font size of less
than 10 points.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Keep in mind the
font type you are using &ndash; stick to the basics, Arial and
Times&nbsp; New Roman are your best bet. Instead of changing the font
size, review and&nbsp; revise your CV to make your statements more
concise.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Incorrect
company/school listings.&nbsp; The biggest mistake people make, without
realizing that they are making it, is&nbsp; not referring to the past
employers and/or the school(s) they&rsquo;ve attended by their&nbsp;
full names.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do not use
variations of company and school names. Don&rsquo;t use&nbsp;
abbreviations unless they are in fact part of the name. If you have
attended New&nbsp; York University, list the complete name, not just
NYU (even though it&rsquo;s&nbsp; commonly known and your employer will
likely recognize it). You don&rsquo;t want to&nbsp; appear sloppy or as
if you don&rsquo;t pay attention to details.&nbsp; Lengthy paragraphs
describing your experiences.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To list the
responsibilities you&rsquo;ve had in your past professional experience,
you&nbsp; are best off using bullet points that begin with action
verbs, such as managed,&nbsp; developed, etc. You do not need to use
full sentences, and you certainly do not&nbsp; need to use the
paragraph format. This makes the information in your CV&nbsp;
overwhelming and difficult to review quickly. Make your statements
brief and&nbsp; clear; don&rsquo;t add words to fill in space.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Typos.&nbsp; The
most important factor in achieving a winning CV is proof reading.
You&nbsp; want to put your best foot forward. If your CV contains
grammar and&nbsp; spelling problems, your potential employer will get
an impression that you are&nbsp; not detail-oriented. It is hard to
proof a document you have been working on so&nbsp; closely &ndash; use
spell check (but be ware, it will not catch everything), ask your&nbsp;
friends for help, meet with a career counselor.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do your best to
present the most&nbsp; polished CV to your potential employers.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">HOW TO FORMAT
YOUR CV TO IMPRESS EMPLOYERS&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Having a
well-formatted CV is almost as important as having a well
written&nbsp; CV. Most employers receive a stack of CVs of
qualified candidates and&nbsp; scan them quickly before they decide
whether or not hey want to read further. In&nbsp; addition to key
words, what stands out the most about your CV is its format.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is
essentially the first thing people will notice, whether on paper or in
electronic&nbsp; form.&nbsp; There are a number of rules you should
keep in mind when formatting your&nbsp; CV. First, start with a
blank page.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Avoid using
templates that are already&nbsp; available in Microsoft Word. These
templates are outdated, and they will make&nbsp; your CV appear
generic and uninviting. Additionally, these templates, while&nbsp; well
formatted in Microsoft Word, will not translate well when emailed
or&nbsp; uploaded to job search engine web sites.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You can find
samples of CVs on the Internet; search for CVs by your&nbsp;
industry to find the templates that make most sense for the job you are
seeking.&nbsp; Than work on a blank page to replicate the look and feel
of the CV you like.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Ideally, your CV
should fit on one page; if you have extensive experience,&nbsp;
limit the length of the CV to two pages, but only list experiences
and skills&nbsp; relevant to your career objective. Even if you are
applying for a job in a creative&nbsp; field, do not insert images or
pictures into your CV. If you are looking to&nbsp; show off your
creativity, you can do so in a separate portfolio of your work.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The page should
have one inch margins, top and bottom, right and left. Use left&nbsp;
justification only &ndash; as a rule, do not center the content of your
CV. The font&nbsp; and font size should be consistent. Your name,
and any headlines in your&nbsp; CV should be displayed in the same
manner. Typically, the headlines will be&nbsp; in all caps, and in
bold.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Try not to
underline any of the information in your CV. In the world of&nbsp;
Internet driven job applications, underlining in a document implies a
web link.&nbsp; Thus, using underlining for emphasis is not appropriate.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The font size
for&nbsp; headlines should not exceed 14 points; the remainder of the
text in the CV&nbsp; should not exceed 12 points.&nbsp; When trying
to align your CV, be ware of spacing and tabbing. Stay&nbsp;
consistent in the way that you are spacing out the information on the
page. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Use&nbsp; tabs,
rather than spaces. You always have to anticipate that the person you
are&nbsp; sending your CV to may have a different version of the
software than you&nbsp; and thus may not see the exactly the same CV
you are sending &ndash; it is&nbsp; possible that the margins
will reset, paragraphs will shift, bullet points will&nbsp; change
shape, etc.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This is why you
must keep the spacing consistent, as well as&nbsp; try to keep the font
and the bullet points as basic as possible.&nbsp; As a last formatting
check point, ask your friends or your family for help in&nbsp;
reviewing your CV.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Send the CV
file via email to a few of your friends &ndash;&nbsp; ask them to
review the CV and make sure nothing seems out of place. Print&nbsp;
out the CV on paper and review to make sure that margins are
accurately&nbsp; set, and that the content doesn&rsquo;t appear crowded
on the page.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Keep in mind
&ndash;&nbsp; when it comes to your CV, sleek simple appearance,
and great writing, will&nbsp; get you the job you are looking
for.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br
