 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">How
To Make Your CV Unique&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">A CV is a
one-to two-page document summarizing your career objectives,&nbsp;
professional experiences and achievements, and educational background.
To&nbsp; stand apart from other candidates, you should consider the
information in your&nbsp; CV carefully and make sure that it is
personal to you. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Here are three
tips on&nbsp; making your CV unique to you:&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">1. Customize
your career objective. Think of your whole CV as a sales&nbsp;
tool; your career objective is your opening statement. You want
your&nbsp; employer to know what you want, not just restate what other
people want.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">State your
commitment to your career goal. If you are unsure of what you&nbsp;
want, how is your employer to believe that you really want the job at
their&nbsp; organization and you are not just applying because you want
to get out of&nbsp; your current work environment? Don&rsquo;t be
afraid to state what you want&nbsp; from a job and from an
organization.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">2. While you
want to state your commitment, you also want to show that you&nbsp; are
willing to take action to achieve your goal. Indicate what direction
or&nbsp; action you are willing to take in order to accomplish your
career objective.&nbsp; Lastly, be specific about what you are looking
for in a work situation. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While&nbsp; you
can say that you are looking for a &ldquo;challenging&rdquo;
environment, this&nbsp; doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to your employer,
as people define challenges in&nbsp; various ways. Avoid using generic
and broad terms. Simply state what you&nbsp; want, and what you are
willing to do to get it.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">3. Highlight the
best elements of your experience. This is the most commonly&nbsp;
missed aspect of writing a CV. The entire professional
experience&nbsp; section on your CV is unique to you. Take
advantage of that. Use&nbsp; power words to list your responsibilities,
and make sure that you have a&nbsp; winning attitude in each of
statement.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">4. Focus on
those responsibilities that best describe the skills you acquired&nbsp;
while in each job that make you the most qualified candidate for
the&nbsp; position you are seeking. Quantify your responsibilities when
possible to&nbsp; showcase to your potential employer that you are
drive by results and are&nbsp; capable of exceeding goals. Don&rsquo;t
be shy about promoting your&nbsp; qualifications &ndash; you earned
them with your hard work and dedication.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">5. Personalize
your cover letter. The biggest mistake professionals make is&nbsp; not
spending any time on their cover letter. Your cover letter should&nbsp;
receive the same attention as your CV as they go
hand-in-hand.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Address your
cover letter to the appropriate person at the company&nbsp; (contact
info is typically listed in the job description). Make sure to
mention&nbsp; what position you are applying for, and demonstrate how
the information in&nbsp; your CV aligns well with the job
requirements.&nbsp; Your cover letter also allows you to address any
information in your CV that&nbsp; may raise titles &ndash; take
the time to do so, as you don&rsquo;t want your CV&nbsp; discarded
because you chose not to create a personalized cover letter. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Overall, make
sure that your cover letter supports your CV and presents you as
the&nbsp; most qualified candidate for the job.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">ELECTRONIC
CVS&nbsp; There are two most commonly used methods for electronic CV
submission:&nbsp; uploading your CV to the employer&rsquo;s
web site or to the CV bank, and e- mailing your CV to the
employer. Faxing or mailing your CV is virtually&nbsp; an obsolete
practice, because employers are heavily relying on software&nbsp;
programs that scan CVs for key words related to the available
positions at their organizations.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However, printed
CVs are necessary for interviews. Thus, professionals&nbsp;
essentially have to have two versions of their CV. While there are
numerous&nbsp; resources for composing a more traditionally formatted
CV, many&nbsp; professionals are not sure how to create electronic CVs
that will get noticed. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Create a plain
text file of your CV. While you want certain items on&nbsp; your CV to
stand out, you should still have a plain text file (.txt
file) of&nbsp; your CV. Most employers request a plain text file,
because they can&nbsp; run the file through computer software that
scans your CV for key&nbsp; words related to the available jobs. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When creating a
text file, makes sure&nbsp; that you take the time to format the CV;
check spacing and adjust any&nbsp; lines of text that seem out
of place.&nbsp; Follow instructions of your potential employer. If the
employer is asking&nbsp; that you send your CV in the body of the
e-mail, do not send them an&nbsp; attachment. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Copy and paste
the plain text CV you have created into&nbsp; the body of the
email; take the time to check for potential formatting&nbsp; changes.
Do not try to format the text by making portions of your CV&nbsp;
bold, or change the font size or type. While you may have the email
editor&nbsp; which allows for this formatting, your potential employer
may only accept&nbsp; plain text messages. Stick to the basics for a
successful transmission of your CV.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do Not save your
CV as a PDF. This file type is typically larger in size, and&nbsp;
is not very common for an electronic CV, that your potential
employer may&nbsp; completely discard your email.&nbsp; Test your
electronic CV by sending it to a few friends via email.
Because&nbsp; they may be using different e-mail providers, or have
different software than you,&nbsp; they can let you know how your CV
appears to them.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">This will help
you in&nbsp; uncovering and correcting potential formatting problems,
to assure that your&nbsp; CV is in great form by the time it
reaches potential employers.&nbsp; Do Not make an assumption that
including a CV in the body of an email is&nbsp; the only
information you should include in your message to your potential&nbsp;
employer. Even if the CV is copied into the email, you still need
to let your&nbsp; employer know a little bit more about yourself via a
cover letter. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">However,
since&nbsp; you will include your address at the top of the email, feel
free to start your&nbsp; CV with a career objective instead of
including the heading with your name&nbsp; and
address.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">INFORMATIVE TIPS
FOR EMAILING YOUR CV&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In order to seek
out and apply for the jobs you are interested in, you will most likely
post your profile and CV on a job search web site, such as&nbsp;
monster.com or hotjobs.com.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">These search
engines allow you to upload your&nbsp; CV in a Microsoft Word or
text file format, or create one using their forms.&nbsp; Outside of the
job search web sites, e-mailing your CV as form of&nbsp;
application has become commonplace. However, each employer or
headhunter&nbsp; has different rules on the file they will accept via
e-mail. Most companies will&nbsp; accept an attachment in Microsoft
Word &ndash; this is why you have to be conscious&nbsp; of the font
type and size, as well as margins you are using when composing&nbsp;
your CV.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If a company is
requesting a text file, you should follow these&nbsp; steps to convert
your Microsoft Word document into a text CV: Select File, Save
As&nbsp; Name the file; as a best practice, use your name as the file
name, and use&nbsp; underscores as spaces&nbsp; Under Format, select
Text Only&nbsp; Select Save&nbsp; Now that you have converted your file
to a text file, make sure to open it and&nbsp; review how the spaces,
tabs, and bullet points have transferred over. You may&nbsp; need to do
some edits in order to format the CV to fit the file type.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Note that&nbsp;
the plain text file doesn&rsquo;t allow for bold, italicizing or
underlining. Make sure that&nbsp; all your text is left justified and
that the spacing is correct.&nbsp; If an employer asks that you include
your CV in the body of an email, treat&nbsp; this as a text file
when formatting. Copy and paste your whole CV in an&nbsp; email.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Keep the font
styles basic; use Arial or Times New Roman fonts and keep&nbsp; the
size at 10 or 12 points. Adjust all the spacing and bullet points
as&nbsp; appropriate. A good rule to follow is to keep the email simple
&ndash; avoid bold or&nbsp; italicizing text since you don&rsquo;t
really know the type of email software your&nbsp; recipient is using or
if the accept HTML or text emails only.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If you are
sending your CV as an attachment, format the body of your
email&nbsp; as a cover letter. At the top of the email, include your
name and address, as well&nbsp; as the address of your recipient.
Typically, the address can be found either on&nbsp; the job listing or
at the company&rsquo;s web site. If you are sending the CV in
the&nbsp; body of the email, follow the same guidelines in terms of the
email content.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Don&rsquo;t make
an assumption that including a CV in the body of an email is
the&nbsp; only information you should include in your message to your
potential employer.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">If the CV is
copied into the email, you still need to let your employer know a&nbsp;
little bit more about yourself via a cover letter. However, since you
will include&nbsp; your address at the top of the email, feel free to
start your CV with a career&nbsp; objective instead of including
the heading with your name and address.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Much like
proofing is critical in perfecting your CV, testing how your CV&nbsp;
is displayed in a body of an email or how it opens as an
attachment via another&nbsp; computer is important. Rally your friends
or family for help, and send them&nbsp; sample emails with your CV
included in the body of the message or as an&nbsp; attachment. This
will provide a great opportunity for you to assure that your&nbsp; CV
is reaching your potential employers in the format that is clean
and&nbsp; professional.</span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">PRINTED
CVS&nbsp; As professionals, we rely on the Internet to search for
jobs and on e-mail to&nbsp; apply for them. We create our CVs and
cover letters to fit the electronic&nbsp; format, so it is not a
surprise that having to print out a CV can result in&nbsp; concerns
and mistakes.&nbsp; First, let&rsquo;s discuss when a printed CV is
needed.</span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">While you are
completing&nbsp; numerous job applications online, you still need to
have a printed CV to&nbsp; bring on an interview with you. You also
must keep in mind that it is very likely&nbsp; your potential employer
will print out your CV from a job search web site or&nbsp; from the
message you sent expressing your interest in the job. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Thus, it is
very&nbsp; important that you print out a test copy before submitting
your CV to&nbsp; employers to assure the layout is what you want it
to be.&nbsp; As a rule, when printing out your CV, make sure to use
white or ivory paper.&nbsp; You can get a stack of CV paper at any
office supplies store. You will want&nbsp; your CV to appear as
clean and professional. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do not use color
paper, or&nbsp; change the color of the font in order to make your CV
stand out; your&nbsp; employer will find this unprofessional and
childish, which is not the first&nbsp; impression you want to make. If
your CV is longer than one page, print out&nbsp; multiple
pages.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Don&rsquo;t
print on the front and the back of a single page; rather, include
headings in&nbsp; your CV file, indicating page numbers and print
each page on its own sheet&nbsp; of paper. You should not have any
handwriting on your CV; make sure that&nbsp; page numbers are in
fact printed along with the rest of the CV content.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Make sure that
you let your CV sit on the printer for a few moments before&nbsp;
picking it up. This will help you avoid smudging the ink of the paper,
especially if&nbsp; you are using an Ink Jet printer. You want to
assure that the CV doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp; have any smudging, stains,
or crumpling when you are handing it to your&nbsp; potential employer. </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">First
impressions are important &ndash; you don&rsquo;t want yours to
be&nbsp; that of someone who is sloppy and careless.&nbsp; When going
in for an interview, you should bring multiple copies of your CV&nbsp;
with you. Some people think this is not necessary because
your potential&nbsp; employer already has your CV. This is a common
misconception. You&nbsp; should always have several copies of your CV
printed out and with you&nbsp; when at an interview.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Often times, the
hiring manager may ask another associate to meet you during&nbsp; the
interviewing process, and he/she may not have a copy of your CV.&nbsp;
Having extras makes you look professional, prepared and
organized, which&nbsp; helps you set your best foot forward.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Additionally, it
is helpful that the copy of the CV you bring in for an
interview&nbsp; has a complete list of references. You can include the
references directly on&nbsp; your CV (typically at the bottom of
the page), or you can include a separate&nbsp; sheet of paper with the
list. </span><br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">The first option
is preferred, because it provides the&nbsp; employer with all of the
critical information about you in one place. Including&nbsp; your
references preempts the employer from asking you for this information;
it&nbsp; also shows that you are seriously interested in the available
position.&nbsp; </span><br
 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Having a
well-formatted, clean and professional CV will only help you
make&nbsp; a great first impression, and help you get the job you are
truly interested in. </span><br
