              A Healthier Diet</b></big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>If you're one of the many people who think that
            eating healthy is expensive and doesn't taste very good,
            think again! Eating a healthy diet can be very simple and
            easy, as well as delicious! Read on for some easy tips on
            eating delicious food that's good for your body.</big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>Keep a close count of your daily caloric intakes.
            Get educated about what the caloric requirements are for you
            personally. Take this into consideration as you plan your
            meals throughout the day. Consider eating five to six mini
            meals a day instead of the traditional three. This will help
            you to maintain a healthy weight.</big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>Breakfast is really the most important meal of the
            day. It has been repeated so often that it has become a
            clichÃ©, but the fact remains that you should not skip
            breakfast. Even if you are not hungry, eating a healthy
            breakfast will ensure that your body has the fuel it needs
            to make it through the day.</big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>For a healthy, quick, tasteful snack, try pureeing
            some peaches, berries or pears. This will make a sweet
            spread that you can put on pita chips or use as a dip for
            pretzels. You can experiment with any type of fruit that you
            like and mix it up often, so you don't get sick of this
            healthy snack.</big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>Try to eat more white meat in your diet everyday.
            Most protein comes from animal fat and this kind provides
            the least amount versus red meat. You can find tasty white
            meat in turkey, chicken and even pork. Add these to items
            such as sandwiches, salads, stews, soups, etc; the
            possibilities are endless.</big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>Eat nuts for a snack instead of crackers. Even
            though nuts are higher in fat content, eating only a small
            amount can satisfy your hunger for a longer period of time.
            Crackers are mainly carbohydrates. You will need to eat more
            of that to satisfy your hunger over the same period of time,
            leading to eating more calories. So, in the long run, nuts
            are better snacks.</big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>If you are interested in adding salmon or tuna to
            your diet because they are high in minerals but you do not
            know how to cook them, you can buy canned versions. You just
            have to make sure that the ones you buy are packed it water
            and not in oil so they won't be loaded with excess fat and
            calories.</big></big></div>
      <div><big><big><br>
          </big></big></div>
      <div><big><big>Eating the right diet that supports exercise levels
            and gives the body the required materials to rebuild itself,
            is a key component to physical fitness. Having the right
            amount of protein will allow for muscle growth. Providing
            enough carbohydrates will give the body fuel for the day.
            The right diet makes a big difference.</big></big></div>
