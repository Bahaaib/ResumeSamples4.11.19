    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          This recipe incorporates broccoli into a baked potato.
          Broccoli is an
          excellent source of fiber and cancer-fighting antioxidants.
          Potatoes
          are a universally loved vegetable loaded with vitamins C and
          B-6,
          potassium and fiber. And, best of all, this recipe is low in
          fat. You
          can make the stuffed potatoes ahead and reheat them when
          everyone is
          ready to eat.<br>
          <br>
          3 large baking potatoes<br>
          2 large stalks broccoli<br>
          1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
          1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil<br>
          1 to 2 tablespoons low-fat milk, rice milk or soy milk<br>
          2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese<br>
          <br>
          Scrub the potatoes and make shallow cuts around their middles
          to make
          it easier to cut them in half after baking. Bake the potatoes
          at 400
          degrees F until soft, about 1 hour, depending on the size of
          the
          potatoes.<br>
          <br>
          Meanwhile, cut the ends from the stalks of broccoli and peel
          some of
          the outer skin off to make the stems more edible. Steam the
          broccoli
          until crunchy-tender and bright green. Drain and chop fine.<br>
          <br>
          Cut potatoes in half and scoop out the insides into a bowl.
          Add the
          salt, olive oil and just enough rice or soy milk to allow you
          to mash
          the potatoes into a smooth paste. Add the Parmesan cheese and
          the
          chopped broccoli and mix well.<br>
          <br>
          Pile the mixture back into the potato shells, arrange on a
          baking dish
          and heat them to desired temperature.<br>
