    <div align="center"><b><big><big>Pork Medallions with a Port &amp;
            Cranberry Pan Sauce</big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><br>
        Makes 4 servings<br>
        <br>
        Ingredients:<br>
        <br>
        1/4 cup dried cranberries<br>
        1/4 cup port<br>
        1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed<br>
        1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil<br>
        2 cloves garlic, peeled and halved<br>
        1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar<br>
        2 sage leaves<br>
        1/2 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth<br>
        Salt &amp; freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
        <br>
        Method:<br>
        <br>
        In a small bowl, combine the port and cranberries. Slice
        tenderloin into 1 ½ inch medallions. Place the medallions
        between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound with the bottom of
        a saucepan until they are ½ inch thick. Season both sides with
        salt and pepper.<br>
        <br>
        On a medium to high heat sear the medallions in the oil on one
        side until they are golden brown, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
        Turn and sear them on the other side for 4 to 5 minutes; turn
        them again and continue cooking until golden brown and no longer
        pink in the middle.<br>
        <br>
        Remove to a serving platter and loosely cover to keep warm.<br>
        <br>
        Add the garlic to the pan and return to a medium - high heat,
        cooking for one minute whilst stirring continuously. Add the
        cranberries, port, vinegar and sage leaves and cook for one
        minute. Pour in the broth and bring to the boil. Continue to
        cook until the sauce thickens and is reduced by half. Remove the
        garlic and sage and spoon the sauce over the pork and serve.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big>Sweet Potato &amp; Red Pepper Pasta</big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><br>
        This recipe is a great way to use "power vegetables" sweet
        potato and red bell peppers in an enjoyable vegetarian pasta
        dish which is full of fresh herbs and creamy goats cheese. The
        tarragon can be substituted with any fresh herbs that you have
        such as basil, oregano, sorrel or chives.<br>
        <br>
        Makes 4 servings<br>
        <br>
        Ingredients:<br>
        <br>
        8 ounces whole-wheat angel hair pasta<br>
        2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided<br>
        4 cloves garlic, minced<br>
        3 cups shredded, peeled sweet potato<br>
        1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced<br>
        1 cup diced plum tomatoes<br>
        2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley<br>
        1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon<br>
        1 tablespoon white-wine vinegar or lemon juice<br>
        1/2 cup crumbled goats cheese<br>
        1/2 cup water<br>
        3/4 teaspoon salt<br>
        <br>
        Method:<br>
        <br>
        Bring a large pot of water to the boil and cook the pasta until
        just tender.<br>
        <br>
        In a large skillet, place 1 tablespoon of oil and the garlic and
        cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally until the garlic
        is sizzling and fragrant. Add the sweet potato, bell pepper,
        tomatoes and water and cook until the bell pepper is tender,
        approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and keep
        warm.<br>
        <br>
        Drain the pasta, reserving half a cup of the cooking water.
        Return the pasta to the pot and add the vegetable mix, the
        remaining 1 tablespoon of oil, parsley, tarragon, vinegar (or
        lemon juice), salt and cheese. Toss to combine all of the
        ingredients. Add the reserved pasta water, 2 tablespoons at a
        time, until you have achieved the desired consistency.<br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big>Seared Steaks with Caramelized
            Onions &amp; Gorgonzola</big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><br>
        I think I can safely say that steak is at its best when it is
        topped with caramelized onions and salty Gorgonzola cheese. For
        this recipe it is worth purchasing a good quality Gorgonzola in
        order to achieve the best flavor. This dish can be served with
        mashed potato and steamed carrots.<br>
        <br>
        Makes 4 servings<br>
        <br>
        Ingredients:<br>
        <br>
        2 tablespoons canola oil, divided<br>
        2 large onions, sliced<br>
        1 tablespoon brown sugar<br>
        1/2 cup reduced-sodium beef broth<br>
        1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar<br>
        1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
        1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper<br>
        1 pound beef tenderloin or sirloin steak, trimmed and cut into 4
        steaks<br>
        1/4 cup crumbled Gorgonzola <br>
        <br>
        Method:<br>
        <br>
        In a large skillet heat 1 tablespoon of oil over a medium heat.
        Add the onions and brown sugar and cook until the onions are
        tender and golden brown, approximately 15 minutes. Add the
        broth, vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon of salt and stir until the
        liquid has almost evaporated. Transfer the onions to a bowl and
        cover to keep warm. Clean and dry the pan.<br>
        <br>
        Sprinkle the remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt and pepper on both
        sides of the steak. Heat the remaining oil over a medium heat in
        the pan. Add the steaks and cook until browned, approximately 3
        to 5 minutes. Turn them over and top with the cheese. Reduce the
        heat and cover and cook until the cheese is melted and the
        steaks are cooked. Serve the steaks with the caramelized onions.<br>

        1 cup thinly sliced seeded cucumber<br>
        3/4 cup nonfat plain yogurt<br>
        1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint<br>
        2 teaspoons lemon juice<br>
        Freshly ground salt and pepper<br>
        4 to 6 inch whole-wheat pitas, warmed<br>
        1 cup shredded lettuce<br>
        2 small tomatoes<br>

        Method:<br>
        <br>
        Preheat the grill to medium-high.<br>
        <br>
        Sprinkle the chicken with 1 teaspoon of garam masala and 1/2
        teaspoon salt. Place the chicken on the grill and cook until it
        is no longer pink in the middle, approximately 4 to 8 minutes
        per side, depending on the size of the breast. Transfer the
        chicken to a clean cutting board and allow to rest for 5
        minutes.<br>
        <br>
        In a small bowl combine the cucumber, yogurt, mint, lemon juice,
        salt, pepper, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon garam masala.
        Thinly slice the chicken. Split open the warm pitas and fill
        with the chicken, yogurt sauce, lettuce, tomato and onion.<br>
