            You may not believe this but there are actually a countless
            number of slow cooker recipes for people who are on a
            low-fat diet. Apparently,
            such low fat slow cooker recipes are intended for people who
            are watching
            their health and their weight very carefully. In this
            regard, we would
            want to share at least two of the low fat slow cooker
            recipes that most
            dieters prefer to prepare.<br>

          <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Arroz Con Pollo is one type of a low fat slow cooker recipe
            that we
            highly suggest. You will need to prepare such ingredients as
            two
            tablespoons of freshly chopped cilantro, two cups of cooked
            rice, ten
            ounces of frozen peas that have been thawed, two tablespoons
            of red
            wine, one half cup of chicken broth, eight pieces of chicken
            thighs
            that do not have skin, two teaspoons of chili powder, one
            teaspoon of
            oregano, one clove of crushed garlic, one fourth teaspoon of
            pepper,
            and one half teaspoon of salt.<br>
          </font>
          <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Mix such ingredients as chili powder, oregano, garlic,
            pepper, and salt
            together in a bowl. Such spice mixture should be sprinkled
            all over the
            chicken pieces. Once each of the chicken pieces is sprinkled
            with the
            spice mixture, you may place all of them in a slow cooker.
            The wine and
            the broth should then be poured all over the chicken pieces.
            Cover the slow cooker and let it cook for at least five to
            six hours using low
            temperature. After five to six hours, remove the chicken and
            set the slow cooker on high temperature. Add the peas soon
            thereafter and cover
            the slow cooker again and let the ingredients be cooked for
            another seven
            to ten minutes. The cooked rice as well as the chicken
            should then be
            added into the slow cooker. Before serving, make sure to
            sprinkle the
            freshly chopped cilantro on the dish.<br>

          <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            Another low fat slow cooker recipe that we suggest is the
            recipe for
            Basil Chicken. This is also an easy-to-prepare dish as it
            only requires
            few ingredients and can also be cooked while the slow cooker
            is running
            unattended.<br>
          </font>
          <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            The ingredients include one half whole green pepper that is
            sliced, one
            can of cream of celery soup, one half teaspoon basil, one
            half teaspoon
            of pepper, and four whole chicken breasts that are skinless.<br>
          </font>
          <font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
            To begin the procedure for this low fat slow cooker recipe,
            you must
            place first the skinless chicken breasts in the slow cooker.
            The chicken
            should then be sprinkled with basil and pepper. The cream of
            celery
            soup should then be poured over the chicken pieces.
            Afterwards, the
            sliced green pepper should be placed on top of the chicken
            that is
            covered with soup. Cover the slow cooker and let it cook for
            approximately eight hours. The slow cooker should be set on
            low
            temperature for this low fat slow cooker recipe. You do not
            have to wait
            for eight hours for this recipe to be cooked. There are
            instances when
            six or seven hours will do. This recipe only contains four
            grams of fat
            and is composed of 55 grams of protein and three grams of
            carbohydrates.<br>
