          Whenever you start a major new hobby, its best to take a few
          minutes and think about what you are getting into. A lot of
          new hobbies require a significant investment of time and
          money. This is certainly true of golf, skydiving, scuba and
          home brewing. So along with a plan on how to get started, its
          good to have a good plan for getting ready to plunge into home
          brewing full scale. If you have a road map for "checking it
          out", you can determine if home brewing will fit into your
          lifestyle and your budget.<br>
          <br>
          "Looking before you leap" means that you find out what it
          means to be involved in the hobby or sport as a full time
          member of that hobby community. When it comes to home brewing,
          that will only happen when you too can make your own beer at
          home. And when that time finally gets here and you can play
          with the recipes and make the taste of your own beer very
          unique, that will be an exciting moment for you. But a mature
          approach to this very adult hobby means checking it out and
          knowing the investment of time, money and space in the home
          before you spend your first dollar to get set up as a home
          brewer.<br>
          <br>
          An easy and fun way to ease into the hobby of home brewing
          that doesn't cost a cent is to begin to network with those who
          are already well into their passion for making beer. You can
          find forums online to use to learn more about getting started.
          And there are almost certainly a number of home brewing
          societies and clubs in town that you can find out about online
          or through your local retail brewing supply store. These
          social connections will be people who are very much
          "evangelists" for home brewing because they know the fun of
          it. So you will get plenty of chances to sit in with a new
          friend to step through the brewing process and not only learn
          what equipment you will need but how it is used as you get
          training from an "old pro" in home beer making.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have gotten some basic training the free route
          through home brewing gurus, the time will come when you are
          ready to consider buying your own equipment and taking a stab
          at it yourself. But you have already witnessed that home
          brewing is a big event in the house filling up the kitchen,
          the refrigerator, making a mess sometimes and requiring places
          to store, refrigerate and ferment the beer in the various
          stages from ingredients to finished product.<br>
          <br>
          So it is important that the hobby of home brewing not just be
          your solitary passion but if at all possible you get the
          family into the act. If they can attend meetings at the home
          brewing club or go to competitions or other events that are
          all about home brewing, they can catch the same enthusiasm you
          have. That enthusiasm will be very important particularly in
          your significant other because each brewing session will be a
          major event in the house involving the kitchen with lots of
          pans and bottles and equipment. So having your wife or husband
          fully onboard with the process and even working on it together
          makes the fun of home brewing even more fulfilling.<br>
          <br>
          Another area of looking before you leap is to plan out not
          only how you will use all of the equipment you will buy but
          how you will handle issues of storage. It’s a very pragmatic
          concern but if you bring in this arsenal of beer making
          equipment. Between batches it is going to have to be
          somewhere. And while you will enjoy that equipment a great
          deal, you don’t want it to dominate the home.<br>
          <br>
          By getting a feel for the equipment when you are preparing to
          start your home brewing hobby, you can prepare a storage space
          for the equipment when it is not in use. Think ahead about
          storage for the fermentation phase of brewing as well as
          storing up to five gallons of beer per finished batch. But by
          thinking ahead, when you become a very active home brewer, you
          will have your family and facilities all ready for the
          changes. And that is looking before you leap into the exciting
          world of making and enjoying your own home made beer.<br>
