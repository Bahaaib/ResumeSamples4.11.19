          Beer is about a lot more than just a great tasting beverage.
          The fact that a culture has grown up around the joy of making
          and enjoying fine beer testifies how much beer has become part
          of how our culture works. The drinking of the beverage is only
          partially about the taste of the brew itself and very much
          about where you have your beer, what you drink it out of, how
          the beer looks in the glass and who you are drinking it with.
          And while you as a home made beer brewer cannot control many
          of those factors, you can control the quality and ambiance of
          the beer you make so it not only tastes great but is visually
          appealing as well.<br>
          <br>
          If you pour a commercial beer from a bottle or a can, you may
          not be aware of how much those beer makers put into not just
          the taste but the affect of other senses have on the beer
          drinking experience. The way the beer pours, the aroma as you
          pour it, the head that wells up in your mug and how the beer
          looks in the glass all are just as important as the taste
          itself. The emphasis the big beer producers put on ascetics is
          so extreme that they even make the sound the can makes when
          you "pop a cold one" to be unique because they know that sound
          alone can prepare you to receive the taste of a great beer
          drinking experience.<br>
          <br>
          The truth is none of that will change whether the beer itself
          is of high quality or is good to drink. But visual appeal
          matters. One area of visual appeal that you have some control
          over when making your own beer at home is clarity. Clarity
          simply refers to how the beer looks in the glass. If you can
          see through the beer and it is a consistent beige or amber
          color, that is visually appealing. But if things are floating
          around in the beer, even if they are perfectly harmless
          byproducts of the brewing process, that can diminish how
          inviting your beer is to enjoy and even diminish how enjoyable
          the beer is to drink even if the beer itself is of high
          quality.<br>
          <br>
          A lot of the "stuff" that floats around is beer comes from the
          yeast that is crucial to the fermentation process that makes
          beer beer. Some yeasts are better than others about settling
          out of the beer during fermentation. Another source of visible
          material in the beer comes from what is referred to as
          non-microbiological particles or NMPs which are a byproduct of
          the brewing process. Again, none of these visible materials
          are harmful to consume nor do they reduce the value of the
          beer. They just look bad and hurt the clarity of the beer
          which is one way beer is measured for quality.<br>
          <br>
          Many of the NMPs are introduced during the initial creation of
          the wort which is phase one of any brewing operation. The wort
          is boiled at a high temperature for a significant enough
          period of time to cause the proteins in the ingredients to
          break down and become part of the fluidity of the wort rather
          than remain in a substance state or a "floc" which remains
          visible in the finished product. To avoid this make sure your
          boil sustains a temperature of 215F for 90 minutes to assure
          complete processing of the proteins.<br>
          <br>
          Another important brewing step that you can do to reduce
          visible agents in your beer is to cool the wort very quickly.
          By bringing the temperature down rapidly, the clarity is
          vastly enhanced as is the flavor and overall quality of the
          beer. The best way to accomplish such rapid cooling is to move
          the wort quickly from the brewing process to a very cool
          environment or using a specialized wort cooler to quickly
          bring that temperature down and eliminate many of the flocs
          that might be there if the cooling goes more slowly.<br>
          <br>
          Seeking beer clarity can become a major passion of yours as a
          home brewer and there is a whole science to using clarifying
          agents such as Irish Moss to enhance beer clarity without
          diminishing beer quality or taste. Learning good techniques
          for making your beer clear and appealing is just another step
          in your ongoing quest to become the best amateur beer making
          possible. <br>
          <br>
          And that is a quest worth pursuing.<br>
