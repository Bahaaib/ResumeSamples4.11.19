          Have you ever wondered, "How do I make homemade beer?"<br>
          <br>
          Making beer (also known as ale) at home is actually very
          simple and fun. Home brewing is neither difficult nor
          complicated, once one has gotten the hang of it and learned
          all the steps.<br>
          <br>
          Brewing ale at home is becoming more popular and has grown
          significantly in recent years. Different people take on the
          hobby of home brewing for different reasons. Many have learned
          that setting up and obtaining good homebrew equipment/supplies
          is truly not very expensive or problematic.<br>
          <br>
          Some of us love the social aspect of joining a community (both
          local and international) of brewers, whether it be via the
          Internet or in their hometown. Others just find it very
          enjoyable assembling the equipment, learning the recipes, and
          following the steps for making their own homebrewed batch of
          delicious beer, not to mention taking that first taste of a
          fresh brew that is homemade! Even if a batch of beer does turn
          out to be a disaster (which it may or may not your first time
          around), just consider it part of your learning process, which
          will help you to make even better beer next time!<br>
          <br>
          Another reason people turn to home brewing their own beer is
          the power of choice one has when home brewing. There are tons
          of different recipes available out there, in addition to being
          able to make a variety of strengths, light versus dark beers,
          flavors of beer, etc.<br>
          <br>
          Not only do people who have started this hobby discover how
          much fun it is doing their own home brewing, they have also
          discovered that homebrewed beer is unquestionably much more
          fresh and better tasting than any they have ever bought from a
          store or ordered at a bar/pub!<br>
          <br>
          It is absolutely beyond gratifying for many, including myself,
          to serve freshly home brewed beer to guests, followed by the
          words of praise one gets when his or her friends rave about
          the freshness of the homebrew beer that has been served!<br>
          <br>
          Making your own homebrewed beer does require some patience,
          and although it does not take forever for a batch of homebrew
          you have made yourself to be ready for you to consume, that
          first batch will seem to take absolutely forever before it is
          ready for you to enjoy!<br>
          <br>
          You will also be delighted to learn that there is some, but
          not a whole lot, of beer brewing equipment needed for brewing
          ale from home! You will need to invest in some specialized
          equipment to use for home brewing your own beer, but once you
          have invested in this, your only expense thereafter will be
          your ingredients for your next batch of fresh brew!<br>
          <br>
          With the continued development of new web sites, eBooks,
          articles, and forums available on the Internet about brewing
          beer at home, you will definitely have any assistance you may
          need at your fingertips, to either help you get started or
          help you along the way after you get started. You will also
          find it rewarding, after you have become a seasoned homebrew
          maker, to provide your knowledge to others who have just
          started embarking on this adventure!<br>
          <br>
          LET'S BREW!<br>
          <br>
          I have listed below some primary steps needed for brewing beer
          at home. (Please be aware that the information below contains
          the basics only, and you will need more information than what
          I have provided. Please choose a recipe and then follow the
          detailed instructions as per that recipe.) Before you begin
          the actual brewing process, you will need to do the following:<br>
          <br>
          Gather and measure needed amounts of all your ingredients,
          which will include malt extract, hops, specialty grains, and
          yeast - the type of yeast you will use will be dependent on
          what type of beer you are brewing.<br>
          <br>
          Sanitize all of your equipment. You can do this a couple
          different ways - my suggestions are that you either use your
          home dishwasher set at high heat or use a sanitizing agent
          such as Powdered Brewery Wash (PBW). Make sure if you are
          using an agent such as PBW that you rinse all of your
          equipment thoroughly. Use of bleach on your home brewing
          equipment is not advised, as this can cause your brew to have
          a different flavor than it otherwise would have. Use of bleach
          will also necessitate you to rinse your equipment, which is
          not advisable, as tap water can allow microorganisms to form
          on your "sterilized" equipment, thus making it no longer
          sterilized.<br>
          <br>
          Be prepared to take notes of all steps you take during the
          entire process. This will help ensure you avoid repeating
          something next time that you should not have done, or will
          help you to duplicate a great batch when you do brew a good
          one!<br>
          <br>
          The actual brewing involves the following: (Please note again
          that these are not complete instructions, just the basics to
          give you an idea of what you will be doing when you homebrew
          beer. Please refer to your recipe of choice for more detailed
          instructions.)<br>
          <br>
          Steeping the grains in a grain bag (also called a sparge bag)
          (similar to a tea bag, only much larger and more heavy duty)
          for approximately half an hour, then removing the grains and
          allowing the water to drip out of the bag into your
          kettle/pot.<br>
          <br>
          Adding the malt extract to the kettle/pot and bringing
          everything in there to a boil, with hops added at varying
          times depending on the flavor you are trying to achieve (which
          will be determined by the recipe you choose). Please note that
          adding hops to the kettle too early will cause a more
          bitter-tasting final product. Most recipes you will come
          across will let you know when hops should be added, and how
          much you will need to add for any particular recipe.<br>
          <br>
          Chilling the wort (your liquid) after it has finished boiling.
          Chilling the wort as fast as possible is very important. You
          can either purchase a wort cooler made specifically for this
          purpose, or you can simply dip the kettle containing the wort
          into a sink of ice water. If you wish, stirring will also
          assist in cooling the wort down quicker, but to avoid a change
          in the flavor of your final homebrew, try to avoid splashing
          or aerating the wort. You will want to cool your wort off to
          approximately 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Centigrade),
          at which time you can transfer your brew to the fermenter.<br>
          <br>
          Transferring the cooled wort to the fermenter. During this
          transfer, please feel free to splash, splash, splash the wort
          all you like. Splashing the wort is actually recommended, as
          doing this when it is being transferred into your fermenter
          will aid the yeast in "doing its thing."<br>
          <br>
          During the fermentation process, there are several things that
          will need to be done, including scooping out the hops with a
          strainer, adding water to make the amount you are going for (5
          gallons is a good starter amount), sealing up (putting the lid
          on and air-sealing) the fermenter, and putting the fermenter
          in a dark room or closet that will keep a somewhat consistent
          temperature. In addition, some recipes for ales or lagers will
          require that you complete this process in a refrigerated
          container. Please refer to what your particular recipe calls
          for regarding whether or not you need to refrigerate your brew
          during the fermentation process.<br>
          <br>
          Approximately 24 to 48 hours after you have placed the lid on
          the fermenter and sealed it, check the fermenter. You should
          see your air-lock gurgling (bubbling). If you do not, it is
          likely you have dead yeast. As a result, you will need to
          attempt the above process again with new ingredients and
          freshly sterilized equipment. This is not a common occurrence,
          but it does happen from time to time.<br>
          <br>
          After about 1 week, you will be ready for bottling and then
          aging the bottled brew at room temperature for about two
          weeks, after which you can refrigerate and ENJOY!<br>
          <br>
          Please note that the above instructions are very, very basic
          instructions, just to give you an idea of what the home
          brewing process consists of. Please refer to more detailed
          information (such as that you will find in the actual recipe
          you will be using) before attempting to brew.<br>
