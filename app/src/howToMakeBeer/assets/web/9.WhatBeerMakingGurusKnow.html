          The great thing about brewing your own beer is that you can be
          good at it starting out and get great at it over time. You can
          make each and every batch tasty and enjoyable but at the same
          time always be driven to make a better brew. Part of the
          function of home brewing contests and being part of your local
          brewers club is that you get those tips and learn from the old
          pros at brewing so month by month and year by year, your beer
          gets better and better.<br>
          <br>
          One important thing that the real beer gurus know is what
          great chefs know and that is the quality of beer comes down to
          the freshness of the ingredients you use. One area you can
          improve on freshness is with the yeast you use for
          fermentation. A dry yeast is simply not as fresh as liquid
          yeast so that is where one small change can dramatically
          affect the freshness of your beer. Use this same approach with
          the grains, the hops and all the perishable ingredients that
          you need for a quality home brewed batch of beer.<br>
          <br>
          But just as even if you buy fresh flour for bread, you freeze
          it to delay it getting stale and use proper refrigeration for
          all of your brewing ingredients. First of all, only buy the
          ingredients when the day you are going to brew is very near.
          And use as much as you can up in one batch. You will get a
          natural instinct for how much of each ingredient you need for
          a single run of brewing and eventually get to where you can
          buy enough, use it up the next day with little or no left over
          and in that way always be brewing with absolutely fresh
          ingredients. But even then, make some room in your freezer and
          refrigerator to slow down the aging of the things that make up
          your beer. Grains and yeast can go in the refrigerator and the
          rest in the freezer for a short time. Use your ingrediants up
          quickly. Don’t stock pile.<br>
          <br>
          Temperature control is a central issue with all home brewing
          gurus who seek absolute control over the quality of their
          product. That first step of brewing which is the boiling of
          the grains and hops to make up the "wort" is a heat intensive
          operation. But once the time of your boiling phase is done,
          bring the temperature of the wort down very quickly. By
          dropping the temperature from boiling to cooler temperature at
          a very fast pace, you will reduce the contaminations in your
          beer and your final product will have a vastly better clarity
          which is a sign of a great beer. This is one little trick of
          the trade that may take some effort and maybe even specialized
          equipment like an immersion chiller for your wort but it will
          be worth it in the quality of beer that results.<br>
          <br>
          Keeping the temperature of your finished beer constantly under
          control during fermentation is also a central issue with beer
          making gurus to make sure their beer is of the highest
          quality. If you are a devoted home brewer and want to buy a
          refrigerator just to devote to fermentation, that would be the
          best situation because you could carefully control the
          temperature.<br>
          <br>
          But there are other methods many home brewers use to assure
          their fermenting beer says at a steady temperature. You can
          select the best spot in the house where the beer will remain
          relatively cool all day. Then wrap the fermenter up using wet
          towels and then put a fan on the wrapped beer. This uses the
          humidity of the water and the coolness that comes from the fan
          to keep the beer in the best possible environment to create
          truly great tasting beer.<br>

              Hardest Part</b></font></big></big></div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          The rock music artist Tom Petty had a hit song that went, "The
          waiting is the hardest part". And when it comes to brewing
          your own beer, maybe the most difficult step of them all is
          the fermentation and aging process. After all, the steps
          leading up to the time when you wait for beer to mature is
          full of activity. From shopping for new equipment and
          ingredients, to cleaning and preparation to boiling the wort
          to cooling and preparing for fermentation, it’s a fun process.
          And that is what you want from a great hobby.<br>
          <br>
          But once you have used all of your skills (so far) to make a
          great wort that is ready to ferment and age, storing and
          waiting for that process to finish seems to take forever. If
          this is one of your first batches or if you tried a new grain
          or hops, you are eager to see how good the beer will taste.
          And you are eager to serve ice cold home made beer to friends
          and family. But you also know that if you break in and
          interrupt the process too soon, the beer you drink will be
          unsatisfactory and not nearly as rich and flavorful as how it
          will be when the aging process is done. So you wait, sometimes
          impatiently.<br>
          <br>
          One way to continue enjoying the "fun part" of home brewing is
          to have fresh batches of beer in production each week. If you
          went that route, you would eventually end up with a lot of
          beer in various stages of fermentation and aging and you would
          have to date and mark the storage bottles so you know which
          beer is ready to use and which needs more time to reach
          maturity. And when you consider that an average minimum size
          of a home beer brewing cycle results in five gallons of beer,
          that can mean you will have a lot of finished beer around
          unless you have a big audience of beer drinkers to help you
          drink up the stuff.<br>
          <br>
          The time between when beer is bottled after the brewing
          process is complete until it is ready to taste can be anywhere
          from six weeks to six months if you include both fermentation
          and aging. The actual aging process is pretty fascinating and
          understanding it helps you develop patience for nature to take
          its course. During fermentation, the yeast will work to change
          the structure of the sugar that was part of the brewing
          process. As the fermentation continues, carbon dioxide is
          created and this gives your beer that bubbly quality that is a
          big part of the appeal of the beverage.<br>
          <br>
          Fermentation also pushes sediments from the yeast and proteins
          and these sediments would hurt the taste of your beer if the
          cycle were interrupted. It's worth it to let the process
          naturally cure the beer so these unwanted byproducts naturally
          work their way out of the finished product. It does take a lot
          of patience to be a brewer, even a home brewer because
          allowing the aging process to produce perfect beer may take
          over a month or even longer. But this waiting is just as much
          a part of making great beer as the boiling and fermenting so
          you have to nurture the patient side of yourself to get a
          great outcome.<br>
          <br>
          Part of your preparation for brewing is preparing a place for
          your beer to be housed in optimum conditions for fermentation
          to work its magic. As opposed to perhaps your impression
          before you became a home brewer, you will not store the beer
          in the refrigerator during this phase because colder
          temperatures actually stop the fermentation process. That is
          why you keep milk in there.<br>
          <br>
          Instead plan to set up a "fermentation room" that wills stay
          at a constant cool temperature between 65 and 75 degrees any
          time of the year. This should be a room where you can achieve
          some temperature control so the beer stays in a stable
          environment to reach a perfect flavor. It is also a room you
          won't feel the need to go to and interrupt the fermentation
          process. You can draw some of the beer out as early as 4 weeks
          from the start of fermentation. But for the best possible
          taste for your beer, you should give this process two to four
          months for adequate aging.<br>
