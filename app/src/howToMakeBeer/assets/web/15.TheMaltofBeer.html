          We tend to think of "malt" as a thing. Of course there is the
          candy malt and there is the old fashioned "malted" that was
          the stable of 1950s "malt shops" which in our mind is more
          like a modern day milk shake. But when it comes to beer, just
          about anyone, even people who are not involved in home brewing
          can list the ingredients as hops, malt, and grains. So as part
          of our quest to become more familiar with all of the aspects
          of beer making, itâ€™s a good idea to explore more deeply what
          exactly the malt in beer is all about.<br>
          <br>
          When you hear the word "malt" in regards to the brewing of
          beer, the reference is actually to malted barley. Malt is the
          outcome of the process of malting which starts with pure
          barley grain, the same grain you might use to make muffins or
          barley soup. That is a good way to ground the concept of
          malting to something very familiar.<br>
          <br>
          But even then the term "malted barley" is not specific enough.
          Malting gets right to the heart of how beer is made because
          the core ingredient of beer are what results when the sugars
          from malted barley are fermented. Those sugars are
          scientifically named maltose, hence malt. So the malt used to
          make beer is the outcome of fermenting the sugars from malted
          barley whereas the candy or desert form of malt are those
          sugars themselves, unfermented. That makes good trivia for the
          new home brewers club meeting. But what makes brewers malt so
          useful in beers is that there are a wide variety of types of
          maltose sugars that result from the fermentation. And each of
          these can be brewed into a very unique beer.<br>
          <br>
          How malt is produced can make for even more interesting
          trivia. And it gives you insight into how the malts you use in
          your home brewing come to be. The process of malting barley
          begins with jump starting the germination process that is
          nature's way of preparing the barley plants to grow from seeds
          into sprouts. The barley is soaked and then they are drained
          fairly soon so the seeds will be stimulated to begin to
          germinate. The part of the germination process that is
          interesting to brewers happens when certain enzymes are
          released by germination. These enzymes are powerful chemicals
          that convert the stored sugars and starches in the seeds which
          become food to power the germination and growth of the plant.
          But it is those enzymes that the brewer is looking to capture.<br>
          <br>
          The entire objective of malting is to activate those enzymes
          in the seeds and release them so the brewer can capture them
          for the brewing process. So as soon as the germination process
          starts, the grain is quickly dried so the enzymes are captured
          in that raw state to be processed into malted barley. Once the
          brewer has the malted barley in the condition we just went
          through, that malt is saturated in hot water. This stimulates
          and activates the enzymes and puts them to work again. Under
          the controlled conditions of the brewing process, the enzymes
          do their job of converting the starches in the barley to
          sugars. And as those sugars go directly from conversion to be
          boiled with hops and then combined into fermented yeast, the
          result is this little thing we call -- beer.<br>
          <br>
          Now this is all good information but most of us who are making
          beer at the amateur level. For our purposes, malt extract that
          is sold by your home brewing supplier is a great way to have
          all of that skilled preparation at your disposal without you
          having to do all the work. By buying the malt in extract form,
          it is ready to go into your boiling water and join the home
          brewing process in full swing. As you add the malt, those
          enzymes will kick in and the chemical reactions needed to
          create great tasting beer will be well underway.<br>
          <br>
          Maybe there will come a time when you will get more involved
          in the more complicated procedures of brewing or at least
          visit a brewery where the malting process is underway. But
          since our love of home brewing is about learning all we can
          about how beer is made by making it ourselves, getting a feel
          or the malting process is both educational and fascinating as
          well.<br>
