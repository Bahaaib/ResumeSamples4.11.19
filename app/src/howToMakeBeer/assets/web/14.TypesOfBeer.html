          The word "beer" is often used as a generic noun used to
          describe a cold refreshing beverage. For example, "Hiya Mike,
          let's go for a beer." However, beer lovers around the world
          will heartily agree that there's nothing generic about beer.<br>
          <br>
          When it comes to types of beer, there are many, many options
          to choose from. It's impossible to say which type is best,
          because they all have very different characteristics. You'd be
          surprised at how a pilsner can differ from a porter, or how a
          stout stands out from a cider.<br>
          <br>
          The names given to different styles of beer generally reflect
          individual characteristics of the product, such as where it
          originated. Most beers, particularly those sold commercially,
          are processed using traditional methods.<br>
          <br>
          Different types of beer have unique qualities like appearance,
          taste, origin and aroma. There are several styles that make up
          the world' most common types of beer:<br>
          <br>
          Styles of beer have a lot to do with how they taste, what they
          look like, how they smell and of course where they are made.
          Some common choices include these:<br>
          <br>
          * Lager: Some of the most popular types of beer are lagers.
          These include American styles including basic lager, all-malt
          lager, light lager, double pilsner, malt liquor and
          low-alcohol or "light" beers. Popular international choices
          include Czech, European, Japanese and German lagers.<br>
          <br>
          * Ale: American amber, brown ale, porter, strong, sour and
          wild ales are also common American beers. Also falling under
          the category of "Ales" are Chile Beer, Pumpkin Ale, Belgian
          and French ales, English, German, Irish, Finnish, Scottish and
          Russian ales.<br>
          <br>
          * Cider: While not an official beer, cider is still enjoyed by
          many beer drinkers. Favorites include standard cider, New
          England cider and many specialty ciders.<br>
          <br>
          * Hybrids: combining different beer styles or ingredients
          create this "experimental" beer. Berbed, smoked, fruit and
          vegetable beer and spiced beer are all types of hybrids.<br>
          <br>
          * Mead: Mead is not a beer, rather a honey wine that has been
          adapted from centuries-old recipes. Melomel is a type of mead
          blended with fruit or vegetables. Braggot is concoction of
          beer and mead, while Metheglin is mead blended with spices.<br>
          <br>
          Variety is the spice of life. If you're a beer drinker, you're
          likely loyal to a tried and true brand. But remember that
          variety is the spice of life. There is a world of options
          available to you, so try something new next time you're ready
          to crack open a cold one.<br>
