          Before you really get oriented to what home brewing is all
          about, it's easy to think it is a process that is set in stone
          and there is only one right way to do it. And it is true that
          the brewing and fermenting process has some steps that must be
          followed with some discipline if you wish to enjoy a great
          home made beer. But one of the reasons that home brewing is
          such a passion to many people who enjoy this way of making
          beer is that there as so many varieties of recipes and styles
          of making.<br>
          <br>
          You can easily get a feel for what a huge variety there is in
          ways to brew beer and in recipes for ingredients when you
          visit your local beer supplies retailer, go to home brewing
          web sites or sit in at home brewing club meetings in town. And
          the great thing about the social side of the home brewing
          culture is that you will come home with a notebook full of
          ideas of things you can try on upcoming batches of beer. The
          odds are you will have months of ideas to try out and you may
          never run out of new approaches, blends and recipes to try to
          make your home made beer interesting and tasty for yourself,
          your family and your friends.<br>
          <br>
          For that first time home brewing recruit, one of the best ways
          to help him have the fun of making beer at home without so
          much investment and mess that will come in due time is to go
          with a home brewing kit or machine. Beer making machines
          literally take all of the thinking and planning and risk out
          of trying out home brewing to see if you want to make the
          investment in a full set up. The machine comes with a full set
          of ingredients for one batch of beer and the equipment is
          automated so the novice home brewer can make the beer and move
          it through the fermentation and aging process and know the fun
          of having real home made beer a few weeks later.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly kits simply the process of buying and using the
          equipment and ingredients to get started in home brewing.
          Unlike the beer making machine which is used once and
          discarded, the beer maker's kit gives you the basic equipment
          which will be the beginning of your collection of the tools of
          a beer maker to be used over and over many times. But the kit
          provides the ingredients and the instructions to make the
          process of learning to make your own beer easy and fun to
          learn.<br>
          <br>
          Even for seasoned home beer makers, there are variations on
          the home brewing method that will give you more flexibility
          and range of choices that will affect how unique your beer
          will be. But each may have a greater investment of work and
          effort to use effectively so it's worth getting familiar with
          them in advance so you know your investment of time and effort
          and what you might expect with a new brewing method.<br>
          <br>
          Probably the most common brewing method most amateur brewer's
          use and the one that is taught in most home brewing guides is
          the extract method. And even though it is well known, because
          you are truly brewing beer yourself as opposed to using a kit
          or a machine, you can alter the consistencies and flavors of
          your beer and get a wonderful brew each time you use this
          approach.<br>
          <br>
          You can settle on the extract method for a long time or
          perhaps use it exclusively for your brewing career and get
          great beers with it every time. But if you want a greater
          challenge and the possibility for even more unique beers as a
          result, you can explore the Mini-Mash method and the Full Mash
          Brew styles of home brewing. Each is more complex and takes
          longer to finish the brewing process. But they also give you a
          lot of flexibility and even more ability to make your own beer
          unique and distinctive.<br>
          <br>
          It's up to you where to start in your beer brewing hobby and
          the paths you take. You can explore new approaches through
          networking with other brewers. But you will never get bored
          brewing beer at home because the variety of methods and
          ingredients are virtually limitless.<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          One of the great reasons for learning to brew your own beer is
          to learn more about the various grains and ingredients that
          makes one beer better than another one. When you first start
          your hobby of home brewing, you no doubt got connected to a
          local club or association of home brewers. They can help you
          learn the lingo and how to tell what the best grains are to
          use in your beer. But before you go to the first meeting, it
          might speed things up if you knew the basics.<br>
          <br>
          The use of malts is at the heart of how grain contributes to a
          great beer. The difference between a light beer that doesnâ€™t
          have a heavy malt taste and one that virtually tastes like a
          loaf of bread all go back to what malts you pick and the
          process that is used during the malting and brewing of your
          beer. There are actually a big variety of different grains
          that people commonly use when brewing their own beer and you
          may have to take some time to brew up a few batches using
          different grains to see which ones capture what to you is the
          perfect beer taste that will make your home made beer unique.
          But understanding how malting works is a good first step.<br>
          <br>
          Now as a home brewing enthusiast, you will probably not
          actually take grain through the malting process yourself. But
          you should become familiar with how malting works and why
          there is so much variety to the outcome of the malting
          process. In that way you can use that knowledge when buying
          the malts for your beer so you can get a malt that will give
          you the flavor, color and intensity of beer that you are
          looking for.<br>
          <br>
          The malting process starts with the grain to be used. The most
          common grains are barley, wheat or rye but others can be used
          from time to time. The grain is used from the seed form and
          steeped and germinated which gets the active part of the
          malting and brewing process underway. Germination, which from
          your high school science class you know is what happens when a
          seed sprouts out to become a plants, releases the store energy
          of the seed that was put there to jump start the growth
          process. We are going to use that energy and convert it into
          malt mash that you can use to brew your beer.<br>
          <br>
          What happens during the germination process of those grains is
          that the stored energy in the seed is changed as it is
          released. When the starches in the seeds changes into sugars
          by the enzymes that are active part of the germination
          process, those sugars give us one of the core ingredients for
          great beer. It is at that exact moment that the germination
          process is suspended using kilns to dry the grains and all of
          that good sugar and enzymes that became active remain in the
          malt for use during the brewing process.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously this description of the basic malting process is
          simplified but for our purposes it gives you a background into
          what happens before you buy the malts you will use in your
          home made beer. But based on this description, you can go on
          to get a feel for the wide variety of malt types. The more you
          know about malt, the better informed you will be about what
          malts you wish to use when you brew your beer. And those
          decisions will have a big effect on the taste of your beer. So
          for great tasting beer, use great malts and knowing one malt
          from the next is the key to knowing which to use for the best
          home made beer possible from your home brewing efforts.<br>
