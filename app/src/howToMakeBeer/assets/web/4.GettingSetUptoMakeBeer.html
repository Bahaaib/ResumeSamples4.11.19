          The hobby of brewing your own beer at home is growing steadily
          as more people discover how much fun they can have making
          their beer at home and how great absolutely fresh beer can be.
          There may be no more gratifying moment for a home brewer than
          to serve your own fresh beer to your guests iced down in your
          favorite beer mugs and hear the rave that your beer is as good
          as the store bought beer they like best or maybe even better!<br>
          <br>
          Part of the reason for the huge popularity is that getting set
          up to make beer and finding good supplies and equipment is
          neither difficult nor overly expensive. You can find or create
          the equipment fairly easily or get it discounted from others
          who have retired from the brewing business. And right now
          there is probably a home brewing store in your town ready and
          able to provide you with the ingredients as well as
          instruction books and recipes for all kinds of wonderful
          tasting beers you can make right at home. And with the
          explosion of web sites, ebooks and articles out there on the
          internet about home brewing, all the help you could ask for is
          at your fingertips to help you get started.<br>
          <br>
          The reason different people get into home brewing vary. Some
          love the social aspect as you join a large local and
          international community of brewers. Another reason is that it
          is just great fun to assemble the equipment, learn the recipes
          and take a stab at making your own home grown batch of tasty
          beer. Even if you "botch" a batch of beer, its all in the
          spirit of learning and it just drives you on to learn from
          your mistakes to make even better beer next time.<br>
          <br>
          A third great reason is you have so much more control over
          your beer when you brew it yourself. Because you are not
          dealing with a beer that is mass produced and shipped from
          hundreds of miles away, you can control the taste, the
          consistency and even the level of alcohol to make your beer as
          strong or mild as you want it to be. And you can make changes
          with each batch with virtually endless variations on the
          recipes that are available to the home brewing community.<br>
          <br>
          The supplies you will need to get started are easy to find and
          not very expensive either. Probably the best way to get a feel
          for what the best equipment is and who are the suppliers to
          favor would come from becoming a regular at home brewing clubs
          and gatherings and making some friends there. If you make it
          well known that you are a "new recruit" and need some
          mentoring in how to get set up, you will be overwhelmed with
          offers for you to sit in on a brewing session or two to get a
          feel for the process. If you take advantage of their zeal to
          help you get started, you will be way ahead on the game when
          you go shopping for the stuff you need to get set up to make
          your own beer at home.<br>
          <br>
          The equipment you will need is pretty much only used for
          brewing beer so you will need to think of storage. The pot for
          boiling your initial wort and the equipment to handle the
          beer, filter it and ferment it are all made in sizes and at
          prices to encourage the home brewing markets. You can find
          them at retail prices at your home brewing retail outlet in
          town. You can use the internet and shop second hand shops to
          get better prices. But many like to patronize the home brewing
          store that helped them get their start just to make sure they
          stay in business to keep selling you great fresh ingredients.<br>
          <br>
          That same retail outlet will be a good source for the grains,
          yeasts and hops you need for the actual production of beer.
          Freshness is the key so communicate with the management of the
          store to learn of just how fresh those things are. As with the
          equipment, you can buy these things from the internet and that
          is fine. But get to know your supplier whoever you use and
          make sure you are confident you are getting the highest
          quality materials to make your home made beer. <br>
          <br>
          It will make a big difference.<br>
