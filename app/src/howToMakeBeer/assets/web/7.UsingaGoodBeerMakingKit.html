          Lots of time the urge to finally take the plunge into home
          brewing comes when you went to the brew pub and paid ten
          dollars for an imported beer of one that was brewed in their
          pub. And even if that beer is good, it's easy to start to
          suspect that you could do as well making beer and that your
          beer would be perfectly fresh and would cost a lot less than
          ten dollars a glass to enjoy this flavor all the time. When
          that thought crossed your mind, the home brewer in you is
          born.<br>
          <br>
          The community of beer lovers is very large as documented in
          the huge beer sales that stay consistent around the world.
          That is why it is almost a shame and a crime when beer is mass
          produced and bad beer is sold so widely. It’s a crime because
          it is so easy to make really good beer. If you have that
          desire to enjoy the finest of this ancient recipe and maybe
          crossing the line to want to BE a maker of great beer, you
          will find that getting started on this great hobby is far
          easier than you may have thought. And yes while you will have
          to learn a few things about the process of making beer, it
          will be more fun than any class you took in high school for
          sure because you are learning to make something you love and
          you get to drink your final exam!<br>
          <br>
          Unlike school though, once you get down the basic process of
          home brewing, the variety of "right answers" to how to make a
          great beer are diverse and fun to play with. You can try
          different grains, hops and yeast combinations. You can adjust
          when each ingredient is added and learn how to balance the
          bitter flavor with the hops flavor to give you a deep rich
          blend or a light beer and all using the same equipment and
          much the same ingredients. So with that enticement to the fun
          and endless variety you can find in a hobby of home brewing,
          it's just a matter of getting started.<br>
          <br>
          It's very easy to fall under the influence of "beer purists"
          who will advocate very expensive and complicated equipment and
          using exotic ingredients to make a beer of very high quality
          and taste. If you make it a practice to socialize at the home
          brewing retailer or at home brewing clubs or web sites, it's
          easy to pick up that side of the home brewing community that
          is very particular and advanced in the craft of home brewing.<br>
          <br>
          But it is important to remember that just starting out that
          you are not a home brewing purist yet! And its best not to try
          to be one because starting out, its best to let others help
          you get some very basic equipment so you can learn the craft
          of home brewing and develop your skills easily and without so
          much pressure. If you spend thousands on very elaborate and
          hard to operate equipment too soon, you will be frustrated and
          if the outcome is not just right, you will be disappointed. So
          cut yourself some slack and buy just the basics and just learn
          to make a very down to earth starter batch of beer. If it is
          drinkable at all after you step through the process a few
          times, you are doing great. And you have all the time in the
          world to learn your craft and grow until you can afford to be
          a "beer purist" and be fussy and particular too.<br>
          <br>
          So don’t be ashamed to buy a basic beer making kit at the beer
          retailer store or online to get you started. These kits come
          with all you need in equipment and supplies to step through
          making your first few batches of beer. It's important you give
          yourself the time to use these starter kits to learn your
          basic skills. Then once you have the basics, it will be great
          fun to buy different types of grains, hops and yeasts and
          experiment to refine your skills. That is a natural way to
          learn and away to become along time beer making enthusiasts
          and enjoy this wonderful hobby for many years to come.<br>
