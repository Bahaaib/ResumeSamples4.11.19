          Fermentation plays an important part of the process of how to
          make beer. This is when your wort becomes beer. One of the key
          factors of fermentation is the temperature. The home brewer
          must maintain a consistent temperature throughout the
          fermentation period. The right temperature depends on the type
          of beer brewed, as well as the strain of yeast used. Usually,
          the yeast will have the optimal temperature right on the
          package.<br>
          <br>
          Generally speaking, ales ferment between 60 and 70 degrees,
          while lagers should ferment between 50 and 60 degrees. If you
          ferment at too low a temperature, you can wind up with a stuck
          fermentation. This is a stopping of the fermentation process
          before it has completed. This makes the yeast go dormant, and
          it can even kill the yeast. If you try to bottle beer that
          hasn't completed fermentation, you can end up with bottle
          bombs. Even if you don't get bottle bombs, you will at least
          wind up with beer that doesn't taste too good.<br>
          <br>
          If you ferment at too high a temperature, esters will be
          produced which create off flavors. Esters are undesirable
          compounds created by the yeast, and will give your beer a
          banana flavor. High temperatures also can produce fusel
          alcohols, heavier alcohols that have harsh, solvent-like
          flavors. It is important that the proper temperature is
          maintained at a steady, consistent rate, and does not
          fluctuate constantly.<br>
          <br>
          A common mistake made by those learning how to make beer is
          pitching the yeast before the wort has cooled down enough. If
          the wort is too warm, more diacetyl will be produced early in
          fermentation than the yeast can reabsorb.<br>
          <br>
          There are many methods you can use to maintain proper
          temperature during fermentation. You can buy specialized
          equipment, you can build your own, or you can use items you
          have around the house. The surrounding climate and time of
          year both play big roles in temperature control. In colder
          weather, you will have to keep the beer warm, and in hotter
          months you will need to keep your beer cool. A closet or
          basement are great places to ferment your beer.<br>
          <br>
          You can buy a fridge or freezer for your fermenting if you
          like. If you are just starting to learn how to make beer, it
          isn't likely that you are ready to make that kind of
          investment just yet. But there are several cheap ways you can
          maintain your fermentation temperature, and some do it
          yourself type projects as well so that you don't have to make
          any major investments in specialized equipment.<br>
          <br>
          The easiest method is simply relying on the temperature inside
          your home. This may only work in certain climates or at
          certain times of the year, but it doesn't require you to do
          anything. A water bath is another easy solution. Simply place
          your carboy or bucket in a bathtub and fill with water. It is
          best that this tub is in a guest bathroom. Or, place the
          fermenter in a kiddie pool or rubber tub. If it is hot outside
          and the water doesn't cool it enough, you can add ice to the
          water. Many brewers freeze water in 2 liter plastic soda
          bottles and place them in the water. This is what is known as
          a "swamp cooler". An alternative to a swamp cooler is to wet a
          towel or t shirt and wrap it around your fermenter. You can
          also point a blowing fan towards the fermenter as well.<br>
          <br>
          At some point, you might decide to actually purchase a
          refrigerator or freezer especially for fermentation. But you
          don't have to buy a brand new one. Perhaps you or a friend has
          an old fridge or freezer around. You can also look for second
          hand fridges or freezers at local second hand stores, or see
          if the local home supply warehouse has slightly damaged ones
          on sale. You can also look online at sites like craigslist or
          ebay. You will need a separate temperature control device, but
          these are easy to find online or at the LHBS, and aren't that
          expensive. It is also possible that you might find a fridge or
          freezer that has already been converted by another home
          brewer.<br>
          <br>
          Getting something especially for fermentation doesn't have to
          be an expensive option. There are plenty of do it yourself
          projects, including the son of a fermenter chiller. There are
          many variations of this, but you basically make a separate
          storage place for your fermenting that you can control the
          temperature. Pretty much the same idea as the fridge or
          freezer, it is a box for fermenting. A great thing about this
          DIY option is there are so many ways to achieve the same end
          result. It just comes down to creativity and ability.<br>
          <br>
          I've even heard of someone that made a fermentation chiller
          out of cardboard they glued together and lined with fiberglass
          insulation. They used frozen 2 liter soda bottles, and this
          worked perfectly fine and cost them a total of $13. You can
          research more ways online at home brewing forums, and should
          be able to find a solution that suits your situation.<br>
          <br>
          There is one more important note about fermentation
          temperatures. The fermentation process itself will produce
          heat, so the beer inside the fermenter will likely be a few
          degrees warmer than the surrounding air. You can purchase
          thermometers with probes so that you can monitor the actual
          temperature of you fermenting beer.<br>
          <br>
          Many brewers notice an improvement in their beers when they
          have made the extra effort of maintaining a constant, steady
          temperature during fermentation. You don't have to buy any
          specialized equipment for maintaining fermentation
          temperatures when you are first learning how to make beer, but
          you should still make efforts to ferment at the proper
          temperature.<br>
          <br>
          There are several dirt cheap ways to help in that regard. In
          time, you may decide to go ahead and make the investment
          necessary to maintain proper temperature. You will improve
          your beer, and that just&nbsp; makes learning how to make beer
          that much more enjoyable.<br>
