          There are a lot of people who have taken the plunge to buy all
          the equipment and get started making their own beer from
          scratch at home. But the odds are that just as many people are
          curious about brewing beer at home but are pushed away by the
          challenge of buying all this stuff and figuring out how to do
          it and then the problem of the mess and the storage of
          equipment and beer in different phases of fermentation and
          completion.<br>
          <br>
          For many, what is needed is an easy way to give home brewing a
          shot without having to go to all the effort of buying a
          complete set up of equipment, all of the ingredients and the
          bottles and storage just to find out if you like it. What is
          not generally known is that there is such a fast track way to
          making beer at home. By buying a simple device called a beer
          making machine, you can easily make a batch of beer right in
          the home<br>
          <br>
          The good thing about a beer making machine is that it is
          basically a plug and go situation. This takes a lot of the
          intimidation out of buying many individual units of equipment
          and going through each step of brewing and fermentation by the
          seat of your pants. The brewing machine goes a long way to
          take the preparation over so you can do all the steps using
          the resources of the machine. When you buy the machine, it
          comes with the ingredients and instructions.<br>
          <br>
          The entire design of a beer making machine is based on the
          idea of reducing the mess and fuss of beer making for that
          first time home brewer who needs to have some of the joy of
          making their own brew but not as much of the work and the
          worry. You certainly don’t have to be a beer making guru to
          use these user friendly machines because the instructions are
          clear and written in an understandable way and the ingredients
          come measured and ready to go.<br>
          <br>
          But as with any ready made solution for discovering something
          as great as home brewing your own beer, there are pluses and
          minuses to breaking yourself in on a beer making machine.
          Probably one of the biggest pluses is that they are a one time
          use machine that you can use and throw away. This gets the
          problems of cleaning and sanitation out of the loop entirely.
          All of the ingredients are prepared and ready to add in
          premeasured amounts so the fuss and worry about going from
          completely raw materials is removed as well. It is just about
          as user friendly as you can make home brewing be.<br>
          <br>
          The down side of using a beer making machine to break into the
          craft of home brewing is that because it is completely set up
          when you buy it as a kit, you don’t get the change to play
          with the ingredients and enjoy the creativity and
          experimentation that is a big part of why beer making is so
          fun. You go through the steps and make one good batch of beer.
          But you don't have the chance to make it a great batch of beer
          because you cannot make changes to the ingredients as you go.<br>
          <br>
          Also a beer making machine is sold to make one and only one
          batch of beer and then you, in theory, are to throw it away.
          This may seem like a big waste and you might try to clean it
          up to use it again. But the real idea of the product is as a
          starter experience. It really isn't the kind of thing intended
          for you to buy a new kit every month and continue making that
          same kind of beer each time.<br>
          <br>
          But keep the perspective that it is not really designed to be
          your total and final solution for beer making. By breaking
          into home brewing with the beer making machine, you get some
          of the experience of making and fermenting your own beer and
          then bottling it to serve a few weeks later as a genuine
          product of your little at home brewery. And the fun of that
          may be a great way for you to start making beer and then grow
          into a hobby that may last a lifetime.<br>
