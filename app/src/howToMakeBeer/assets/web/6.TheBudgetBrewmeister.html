          For a beer lover, one of the most enjoyable hobbies you can
          pick up is to brew your own beer at home. Once you get set up
          with the equipment and basic supplies, itâ€™s a fairly
          affordable hobby and you will get a lot of entertainment out
          of going through the brewing and fermentation process. Then
          once you start bringing out your own home brewed beer, you get
          the sense of pride because this beer made entirely by you, not
          to mention the enjoyment of sucking down that hearty blend
          that you created yourself.<br>
          <br>
          One of the hold ups that may have kept you from getting into
          making your own beer may have the cost issue. If you have ever
          taken a tour of a brewery and you see the huge machines and
          storage tanks, it's hard to see how you can do that in your
          kitchen with just a few simple devices. But there is an entire
          home brewing subculture that has risen up based entirely on
          being able to make beer yourself at relatively low costs. Its
          legal, its fun and brewing beer can become a major hobby as
          well.<br>
          <br>
          All that said, it's true that the initial costs can be pretty
          intimidating. The cost of the pots, fermenters and other
          specialized equipment can run into several hundred dollars.
          It's risky to sink that kind of money into a new hobby before
          you even know if you will enjoy making beer, whether the beer
          you make will be drinkable or if you will stick with it. And
          during a time when we need most of what we earn just to get
          by, that is a risk that may be holding you back from getting
          into the hobby of home brewing.<br>
          <br>
          Of course one natural solution is to get your first exposure
          and training in making beer with someone else's equipment.
          Once you start poking around home brewing web sites and places
          where the equipment and supplies to make beer are sold in
          town, you can find out about clubs and societies that are full
          of people who have taken the plunge and are making beer all
          the time right at home like you want to do.<br>
          <br>
          These people not only love home brewing, they can become real
          evangelists for their hobby and with very little
          encouragement, you can enjoy some Saturdays in their shop or
          kitchen learning how to brew beer with someone that already
          knows how. This kind of experience is priceless because you
          learn what to look for in equipment and what is essential and
          what is optional. You can go through the brewing process and
          learn a lot about how to make actual beer that is drinkable
          and what pitfalls to avoid. Meanwhile, you may not have spent
          any more money than to buy your new friend lunch or to bring
          the pretzels for the tasting party when the beer is done.<br>
          <br>
          But then when you are ready to get started, your knowledge of
          what you really need will pay off big time. You still don't
          have to pay top dollar for the equipment to get up and
          running. Lots of people get started with making beer and for
          many reasons, their hobby stops suddenly. The outcome is that
          there is a pretty brisk used home brewing equipment market out
          there. You can find discounted equipment in new or like new
          condition out on eBay or Craigslist all the time. But don't
          overlook the local sources as those home brewer clubs and
          associations may have bulletin boards with listings of people
          who want to sell their equipment. Pawn shops in the area are
          another great resource.<br>
          <br>
          Another great way to save money is to go together with a
          friend and buy the equipment together and split the costs all
          the way down the line. This makes brewing beer more fun and
          social and each of you can have the equipment and supplies
          home at different times to get to know it and learn to make
          good beer separately so you can make great beer together. And
          who knows, you may get so good at it that you start selling
          your beer to local pubs. And when the big bucks come rolling
          in from that, your investment in learning to brew beer will
          really look good to you.<br>
