          In any big area of focus and specialization, there are those
          who go on to greatness in that passion and those who only go
          so far, lose interest or get discouraged and quit. We see that
          in sports, business and art to name just a few areas. So it
          makes sense that the hobby of making beer at home will be
          subject to the same laws. Many people get interested in how to
          make beer at home, buy the equipment and may go as far as to
          make a batch or two of beer. But then after a while they lose
          the persistence to getting really good at making beer and they
          give up.<br>
          <br>
          But in this very popular and growing field of home brewing,
          there are a few who go on to greatness as makers of fine beers
          at home. It's from this group that you commonly see the finest
          of home brewing being produced and the beers that consistently
          win prizes at home brewing contests that are held each year.
          And it is from this group that you most often see amateur beer
          makers make the leap over to begin selling their beer
          commercially and maybe go on to owning their own beer pub in
          town and realizing an entirely new career doing what they love
          to do, making beer all the time.<br>
          <br>
          Those that reach that level of success have the heart of a
          true Brewmeister and they exhibit all the traits of someone
          who is destined to create some wonderful and delicious beers.
          So what characteristics are in the personality of someone who
          can push on to that level of success brewing beer? It's
          helpful to think this through to see if perhaps you have the
          heart of a true Brewmeister as well.<br>
          <br>
          Someone who will succeed at brewing beer has a high attention
          to detail. At first, you have to learn the ropes of making
          beer by following the instructions that come with your beer
          kit or equipment and learn all you can about the step by step
          process of making a very basic batch of good tasting beer. The
          future Brewmeister wants to learn the basics and get them down
          very well so his foundation is strong once the time comes to
          innovate and use some brewing creativity to make some truly
          new and interesting blends.<br>
          <br>
          The Brewmeister also is a virtual fanatic about cleanliness
          and sanitation. Most often when you taste home made beer that
          is flawed, it comes from lack of attention to sanitizing the
          preparation equipment and maintaining an almost operating room
          level quality of sanitation throughout the brewing process. To
          the one who is a Brewmeister through and through, there is not
          such thing as "good enough" when it comes to how clean his
          beer brewing facilities are. Only perfectly sanitary is good
          enough.<br>
          <br>
          Another basic personality trait in a person who is devoted to
          making only the finest of quality beer is patience. This
          patience shows itself in a number of ways. It shows itself in
          the willingness to shop without tiring to get the finest
          ingredients for the next batch of beer he makes. It shows
          itself in the willingness to only buy enough materials for one
          batch and then go out and buy a completely new set of
          materials each time just to make sure his ingredients are
          perfectly fresh.<br>
          <br>
          Above all the true Brewmeister will wait as long as it takes
          for that beer to go through the weeks of fermentation and
          aging. And if he takes that beer out after a cycle is done and
          tastes it and it isn't up to his high standards, he can wait
          another month or two or more until it reaches a level of high
          quality that will be acceptable to anyone who drinks the beer
          he makes.<br>
          <br>
          Finally that one Brewmeister in a hundred who goes on to
          greatness in making the best beer imaginable from a home
          brewing setting is impossible to discourage. The idea of
          giving up because one batch of beer didnâ€™t come out right or
          something else introduced a set back to the effort is out of
          the question. It is that kind of persistence combined with
          patience, attention to detail and creativity that is the
          perfect personality blend that makes a great Brewmeister who
          will go on to greatness in this wonderful passion of home
          brewing.<br>
