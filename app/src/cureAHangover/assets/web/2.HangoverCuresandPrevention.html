          The nightlife in Singapore has been accused at times of having
          a life of its own. A post by Asia Club Reviews, "The Singapore
          nightlife is a beast all its own. It grabs a hold of you, and
          doesn't let go until you've satisfied your desires and emptied
          your wallet. One can't help but be lured in by it's promises
          of fun and fancy. The real scary thing is that it delivers."
          The same can be said about the drinks you buy throughout your
          evening. It's fun and fancy at the time, but in the morning,
          it's not fun at all.<br>
          <br>
          I'm sure you know what I'm speaking of. That's right. A
          hangover. A hangover that lasts much longer than the amount of
          time you were drinking. Sometimes the WHOLE next day. It has
          ruined my weekend before. It almost doesn't seem fair, does
          it? You think you're paying for tasty drinks, but what you're
          really paying for is a day after drinking of complete misery.
          For those of you who have not received a nice day after treat
          of a hangover, congratulations. You are doing something right.
          However, for the rest of us who are not so lucky, here are
          some great prevention tips to keep those pounding construction
          workers out of your head.<br>
          <br>
          Number one, eat. Eating is an easy tip. This might be a usual
          thing a lot of people do naturally before and during a night
          out. Many people I know would want to eat before they went out
          drinking to prevent getting too sick. They mistakenly think
          the food in their stomach is "soaking up" the alcohol. So they
          would just eat a half a loaf of bread and think they were good
          to go. However, what the food is actually doing is mix with,
          and help reduce the potency of the alcohol to your system.<br>
          <br>
          Remember, the reason you get "drunk" in the first place is
          because your body can't get rid of all the toxins in the
          alcohol. When the alcohol is in less concentration when mixed
          with food, your body can process it better. So the tip here
          is: Eat a light meal prior to going out for a night on the
          town. As you are in the mix of drinking and having fun, try
          nibbling on some snacks if they have any at the bar, pub or
          club. Things like peanuts or pretzels are there for a reason.
          Do not drink water while you are drinking though. This will
          help speed up the process of absorption of the alcohol and
          digestion and may make you more intoxicated.<br>
          <br>
          My friends and I made a little ritual out of going out for a
          dinner before we hit the bar, pub or club. Our favorite place
          was Hooter's, but I'm sure you have a favorite place you and
          your friends like to go. We would order our favorite meals,
          eat (don't over eat) and be merry. This way it made our
          nightlife a much more enjoyable experience and also the next
          day as well.<br>
          <br>
          Another highly regarded tip is to be hydrated. Many people
          hear this and many people think they are doing what they need
          to. But the reality of it is that a lot of people never even
          get their daily "dose" of water, let alone enough to keep them
          hydrated throughout the night and into the next day. An
          average person's daily consumption of water should be at least
          eight glasses of water. I consider myself someone who likes to
          try and stay healthy. For this to happen, I need to drink at
          least two litres of water daily. Now you might be saying
          there's no way you can drink that much. Well, you might be
          right. I am very active and I also have been doing it for a
          long time. I rarely drink anything else but water. Only on the
          nights that I go out is when I have something different.
          However, anyone can easily drink their suggested daily amount.<br>
          <br>
          The point I am making is this. You can't expect to drink a
          glass of water before you go drinking, and want to wake up
          with no hangover whatsoever. It's just not going to happen.
          The main key to waking up after a great nightlife is to be
          hydrated. The way to do that is to start drinking your water
          in the morning before. A lot of people have said, "Well I
          didn't know I was going out tonight until the last moment." My
          response has always been "You should start drinking more water
          everyday." The main factor of a hangover is de-hydration
          right? So being hydrated is going to be your biggest hangover
          fighting factor. When your nightlife is precluded with food
          and water, you can greatly prevent a hangover.<br>
          <br>
          Some tips on staying healthy while drinking:<br>
          <br>
          I would highly suggest not taking aspirin, Tylenol or any type
          of pain medication when you are out on the town. Although this
          might be a popular idea of hangover prevention, it is the
          wrong thing to do. Taking any aspirin Tylenol or ibuprofen
          will not help with your hangover the next day, and can
          actually cause you more damage to your liver than drinking
          alone. Taking pain killers are also very dangerous to take
          prior to your drinking escapades.<br>
          <br>
          Vitamins have been suggested as a hangover cure. Although I
          couldn't say yes or no to this (I'm thinking no) working as a
          hangover prevention technique, I believe that it can only do
          better for your body than harm. When you drink, you lose
          nutrients and other things your body needs to work
          efficiently. Regularly taking vitamins can help in your body's
          ability to filter out the toxins you intake while drinking.
          Remember, you and your tongue might enjoy that wonderfully
          mixed drink, but the rest of your body is treating it like the
          plague, and is doing everything in its power to remove the
          alcohol. So although they won't be the prime component in
          preventing your hangover, they could actually be playing a
          small role.<br>
          <br>
          The most important suggestion I can give you for staying
          healthy while drinking and preventing a hangover is this;
          Drink moderately. Your body works in a way which it CAN remove
          the alcohol from your body, but usually only at a rate of one
          drink per hour. People sometimes drink more than this, and
          some drink less. However, you can be assured that if you are
          drinking no more than one drink an hour (whether it's a mixed
          drink, a shot, a pint of beer, or a glass of wine) you will
          still be able to have a fun and exciting nightlife, while
          still doing the best for your body. More importantly, you will
          be doing your head a world of good the next day.<br>
          <br>
          So you might be asking "I didn't follow your tips, and now I'm
          paying the price. What should I do NOW?" Well, the best thing
          to do right now is drink a glass of water. Do you have some
          Tylenol, ibuprofen or aspirin? Take one. The day after you
          drink is a fairly safe time to have an aspirin or pain
          medication. However, you need to stay hydrated. You may be
          able to have a bit of food. But I would wait a little while
          until you get enough water back into your system. If this
          hangover is about to break out of your head, follow these
          steps to save your life (not really, but it will relieve you
          of those construction workers working over time in your head).<br>
          <br>
          Here are my step-by-step instruction on curing a hangover:<br>
          <br>
          1. Drink a glass of lightly chilled water right away. Water is
          easier for your body to take in if its only a little chilled.
          Your body has to work to cool down hot water or warm up cold
          water. Do not drink more than one at this point, no matter how
          thirsty you are. You will over-hydrate (you didn't know you
          could do that huh?) and your stomach will let you know that it
          didn't like that.<br>
          <br>
          2. After about ten minutes, have another half glass (no more)
          of water with your aspirin. This will ensure you have enough
          hydration to help digest your aspirin. Waiting for ten minutes
          will also ensure that your major organs are hydrated again to
          start processing a medication and ensure that it doesn't do
          more harm than good.<br>
          <br>
          3. When your stomach feels like it can handle it (usually no
          more than an hour but no less than 30 minutes), have another
          glass of chilled water. You will want to continue having an
          hourly glass of water for about three to four hours. You don't
          have to down a glass of water every hour. It's okay if you sip
          from the glass. Just make sure you finish the glass before the
          hour.<br>
          <br>
          4. If and when you can stomach it, I would suggest eating a
          healthy, well balanced light meal of protein, carbohydrates
          and fruits or vegetables. One of my greatest hangover cure
          meals was crackers and cheese with some sliced-up fruit.
          Delicious, light and easy on the stomach. I would stay far
          away from anything really heavy or greasy. Like burgers or
          fries, no matter how easy they are to get.<br>
          <br>
          If you follow those steps, I guarantee you will start to feel
          better almost right away. The aspirin will help. However, I
          encourage you to follow each step to its completeness. You
          will need to re-hydrate. So make sure you have all the glasses
          of water suggested in that time frame. And don't starve your
          body of it's nutrients. You will need to replenish those
          vitamins and minerals needed by, well, every part of your
          body. So when you can, eat something. At least, have a vitamin
          supplement to take care of those needs until you can actually
          eat something and keep it down.<br>
          <br>
          A nightlife can come with a price. If you don't want to pay
          that extra price, pay attention to these tips and suggestions.
          Your mind and body will thank you. You will be able to take
          back your weekend and enjoy more than just the nightlife.
          Although we all know that's where the exciting things happen.
          Just remember, drink responsibly.<br>
