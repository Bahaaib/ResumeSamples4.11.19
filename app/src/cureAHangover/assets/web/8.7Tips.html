          How about teaming up your favorite meal with the best of wine
          this weekend? It sounds a great idea but don’t you think you
          may overindulge? Well, you may not mind this but what about
          the hangover you have to face, the other morning. How about
          spending you entire Sunday afternoon sitting inside the
          bathroom, with one hand on your forehead and the other on your
          stomach? Scary isn’t it?<br>
          <br>
          Hey, hold on! I am not trying to scare the life out of you. I
          am just showing you the real picture of a hangover that you
          may require to face the following day after you have
          overindulged in your favorite wine.<br>
          <br>
          This sounds really bad but don’t worry, there are many tips
          you can follow in order to get rid of a wine hangover. All you
          need to do is to follow the instructions given below:<br>
          <br>
          a) Water, water and water:<br>
          <br>
          Water is the key to get over the wine hangover. Drink plenty
          of water. Alcohol has a tendency to dehydrate your body. This
          is the main reason that most people end up having a lot of
          liquids in the form of plain water, lemon water, coffee and
          black tea without having pee for a single time. If you want to
          stay away from the temptation of overindulging in wine, the
          best way is to have a glass of water for each glass of wine
          you desire to have. Wine is a great source of water, but the
          presence of water tends to produce adverse effects on the
          body. Hence, it is necessary to keep hydrating your body with
          water.<br>
          <br>
          b) Binge in:<br>
          <br>
          Sounds great! Believe me, it really works. Eat your favorite
          meal or some snacks an hour before a drink. This will save you
          from getting involved into overindulge and the hangover. The
          meal or snack should include bread or pasta.<br>
          <br>
          c) No prescription drugs:<br>
          <br>
          So you want to save money! It’s a good idea but you should not
          save money via mixing your glass of wine with prescription
          drugs for more effects. This will only damage your body. Drink
          less if you really want to save money.<br>
          <br>
          d) Milk:<br>
          <br>
          Drink a glass of milk prior to consuming wine. This will
          provide a protection coat to your stomach and helps you absorb
          the alcohol in the wine.<br>
          <br>
          e) No salt:<br>
          <br>
          Salt will prove dangerous as it tends to maximize the process
          of dehydration. You should stay away from salt when having
          margarita...<br>
          <br>
          f) An aspirin:<br>
          <br>
          An aspirin will help you to remove headache. Avoid taking
          ibuprofen or paracetamol. These medicines usually have adverse
          effects on the body especially after the consumption of wine.<br>
          <br>
          g) Avoid dark drinks:<br>
          <br>
          The major hangover you experience may be due to combining red
          wine with whiskey. You should mix whiskey with soda or water.
          Avoid mixing it with cola and tonic.<br>
          <br>
          Hangover is due to over indulgence in wine. Try to stay away
          from it. Follow the instructions mentioned above you would
          feel better after a wine party with your friends.<br>
