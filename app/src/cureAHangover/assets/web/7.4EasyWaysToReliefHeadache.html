          Having headache is annoying and sometimes it is difficult for
          us to avoid. Mostly when we are under pressure, headache
          appeared automatically. If it gets worse, we might faint due
          to the pain we felt.<br>
          <br>
          A headache is a condition of mild to severe pain in the head.
          It can also attack at our upper back or neck. There are
          different types of headache, but most of the time headache
          brought on by stress, too long in front of computer, noise and
          others.<br>
          <br>
          One of the main causes of headache is tension in the muscles
          of the neck, scalp and jaw. We usually deal with it by taking
          some sleep or consume over-the counter aspirin to release our
          pain. However, can we do this at any place?<br>
          <br>
          Obviously, we cannot sleep at the office or at the mall. In
          addition, we might run of aspirin when headache strike us.<br>
          <br>
          Do not worry! The easiest way to handle headache and we can do
          it everywhere is through massage. Massage is the practice of
          applying pressure or vibration to the soft tissues of the
          body, to heal injury, relieve psychological stress, manage
          pain, improve circulation and relieve tension.<br>
          <br>
          When we suffer from headache, we can help ourselves with
          self-massage. Simple and everybody can do it, either at work
          or home.<br>
          <br>
          Here are four easy ways in massage to heal our headache.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Eyes Area Massage -- Close your eyes.</b> Place your
          middle fingers to your eyes that are above cheekbones. Massage
          that area gently but firmly in circular motion for 1 minute,<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Eyes to Nose Massage</b> – Using thumb, go along the
          underside of eyebrows (along the bone on top of eye socket).
          Feel where this bone meets the bridge of your nose and eyes
          and find a point where there is a small indentation. Very
          gentle pressure, press your thumbs into the points. You can do
          it four times by holding and press that area for 10 seconds in
          each press.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Neck Massage</b> -- Massage a point where you can feel
          it by moving the middle fingers of your hands to the back of
          your head and feel the base of your skull. Specially, at the
          tops of your neck that meets the base of your skull. Massage
          for a minutes using finger tips gentle in circular movement.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Scalp Massage</b> – Let your palms of your hands massage
          your scalp on the top of your skull for a minute gently.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have done all those massages, start taking a deep
          breath. Lift your shoulders towards your ears for five to 10
          seconds to relief remaining pain, and then let them drop back
          down into their natural position.<br>
          <br>
          You are going to feel better when you can do that for a couple
          of times. Your massage will relief your headache and your head
          will feel less weighty.<br>
