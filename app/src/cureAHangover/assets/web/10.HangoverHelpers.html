              Surviving the Morning After</b></font></big></big><br>

          It's the morning after, and if that glass on your nightstand
          is half empty, you may be even worse off than you thought.<br>
          <br>
          While there are enough hangover remedies to make your head
          spin, most only address a small portion of the problem:
          dehydration.<br>
          <br>
          Hangovers are actually caused by a complex chain of chemical
          reactions that occur in the body after drinking alcohol, which
          results in not only the loss of fluids but also sodium and
          potassium. The effects of a hangover include nausea, weakness,
          dizziness and sleeplessness.<br>
          <br>
          If you have had one too many, here are a few of the most
          popular hangover remedies and how they can help:<br>
          <br>
          * Water: It's the first step toward combating dehydration.<br>
          <br>
          * Coffee: Coffee won't sober you up, but the caffeine will
          wake you up and help that headache. But it can also increase
          dehydration and make your stomach feel worse, so if you choose
          coffee as your cure, drink plenty of water.<br>
          <br>
          * Eggs: The protein in eggs helps provide energy. They also
          contain cysteine, a nutrient that is thought to help rid the
          body of toxins.<br>
          <br>
          * Energy drinks: Energy drinks can replenish lost nutrients
          and rehydrate your body. But one product, Hair of the Dog,
          goes beyond the typical energy drink because it also contains
          detoxifiers that target the liver. Hair of the Dog contains
          natural stimulants to get your metabolism going, 1,000
          milligrams of vitamin C, as well as B vitamins.<br>
          <br>
          * Gingerroot: Gingerroot tea can settle your upset stomach.<br>
          <br>
          * Hot soup: Soup soothes the stomach and helps with
          rehydration.<br>
          <br>
          * Bananas: Bananas are rich in magnesium and potassium, which
          are depleted during heavy drinking.<br>
          <br>
          * Honey: Honey will increase your blood sugar levels.<br>
          <br>
          * Tomato juice: Since tomato juice contains salt, it helps the
          body retain fluids. In fact, any fruit or vegetable juice will
          rehydrate your body and replenish it with vitamins and other
          nutrients.<br>
