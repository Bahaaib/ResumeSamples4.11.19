          Rather than treating your hangover with a cure the next day,
          you may have realised that the best way to avoid getting
          hungover is simply to prevent it rather than waiting until you
          the next day when the pain is already there.<br>
          <br>
          The unfortunate truth is that many of us forget to take a
          vitamin drink or to have the right amounts of water, fruit
          juice and food after drinking and before sleeping in order to
          prevent their hangovers.<br>
          <br>
          Why do we forget? Maybe something to do with a slight
          overindulgence the night before? Despite leaving the
          multivitamin effervescent pill with liver protection tint on
          the pillow so we don't forget to take it, the fact is that in
          our inebriated state, we do sometimes forget, contrary to all
          the great advice that people give us about how hangovers can
          be prevented by taking an effervescent multivitamin before
          sleeping and/or eating a starchy meal after drinking.<br>
          <br>
          We know it's much better and more effective to prevent
          hangovers rather than waiting until we are already hungover
          the next day. However, every single drinker can forget and
          wake up feeling like donkey dung, no matter how clever they
          are. Even Einstein probably forgot once.<br>
          <br>
          Treating a hangover isn't a simple matter and finding the
          right cure for your evil, poisonous condition can be a
          challenge as we all know.<br>
          <br>
          If you're aware of the different levels of hangover you can
          suffer from, you'll probably be looking to match your
          condition up with the correct remedy or cure. So for treating
          each type of hangover the morning after kindly greets you
          with, we have listed a number of remedies for you:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Hangover type 1. Next Day Buzz</b><br>
          <br>
          The next day buzz is hardly a real hangover. You'll maybe get
          away with drinking an espresso coffee and water. Yes coffee is
          not generally recommended for hangovers, but this time you can
          give it a go to wake you up as it won't dehydrate you too
          much, hopefully.<br>
          Pop a vitamin drink too and enjoy your lunch.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Hangover type 2. Gas Head</b><br>
          <br>
          Tired and unable to think too straight or concentrate for too
          long, you need a bit more of a pick up for treating your
          languid state.<br>
          <br>
          Drink lots of fruit juice throughout the day and have a
          multivitamin. Make sure the foods you eat are starch based
          like pasta and toast and maybe have a banana. Don't eat too
          much otherwise you may fall asleep.<br>
          <br>
          A sports drink can also hydrate you nicely and pick you up
          when you're feeling like this.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Hangover type 3. The Classic</b><br>
          <br>
          To remind you of how you feel:<br>
          You still feel a bit drunk the next morning and have a classic
          next day headache, dry mouth and your guts are moving around a
          bit. You cannot concentrate and are continually drinking
          water, although you don't need the toilet.<br>
          <br>
          Hmmm. The recommendation for treating this type of hangover
          is:<br>
          <br>
          - eggs and bacon<br>
          <br>
          - 2 bananas<br>
          <br>
          - lots of water and fruit juice throughout the day<br>
          <br>
          - an energy drink without caffeine (sports drink)<br>
          <br>
          Hangover type 4. The Beast<br>
          <br>
          Now we're talking. You really overloaded last night if you're
          suffering from The Beast today. A bee stung your brain, your
          breath is worse than Rover the dog who just ate a 2 week old
          steak he found in a bin in the street and you feel like you'll
          vomit if you even think about alcohol. You're never going to
          drink again, ever. Well, until Friday maybe.<br>
          A tough, delicate condition to overcome.<br>
          <br>
          To get back on track, you need:<br>
          <br>
          - fruit juices, banana juice and tomato juice tend to be very
          effective<br>
          <br>
          - sugar drinks, (like soda) to rehydrate &amp; increase your
          blood sugar level<br>
          <br>
          - when you can handle it, eat a banana with honey on it<br>
          <br>
          - big multivitamin pill (preferably effervescent)<br>
          <br>
          - have a hot shower or a bath to sweat out some alcohol, then
          blast cold water on your face and on your head<br>
          <br>
          - a brisk walk and some fresh air<br>
          <br>
          Try to resist having a painkiller unless your head is really
          still unbearably painful, even after drinking and eating all.
          If it's really hard, pop an ibuprofen, but not a tylenol as it
          can be tough on the liver after alcohol.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Hangover type 5. The Daddy of all Hangovers</b><br>
          <br>
          If your hangover is any worse than the beast, you must have
          the Daddy of all hangovers. We feel very sorry for you and we
          understand what you're going through. As far as a cure goes,
          you'll just have to stay put, drinking water or sugar drinks
          before you can stomach anything solid. Try to sleep through
          the pain.<br>
          <br>
          This is daddy of all hangovers personified, the very essence
          of the wicked witch of the pounding, shaking, cringing most
          terrible of aftershocks. You are a complete, gibbering,
          sweating, shivering mess and will be until next week unless
          you do something about it.<br>
          <br>
          Everyone's been there, even the most conservative of
          teetotallers who think having 2 beers in one night is being a
          bit crazy. Yes, that boy with the square glasses and the green
          cardigan from the library who acts like he's 45 when he's only
          21 has been there too. Probably.<br>
          <br>
          The window to your room is fast shut, the air is stuffy and
          you've sucked all the oxygen out. Through your slitty, half
          closed, puffy eyes, you vaguely remember starting off the
          night on red wine, even though you hardly ever drink it, and
          you have a fuzzy recollection of some club which you don't
          have a clue about, at some point in the night, somewhere.
          That's all. Except you have no idea how you got back into your
          bed whatsoever.<br>
          <br>
          Trouble avoided at least you think! Great, I'm safe, back and
          didn't have a fight, end up in a cell or wake up next to a
          cave troll! Bingo.<br>
          <br>
          Yet about this time, your body's simultaneously telling you
          something's up - some dark, evil, bubbling potion that passed
          by your lips is now starting to take its poisonous toll on
          your head and stomach. Right now as you open those puffy eyes.<br>
          <br>
          You start to wonder if a a bear came along while you were
          sleeping before you even open your eyes to painful shards of
          light at around 10am, after only 6 hours sleep.<br>
          <br>
          Not only that, the same bear has then proceeded to jump on
          your head in the night and boot you in the stomach a few times
          before stuffing its furry paw down your throat and leaving it
          there all night.<br>
          <br>
          The headache hits you like your head just got clapped between
          two ancient Roman gongs when you get up to go to the toilet!
          You think you're gonna blow chunks, you just make it, but
          stagger back to bed and try to get back to sleep to get
          through it. No way!<br>
          <br>
          Any attempt at drinking water or eating and you just vomit.
          This is one bad momma. Instead of getting better, an hour
          later you feel even worse!<br>
          <br>
          This time, it seems like only a flat drink of a sugar soda
          drink and a pain killer (preferably ibuprofen) can do to kill
          the evil head pains and make eating and drinking bearable.
          Then, just stay in bed and drink water and a vitamin detox and
          eat when you're ready to stomach it. It may take a few hours,
          that's all. <br>
          <br>
          Once you feel able to get up, have a hot bath or go for a walk
          and eat something, to help your body process the alcohol out
          faster.<br>
