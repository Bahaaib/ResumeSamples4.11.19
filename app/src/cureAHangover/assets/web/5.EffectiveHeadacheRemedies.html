          Headaches are usually caused by physical and emotional stress.
          If you are dying to find a solution to your persistent
          headache, try taking in over the counter remedies like
          aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen. But if you are not a
          big fan of prescribed or over the counter medications, try
          these home remedies for a change.<br>
          <br>
          - Try using compresses or cold packs. For tension
          headaches—the most common form of headache—try applying a warm
          or cold compress to your forehead and the base of your neck to
          numb the pain.<br>
          <br>
          - Try using heat. If cold compresses wouldn’t work out for
          you, try using a warm washcloth or a hot water bottle can ease
          pain.<br>
          <br>
          - Develop a routine of deep breathing exercises. If you suffer
          from headaches very often, try sitting in a darkened room,
          take in deep breaths using your nose, and let it pass through
          your mouth.<br>
          <br>
          - Experience the wonders of acupressure. By squeezing the web
          of skin between and the thumb through acupressure, it can
          reduce the pains and can help you relax.<br>
          <br>
          - Try relaxation techniques such as meditation, yoga, and
          biofeedback. By trying these relaxation techniques, the person
          who suffers from headache can feel the pain flowing out of the
          head. It can also help reduce stress.<br>
          <br>
          - Relieve the affected area by applying ointment with heat.
          Ben-Gay or Icy Hot rubbed on forehead or on the base of the
          neck, can give a soothing warm feeling to your head.<br>
          <br>
          - The power of music. Try listening to a relaxing music while
          lying down or resting.<br>
          <br>
          - Exercise regularly. Physical activities like regular
          exercise can relieve stress because it can loosen up the knots
          and balls of pain in your head.<br>
          <br>
          - Get enough sleep. Having six to eight hours of sleep can
          help you soothe your tired nerves. But, beware of sleeping
          more than 10 hours because it can cause major headache as
          well.<br>
          <br>
          - If possible, use a neck pillow in bed. If you are prone to
          experiencing morning headaches, try using a neck pillow to
          your neck while you sleep.<br>
          <br>
          - Totally eliminate caffeine, salt, MSG, and chocolate in your
          diet. Load up on lots of fruits, veggies, and water to keep
          your body well hydrated.<br>
          <br>
          - If you can, avoid bright light because it leads to a major
          headache once your squint.<br>
          <br>
          - Don’t skip meals. Skipping meals can lead to low blood
          sugar. When your sugar level goes down, your blood vessels in
          the brain tightens that leads to headache.<br>
          <br>
          - Don’t eat foods that have nitrates, sulfites, and msg
          because these are primary headache causers. Also avoid aged
          cheeses and nuts so you won’t experience headaches.<br>
          <br>
          - Don’t smoke and avoid smoke-filled rooms.<br>
          <br>
          Hopefully, your headache will get better very soon.<br>
