          If your life is plagued with frequent headaches, you might be
          getting tired of having to pop pills to try to take away the
          pain. You might be wishing for some natural ways to relieve a
          headache. Do such things exist? Can you get rid of your
          headache naturally? People all over the world for many years
          have been doing it and you can as well.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Hot/Cold Therapy</b><br>
          <br>
          It works differently for different people. For many, finding a
          nice hot pack and putting it on the area of the head or neck
          that is feeling the most pain. If you haven't found that to
          work, you may want to try cold. Something that you may also
          want to try is immersing your hands and wrists in either hot
          or cold water. This has been described by some people to
          almost draw the pain away from the head. Don't try to go from
          hot to cold very quickly, though, as this could end up making
          your headache worse. For this headache try hot. If it doesn't
          work, then try cold the next time.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Acupressure<br>
            <br>
          </b>Find pressure points on the inside of the eyebrows above
          the nose and press hard. Find pressure points on your temples
          and gently massage. There are several points throughout your
          body that massaging or applying pressure to can bring about
          relief of a headache. There are some on your hands, feet, arm
          right around the elbow, and at the base of the skull as well
          as others that can help. Many of these places can be accessed
          by yourself. Try to find these points and get some relief.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Aromatherapy</b><br>
          <br>
          This is something that you have to be careful of. Some
          headaches can be made worse by being exposed to certain
          scents. If you are going to try to use essential oils, try to
          get the purer and higher quality ones as these will help the
          most. Peppermint and eucalyptus oils work very well alone or
          in conjunction with each other. Some find sandalwood or
          lavender to help. You probably don't want to put these on your
          skin unless they are specifically designed to be put there,
          but you can find relief by putting it on a hot or cold wet rag
          and placing it near the pain.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Exercise</b><br>
          <br>
          Not only can frequent exercise cut down on the frequency of
          headaches, but doing a little light exercise while having a
          headache can help reduce some of the tension and release
          endorphins which are painkillers made by your body.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Eating Right</b><br>
          <br>
          While you should find a diet that will help you be healthier,
          making the right food choices can sometimes help you avoid a
          headache or shorten one. There are some foods that have been
          known to trigger headaches. Some headache triggers are
          alcohol, cheese, processed foods and certain preservatives.
          There are also those foods that can help alleviate the pain,
          such as spinach, cayenne pepper, ginger, and peppermint.<br>
          <br>
          Don't feel that you have to resort to taking headache medicine
          every time that you have a headache. Constantly putting in
          those chemicals can do serious damage to your body over time
          and can in some cases decrease your body's own ability to
          fight pain. Give your body a break and try to find natural
          ways to relieve a headache.<br>
