          What do you do now that you have finished that great
          manuscript? Many believe you can simply start sending it out
          to agents or publishers sometimes even both. However this is
          simply not true, just because you have created this riveting
          tale, you cannot send it out and expect it to be published
          right then. No, there are many aspects to being published and
          even more frauds out there, where the only goal is to con you
          out of your money. Filling their pockets and leaving yours
          empty and your dream of being published unfulfilled.<br>
          <br>
          So what to do, where to turn, who do you trust, who do you
          ask? Well the first thing is take that perfect manuscript and
          reread each and every word and prepare to rewrite, if you are
          like many authors out there who have a hard time seeing their
          own mistakes then join a critique group. These groups are
          designed to help writers, and many have guidelines to follow
          so that your critique is accurate and fair. Once you have
          joined the group, redone your mistakes, repeatedly, finally
          believing you have the best Manuscript possible, here comes
          the hard part. Getting someone else to believe it as well.<br>
          <br>
          You have to come up with a query letter that holds the readers
          attention using a strong hook. A hook if you don't know is
          that one scene, that one line, that grabs the readers
          attention making them want more, need more of what you have to
          say. Once you have that Query here comes the synopsis, a
          synopsis is summary of your story highlighting plot twist and
          turns along with giving, a detail setting your story takes
          place in, generally about two to three pages in length. A word
          of advice when you write your synopsis, know the ending even
          if not exact, at least how it will end. Publishers and Agents
          do not want to be still guessing at the end.<br>
          <br>
          Ok you have your Query, your Synopsis, your sample Chapters
          leading into the story, now what? Did you make sure everything
          is formatted properly; this makes a huge difference on
          acceptance to being read or thrown away before they look at
          the first line? So everything is properly formatted, you have
          researched the agents and publishers, you know who you are
          going to send out to, but there is one major problem who
          first?<br>
          <br>
          Well that depends on your list, first off if you want an agent
          then they are the first ones to contact. A good agent will
          walk you through the process from, professional editing to
          submitting to the publisher. Agents will have Publishers they
          want to send to first, but you can suggest your own as well. A
          good agent will not charge you; they make money off getting
          that contract with the publisher. A good agent will keep you
          informed at all changes, but most importantly, a good agent
          will be looking out for you.<br>
          <br>
          Now that we know what an Agent does maybe, you are like
          hundreds of other authors and do not want an agent. Well that
          is ok too; many go straight to the publisher. Whether you self
          publish or have a publisher, you need to follow the company's
          guidelines and rules. Also, remember that unless you are
          self-publishing then the Publisher pays you not the other way
          around. A publisher should also have a list of events and
          ideas they want to use to promote the book.<br>
          <br>
          No matter what way you choose to move that manuscript into a
          novel be sure to check out each publisher, editor, and agent
          on your list. Make sure they are legit, that they do not have
          any hidden fees, and any questions you have are answered
          completely before you sign that dotted line. Remember you are
          in charge, it is your work, and you have a responsibility to
          yourself, your readers, and your publisher or agent, just
          because the hard parts are done, do not stop. Send it out for
          reviews, ask local books stores to carry it, promote, promote,
          promote.<br>
