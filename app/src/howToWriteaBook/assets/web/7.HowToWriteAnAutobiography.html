    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">I lecture
            about writing to non-writers - hypnotists, numerologists,
            psychics, housewives, businessmen and women and people who
            often tell
            me that I should write about them because "they have had
            very
            interesting lives." I start my talks with a question. The
            first
            question I always ask is, "Who wants to write their
            autobiography?"
            About three-quarters of all audiences raise their hands. My
            next
            question is, "Can you tell me who will buy your
            autobiography?"
            Generally, most of the hands go down, the audience looks
            uncomfortable
            and shoulders begin to shrug. That second question is the
            first
            question you should ask when considering writing in the area
            of (auto)
            biography.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">People who
            get to write autobiographies, or have others write their
            biographies for them, are men and women who have done
            something really
            special in their lives. They were famous movie stars. They
            were
            national or international politicians. They were presidents
            and first
            ladies. They were incredible fashion designers. They built
            great dams
            and bridges. They were successful generals.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Even reaching
            a high status does not guarantee a biography. William
            Henry Harrison was only president for 31 days. He did
            nothing more as
            president than catch pneumonia at his inauguration and die.
            So even
            being president does not guarantee a biography. There are a
            kazillion
            generals in history but most of us can count the few we ever
            heard
            about without running out of digits. If you want to test
            that theory
            Google "Civil War Generals" and see how many there were and
            how many
            names you recognize. Even Custer probably would have been an
            'also
            served' had he not had a last stand.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The first
            rule of (auto) biography is, "An (auto) biography is not
            about a person, it is about what a person did." If Audrey
            Hepburn had
            been a housewife she would not have generated a biography no
            matter how
            gorgeous she was. It is possible that Katharine Hepburn
            would not have
            generated a biography without Spencer Tracy.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The second
            rule of biography addresses the question, "What did the
            subject of the biography do that would interest an
            identifiable market
            that is willing to spend money buying the book?" Books are
            easier to
            sell to identified markets than they are to general markets.
            Even if
            you have not done something huge in your life, if you have
            done
            something small that several thousand people could be
            expected to want
            to read about, you can probably get a book published - or
            sell a
            self-published book.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Occasionally
            someone related to a famous person will generate a
            biography for the famous person, which is really their
            autobiography
            that has a large market because of the fame of the parent -
            particularly if there is a twist to the fame. A case in
            point was
            Christina Crawford who wrote "Mommy Dearest." Her mother
            Joan Crawford
            was a horrendously abusive mother. In this case the answer
            to the
            question "who will buy your book?" is people interested in
            nasty gossip
            that will make a relatively famous movie star look really
            bad. Joan
            Crawford became less well known for her successful Hollywood
            career
            than she was for the harm she did to her daughter. It is
            quite probable
            that Joan Crawford would never have been the subject a
            biography
            without that abuse. It is an absolute given that Christina
            Crawford
            would not have merited a biography without the abuse by a
            relatively
            famous mother.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">For years I
            thought that books were about writing. They are not.
            They are about selling. 80% of your time as a writer is
            spent selling
            your book; selling your book to an agent, selling your book
            to a
            publisher, and then selling your book to an identified
            market. If you
            don't sell your book, you don't get to quit your day job. It
            is
            essential that you identify the people you think you can
            sell to and
            allow the interest of your market to inform your writing.
            Your book
            comes out of what you know that people like you need or want
            to know.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The easiest
            way to sell your autobiography is to identify a market
            that wants to read about what you have done, write
            specifically for
            that market and find organizations that are interested in
            that subject
            that you can use as a venue to sell books to their
            membership. For
            example, if your child survived a rare form of cancer you
            can write
            about what you did to help that child survive. Write about
            all the
            information that you learned during your child's battle
            against cancer
            that would be interesting and useful to other families
            facing a similar
            battle. The parents of children with cancer, and
            particularly that form
            of cancer, are your market. The organizations built around
            fighting
            cancer, and particularly that form of cancer, are your
            marketing venues
            - the people you talk to, the people you sell your book to.
            All the
            things that other parents should know about battling that
            disease, the
            way you felt and how you handled your feelings, any
            techniques that you
            used to help your child cope with chemo and needles and
            hospital stays,
            what you did to help your other children deal with feelings
            of jealousy
            and neglect, all that is grist for your mill. What you did,
            not who you
            are, is the stuff of (auto) biography.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You can also
            slide your (auto) biography into "How To" books as part
            of the introduction that establishes you as an expert in
            your field. 20
            or so pages, about what you learned and how you got to your
            level of
            expertise, that inform the reader about why they should read
            what you
            have written is your bio-introduction. These biographical
            chapters
            often encapsulate the highest and most exciting parts of
            your life
            which solves a problem about (auto) biography. Most of us
            live fairly
            boring lives with occasional spikes of excitement and
            activity. Most of
            us could write an article about the high points of our lives
            rather
            than a book. If you turn what you've learned into a "How To"
            book and
            talk more about what you can teach and less about yourself
            and your
            life, biography is easier to write.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Fictionalizing
            your biography is another way to write about
            yourself, interesting episodes in your life and what
            interests you. In
            fiction, I generally write in the area of medical thriller
            or medical
            rescue. I am a former New York City Paramedic which is a job
            that can
            be surprisingly tedious. It is a 'hurry up and wait'
            profession with a
            great deal of very dull transport in between a few extremely
            exciting
            rescues. In my books I slide in high points from the
            ambulance. I
            describe people that I found interesting, situations that
            fascinated
            me, amazing accidents and rescues that I participated in or
            heard about
            from other Paramedics, techniques that we used in the field,
            things
            that we studied that I imagined using in the field. It's not
            exactly an
            autobiography, but it pulls from my life, my interests and
            the lives of
            those around me. Turning what interests you into fiction
            increases the
            amount of material available to you.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Since you may
            be writing about a field of interest rather than about
            yourself, you may want to research what has already been
            written on the
            subject. Simply because there are other books in your area
            of expertise
            does not mean that you should not write in a given area.
            Think of how
            many cookbooks there are. What you want to do is read
            everything that
            has been written in your area of interest or expertise and
            figure out
            what is missing or how you would handle the issue
            differently. At the
            very least, you bring yourself and your personal experiences
            to the
            table. I wrote a small book called "Date Rape: It's Not Your
            Fault"
            which was inspired by my own rape. Are there other books
            about date
            rape? Of course there are. But those books did not include
            my story and
            how I handled my recovery and they did not reach the same
            market that I
            can reach.</font></big></big></p>
