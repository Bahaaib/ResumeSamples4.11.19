          Most people think writing a Book is just writing. I have lost
          count of the number of people who say “I want to write a
          novel” and think that they will just sit down, put pen to
          paper or fingers to keyboard, and the whole thing will just
          unfold before them. I’ve read a few novels, they think, why
          can’t I write one?<br>
          <br>
          If only it were that easy!<br>
          <br>
          The process of writing any story is exactly that, a process.
          And whether you are tackling a novel, a short story, an essay
          or a non-fiction book, you need to begin by planning your
          story.<br>
          <br>
          This is the most ignored stage in the writing process, and yet
          it is by far the most important. JK Rowling spent five years
          planning the Harry Potter novels. And that certainly paid off,
          didn’t it?<br>
          <br>
          The key to writing any story well, is to find the story that
          only you can write. This story carries your own emotional
          truth, and as you progress through the story writing process,
          your character will take you on the journey of emotional
          growth just as they will your readers once it’s published.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>The Deeper Character Journey</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          The deeper character journey is the most important aspect of
          any story. It is what your readers will remember and it is
          what makes the process of writing a story so worthwhile for
          the writer. Every time you take your character on a journey,
          you go on that journey yourself.<br>
          <br>
          So how do we find that deeper character journey? Where do we
          begin?<br>
          <br>
          We begin with this simple exercise:<br>
          <br>
          Without thinking too much about it, finish this sentence:<br>
          <br>
          • I am interested in writing a story where the main character
          discovers the importance of ………………<br>
          <br>
          Write for 5 minutes, preferably in long hand, allowing
          whatever comes up to just flow onto the page.<br>
          <br>
          When you have finished you will find that you have written a
          lot of different values into your answer. Values are universal
          qualities of human experience, either positive or negative.
          Take a few moments to divide these values into their positive
          and negative groups. You’ll find that a few similar ones in
          each group will stand out, so isolate these and then decide on
          the most important ones from each group.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have done this you can now write your deeper
          character journey in one simple sentence.<br>
          <br>
          • I am interested in writing a story about a character who
          goes from being….. to being…..<br>
          <br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">What is your character’s weakness?</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Every character has a weakness – something they need to learn
          to have a better life. Your character’s weakness should now be
          pretty clear to you, as it is strongly connected to what they
          need to learn the importance of from the above exercise. With
          your character’s weakness in place, you can now begin to put
          them and their weakness under pressure and suddenly your story
          is off and running.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Predicament</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Stephen King says he starts a story with a character in a
          predicament and watches them to see how they get out of it. So
          at the start of your story your main character must be in some
          sort of predicament or stuck in some way. The predicament your
          main character is in should be a symptom of their weakness.
          They are aware of their predicament, but they are not aware of
          their weakness.<br>
          <br>
          For example, a character who needs to learn the importance of
          patience, is stuck underground on a broken down train. He
          becomes more and more exasperated and angry as the minutes
          tick by as he needs to be at an important meeting. As he’s
          underground his mobile phone has no signal, and he also can’t
          just jump off the train, as the doors are electronically
          sealed, and besides he’s underground so he can’t just wander
          off up the tracks in the dark.<br>
          <br>
          So we know our character’s predicament will expose his
          weakness, which is impatience. The question for you to answer
          is, what does he do? How does he respond? What choice does he
          make? And he will make that choice based on his personal
          values.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Values in Conflict</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Conflict lies at the heart of all powerful stories. It is a
          well worn adage in story writing that nothing moves forward in
          a story except through conflict.<br>
          <br>
          But a good story also isn’t just a sequence of random
          conflicts, things that happen with no apparent pattern or
          meaning. It is a series of events, putting your character(s)
          under more and more pressure, forcing them to respond. This
          then shows us their true character.<br>
          <br>
          Values underlie our choices, our decisions, and in
          storytelling they drive the story through the characters being
          forced to make difficult decisions where their values are
          challenged. A value is a belief system based on what is
          important to the individual. A value represents something in
          your character’s life that they are willing to fight for. So
          if you have a married woman who is attracted to another man,
          her choice of whether to go with the other man or stay with
          her husband will be based on the values of romance versus
          fidelity or loyalty.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have nailed the values underlying your character’s
          choices, you will have connected strongly with your
          character’s deeper journey. This in turn connects you to your
          readers, who will recognise similar conflicts in their own
          lives.<br>
          <br>
          And you also have the essence of the story that only you can
          write.<br>
