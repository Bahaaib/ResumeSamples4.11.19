          sans-serif">The world of publishing is extremely difficult to
          get into. The writers that make a very good living, such as
          Stephen King or John Grisham are in the minority. It takes a
          best seller to enable you to give up the day job. I would like
          to write a book but I struggle to find the time. I guess I'll
          make time if I want it badly enough. More people than ever are
          buying books and it's very competitive. There are less
          independent publishers now and the big companies don't want to
          take too many risks on a new writer. They're not always smart
          about their choices either. J.K. Rowling was rejected several
          times.<br>
          <br>
          I read sometimes about people who have sold their debut novel
          and been given a huge advance to write another one. Just when
          I'm fuming with jealousy, I hear that they sold the film
          rights for squillions of dollars! The most annoying thing is
          when a celebrity is commissioned to write a book, only to hire
          an anonymous ghostwriter. Sports personalities seem to do that
          a lot. They take all the credit and most of the money. English
          soccer star David Beckham even won a literary award for his so
          called effort at an autobiography.<br>
          <br>
          The lucky writers are the ones that have a publisher really
          pushing them. A new writer needs tons of publicity after they
          write a book. Sometimes, the public is manipulated a little
          into buying a book. I have seen book covers with scantily clad
          ladies that I know has very little relevance to the plot.<br>
          <br>
          So what are the books that sell well? Non-fiction subjects
          such as cookery, travel, home improvement and gardening are
          always in demand. Unfortunately, I don't feel equipped to
          write a book on any of those themes. I could try my hand at
          fiction but that seems a harder market to crack. The crime and
          thriller genre does well but I don't think I could come up
          with a clever, intricate plot. I'm more into novels about the
          human condition, which explore relationships and modern
          society. For a publisher to go with something like that from
          an unknown writer, it would have to be very, very good.<br>
          <br>
          Sometimes, a great novel will come along that's critically
          acclaimed and a best seller. This just proves to me that the
          general public is underestimated and there is a demand for
          thoughtful stories. Publishers, like TV networks and film
          producers should stop dumbing down.<br>

          heart into the hands of your readers? Don't give up. There's
          an easy way to do anything and a more difficult way. The easy
          way usually includes getting helpful advice from someone
          that's been there and done that. The author has written five
          of those ten books that were stuck in her heart a few years
          ago. Here's eight steps that will speed you on your way to
          getting your book out now:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1. Setup a regular writing schedule.</b><br>
          <br>
          Think about your priorities right now. Can you fit 7-10 hours
          a week in? If you have to let something go that is not high on
          your priority list, do it. Now is your time. Later is not
          better. Set yourself up<br>
          for a successfully written book this year by committing to a
          regular schedule. After it's done, remember to reward
          yourself.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Plan a short book first.</b><br>
          <br>
          Many aspiring writers overwhelm themselves with goals of a 365
          page book first. Shorten your book to 25-90 pages the first
          time or divide your large book into a smaller book one and
          two. Though you shorten it, still fill it with useful
          information by using the question and answer format for each
          chapter. Using the same format and length for each chapter and
          answering all your readers' questions will not only speed your
          writing process but it will result in a successful book.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>3. Let your passion lead you to a topic.</b><br>
          <br>
          Passion will not only stir your readers when your book is done
          but it will keep you motivated to do the work involved. Yes, I
          did say work. Passion will make your work easy. Passion will
          lead you to develop all the profit centers (seminars,
          articles, or consulting services) your message deserves.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Choose what's interesting to you.</b><br>
          <br>
          If you are interested in what you are writing about you will
          happily write all you know and research to know more about
          your subject. You will easily spice your writing with
          interesting tid-bits that will delight your readers and keep
          them reading until the end of your book.<br>
          <br>
          Get your book out of your heart to paper fast. If you wait you
          could be this time next year with the same desire to get your
          book out. Use the eight easy steps of committing to a regular
          writing schedule, planning a short book first, choosing a
          passion-led topic, picking an interesting to-you subject,
          getting to know your reader first, developing a plan for each
          chapter, designing your book's top market spots, and choosing
          your non-fiction topic first to become a successful author
          sooner. The world is waiting for your important message to
          answer their questions and help them become successful.<br>
