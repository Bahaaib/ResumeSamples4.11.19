          Writing and walking are a seemingly odd mix of topics for an
          article,
          but they go well together. Particularly if you write during
          breaks in
          your walk.<br>

          Whether you are writing articles or the great American novel,
          you will
          inevitably suffer from writer’s block. A good way to defeat
          the
          block is to go for a walk or hike in a park or open local
          area. Walking
          gives you a chance to think through things, let your mind
          wander and
          clear out the riff raff.<br>
          <br>
          As you walk, your subconscious will be working and kicking out
          ideas to
          get you going again. You don’t want to lose these ideas, which
          can be a problem when you are a few miles from home and your
          computer.
          Frankly, nothing is more frustrating than getting an idea and
          then
          losing the thread while you hustle home.<br>
          <br>
          I primarily write information articles for web sites. Unlike a
          novel,
          the pure volume of articles is problematic. Coming up with
          hundreds of
          unique topics can be maddening, particularly if the subject
          matter is
          rather dry. Just imagine trying to write 100 articles on tax
          issues!
          One tends to end up staring at the wall for hours on end.<br>
          <br>
          I come up with my best ideas while walking on the beach here
          in San
          Diego, California. While the beach and tax articles might seem
          an odd
          mix, the ghosts of IRS agents apparently congregate on the
          beach and
          ideas become plentiful. I’ve tried two methods of keeping
          track
          of ideas while walking.<br>
          <br>
          I first tried taking a dictation machine with me, but it
          didn’t
          really work out. You would be surprised how loud the ocean is
          on the
          recording. I also found it difficult to pick up the thread
          again when I
          sat down to listen to my ramblings. Fortunately, writing
          journals
          turned out to be a better option.<br>
          <br>
          An author friend of mine that publishes novels suggested
          taking a
          writing journal with me on the beach strolls. He apparently
          had great
          success working out plot twists for his novels while hiking
          around
          Palomar Mountain, a good hiking spot to the east of San Diego.
          I gave
          it a try and the rest is history.<br>
          <br>
          I prefer writing journals to dictating for a few reasons.
          Initially, it
          is easier to just sit down wherever you are and write out an
          idea and
          story lines. I also find it easier to pick up the thread when
          I plop
          down in front of my computer to actually start writing.<br>
          <br>
          Writer’s block is a problem for every writer, regardless of
          the
          type of writing. If you’re having problems with it, you might
          try
          going on a walk and taking a writing journal with you.<br>
