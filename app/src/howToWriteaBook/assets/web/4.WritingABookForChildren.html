          Writing and Publishing a Children's Book is a dream for many
          people.
          Unfortunately, it is often a difficult dream to realize since
          most
          talented writers do not know or understand which steps to take
          first to
          begin the process of becoming known and getting published.<br>
          <br>
          Do you need an agent, illustrator, assistant, consultant or
          book
          marketer? Do you know which Children's Publishing Houses
          should be the
          first ones to submit your work to for maximum profit &amp; the
          highest
          probability of acceptance? Have you decided on type of
          Children’s
          Book you plan on writing?<br>
          <br>
          The Children's Book Publishing business can be complicated for
          the
          ill-informed, but easy to navigate for those that understand
          it. For
          those that are knowledgeable, writing &amp; actually
          introducing your
          work to the marketplace is clockwork.<br>
          <br>
          You may have the next popular children's book, but the fact
          is, if you
          don't know how to introduce it to the marketplace, you'll just
          keep
          running into walls which is what most struggling children's
          writers go
          through and sadly, never emerge from the initial phase of the
          publishing process.<br>
          <br>
          Consultants can be expensive, and seasoned &amp; well known
          Children's
          Book Publishers will rarely reveal their industry inside
          secrets to
          children's book publishers. After all, why would they want to
          put
          themselves at literary risk, and in a position to lose their
          book
          popularity &amp; income. Finding an honest individual to
          explain how
          the industry works as a whole will pose to be a daunting task.<br>
          <br>
          Yes, you will find hundreds of publications as to how to go
          about
          writing, promoting &amp; publishing a children's book, but
          most do not
          make it easy for the reader to understand the publishing
          process. The
          truth is if you follow most of the Children's Book Publishing
          tutorials, you will learn that they are inefficient, and could
          possibly
          cost you tremendous amounts of time.<br>
          <br>
          At WriteAChildrensBookAZ.com we offer a tutorial that takes
          you
          step-by-step in an A-Z, 123 easy-to-follow format that doesn't
          use
          complicated industry terminology. Instead, our site offers a

          Children's Book without the headaches.<br>
          <br>
          An auto-pilot formula that not other Children's Book
          Publishing guide
          can match. No writer wants to sift through hundreds of pages
          of
          Children's Book Publishing techniques &amp; ideas. To be
          successful in
          this business, you need to get to the point, and make it
          happen.<br>

          Whether you are looking to write, sell, promote and/or publish
          your
          Childrens Book, regardless if it's a picture book or regular
          book, you
          will not find a more effective formula than ours.<br>
          <br>
          There are hundreds of thousands of writer's that go unnoticed
          every
          year, with priceless Children's Book's eventually shelved or
          never sold
          to a publishing house because of a lack of knowledge in the
          business.
          Don't let this be you!<br>

          and
          personality traits, create a problem or a conflict, and learn
          how to
          set the state for a climax. Character development, plots,
          conflict, and
          resolution, to marketing &amp; publishing, you will everything
          you need
