          If you want to write a novel, but are putting it off until the
          kids are
          grown, I have two words for you: Don't wait. It's possible to
          raise a
          happy, healthy family and still follow your writing dream. And
          that's
          true whether you're single or married. Whether you're a
          stay-at-home
          mom or work outside the house.<br>
          <br>
          You may think I'm crazy - how can you find time to write when
          you're
          already so busy you barely have time to sleep?<br>
          <br>
          It can be done.<br>
          <br>
          J.K. Rowling quite famously penned the first of her Harry
          Potter series
          in a coffee shop with her baby napping in a buggy. I wrote my
          first
          novel in two years by setting my alarm for 5 a.m. every
          day and squeezing in writing before work, and then stealing
          any other
          time I could. I'd write a scene while my son built a Lego
          castle, or do
          some editing while he was planted in front of the TV for a
          half hour.<br>
          <br>
          A mother of two small children, Allison Pearson turned her
          frustrations
          as a mom into the best-selling novel, I Don't Know How She
          Does It.
          She's admitted that being a mom and trying to write a novel is
          difficult - "like having a secret third child in the house
          that you
          have to go and play with when the other two have gone to bed,"
          she's
          said. Still, she managed to finish in a year, even with
          holding a job
          part of the time.<br>
          <br>
          The most important thing to keep in mind is that you don't
          have to
          sweep aside everything in order to write. There's this
          assumption that
          writing a novel means countless hours of uninterrupted
          time-just you
          alone in a cabin somewhere with nothing but pen and paper and
          maybe a
          plate of Oreos. That's not only impossible for most people,
          it's not
          even preferable. Some of your best writing inspiration will
          come from
          life. If you make writing a part of your day-to-day routine,
          you're far
          more likely to stick with it.<br>
          <br>
          Some tips for combining motherhood with a writing career:<br>
          <br>
          1. Schedule it in. A friend of mine has a regular 8 - 9 p.m.
          date with
          her computer. Barring a broken leg or the house burning down,
          she never
          misses it, and she rarely goes over. Knowing she has a limited
          time
          spurs her to be productive.<br>
          <br>
          2. Lower your standards, at least when it comes to housework.
          Could the
          floor go one more day without sweeping? Could you use bottled
          pasta
          sauce instead of making it from scratch? Yes, June Cleaver
          always did
          everything perfectly, but she didn't write a novel. She also
          wasn't
          real.<br>
          <br>
          3. Involve your kids. Plunk them down next to you with crayons
          and
          paper while you write. Dub it your "creative time."<br>
          <br>
          4. Be the tortoise. Forget every story you've ever heard about
          how this
          or that author wrote a book in a month. Writing your novel
          will take as
          long as it needs to take. If you stick with it, you'll
          eventually get
          to the end.<br>
          <br>
          5. Delegate. Women often get stuck with the housework because
          they feel
          they're the only ones who can do it "right." Give jobs away to
          your
          husband or kids, and resist the urge to re-do them - even if
          the towels
          aren't folded right or the stove doesn't gleam the way it
          should.<br>
          <br>
          6. Consider starting small. If writing a novel seems
          overwhelming,
          start with a short story or even some of the super-short
          "flash
          fiction" that's popular right now. The bonus: It's easier to
          get short
          pieces published on the Internet, so you can amass clips.<br>
          <br>
          7. Banish guilt. As women, it's hard for us to take time for
          ourselves.
          If you're feeling guilty about spending time writing, remember
          the
          saying, "kids learn what they see." What your children will
          see is you
          plugging away at making one of your dreams come true. Isn't
          that at
          least as important as a perfectly clean house?<br>
