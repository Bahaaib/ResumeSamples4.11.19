          The publishing company is the backbone of the writing world.
          The
          publishing company provides a great service to society by
          publishing
          and displaying the work of authors. The global existence of
          publishers
          is obvious, but the inner workings of a publishing company is
          unknown
          by many authors. Many book publishers consider the publishing
          industry
          as an apprenticeship industry -- most book publishing
          professionals
          gain knowledge and skills in this field with hands-on job
          experience.
          Generally, what an apprentice learns in one department is
          useful
          throughout the publishing house, which gives professionals the
          opportunity to move between departments. A typical publishing
          company
          has many levels to it, each with different functions.<br>

          <br>
          The Administrative Department is the first level of any book
          publishing
          company. It has many responsibilities to help the publishing
          company
          function properly. The Administrative Department manages daily
          operations for publishing executives and management. This
          responsibility involves interaction with all employees from
          all
          departments, as well as interaction with authors and agents.
          The
          administrative employees manage the calendar, maintain
          organized files,
          screen/prioritize mail, draft correspondence, make travel
          arrangements
          and prepare itineraries, process expense reports, take minutes
          at
          meetings, and prepare reports. A position as an administrative
          employee
          allows a person to have a high-level of understanding of a
          publishing
          company, while being visible to executives.<br>

          <br>
          All large and small publishing companies have an Advertising
          Department. Most publishing companies have in-house
          advertising
          agencies that purchase media space and create and design
          advertisements. In a publishing company, the Advertising
          Department
          works closely with the marketing directors, editors, and
          publishers of
          titles to create an advertising plan that promotes sales of an
          author's
          book. An advertising plan requires research and negotiation to
          provide
          the best venues and the most cost-effective methods of
          advertisement.
          These employees also work closely with graphic designers,
          commercial
          sales representatives, printing presses, and internal staff to
          facilitate the run of advertisements.<br>

          The Editorial Department of a publishing company is one of the
          most
          important departments. The Editorial Department acquires,
          negotiates,
          develops, and edits book projects for publication. The daily
          activities
          of editorial employees include preparing acquisitions for
          transmittal
          to the production department; developing and maintaining
          relationships
          with authors, booksellers, and agents; performing general
          administrative duties; participating in editorial, design and
          marketing
          meetings; and reading and evaluating submissions by writing
          reader's
          reports. The editorial department must work closely with all
          departments.<br>

          Another division of a publishing company is the Marketing
          Department.
          The Marketing Department creates, prepares, and establishes
          marketing
          strategies and policies for each book title by coordinating
          the efforts
          of publicity, promotion, advertising, and sales departments.
          The
          Marketing Department prepares all sales presentation
          materials, audio
          recordings, fact sheet collation, and promotions; creates and
          produces
          additional account-specific presentation materials; researches
          and

          The Publisher's Office is also an important department for
          many
          publishing companies. The publishers oversee the life cycle of
          a book
          title from acquisition to production, and onto the sales
          force.
          Publishers make executive decisions for all book titles within
          assigned
          imprints while staying within any cost restraints. This
          department is
          also responsible for sponsoring book projects, strategies, and

          The Subsidiary Rights and Permissions Department is one of the
          most
          important divisions of a book publishing company. This
          department finds
          additional sources of profit for a given title, including
          serials, book
          clubs, and paperback, audio and e-book rights.<br>

          The road to getting a book published is a long one, but well
          worth the
          effort. Trust yourself, and trust the publisher to create a
          beautiful
          masterpiece. Don’t be discouraged if several publishers are
          not
          interested in your book. You may have to self-publish your
          first book,
          and then again, a large or small publishing company may accept
          your
          book based on marketability. Good luck and enjoy the process.<br>

          It is difficult to break into the publishing industry as a new
          author,
          and even more difficult to get an acceptance letter from an
          editor at a
          large publishing house. As an author you will work hard to
          finish your
          book, and work even harder to find the right book publisher.
          The good
          news is you can tap into several types of publishers to
          publish your
          book. Here is a look at some common types of book publishing.<br>
          <br>
          GROUP PUBLISHING: Group publishing is the process by which a
          large
          company publishes your work in the name of a larger company.
          For
          example, large publishing companies often operate smaller
          publishing
          companies. The larger publishing company serves as an umbrella
          over the
          smaller group publishing companies. Sometimes these companies
          operate
          several smaller companies and book imprints that produce
          different
          genres of writing and books. Sometimes this is referred to
          trade
          publishing. For example, a large publishing group may produce
          best-selling adult novels, but may also operate under a
          smaller name to
          produce certain non-fiction books, cookbooks, children's
          books, or
          niche titles. Group publishing is a popular way to publish a
          book.<br>
          <br>
          EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING: Educational publishing shares some
          likeness to
          trade publishing. These companies deal specifically with
          educational
          material. They may deal with only college textbooks, or they
          might deal
          with textbooks and materials for grades K-12. Besides
          textbooks, these
          companies might also produce other forms of educational
          material, which
          include posters, workbooks, CD-ROMS, software, testing
          material and
          maps. There are several big name educational publishing
          companies.<br>
          <br>
          UNIVERSITY PUBLISHING: Better known as the "University Press,"
          this
          type of publishing is different from group publishing and it
          is not the
          same as scholarly publishing. These types of companies are
          usually
          non-profit. Universities, colleges and sometimes museums or
          other
          organizations operate these publishing imprints. These
          publishers
          usually publish books by scholars and other specialists.
          Besides
          distributing their books to bookstores, they also make their
          book
          titles available within the university system. Sometimes
          larger trade
          publishers publish these types of books.<br>
          <br>
          INDEPENDENT PUBLISHING: Independent publishers are often the
          best way
          to publish your book with established distribution channels.
          Independent publishers are generally small, privately-owned
          companies.
          Many times, these companies only publish a handful of books
          each year
          and they specialize in certain subjects. They have the freedom
          to
          publish just about anything they wish.<br>
          <br>
          SOFTWARE and other MEDIA: You might consider software and
          other types
          of media as a publishing option. Think about the many e-books,
          CD-ROMs
          and digital downloads, many published by large and small
          publishing
          companies. These types of publishing companies are often
          associated
          with larger trade publishers. In fact, many large publishing
          companies
          have their own in-house media publisher to spawn the
          traditional
          paperback book into other types of media. Digital and
          alternate media
          is a huge, profitable business, and these publishers are just
          as
          important and lucrative as the large trade publishers.<br>
          <br>
          As you can see, you can tap into various publishers who might
          consider
          publishing your book. If you are unlucky with a large trade
          publisher
          or group publisher, then don't give up. Keep looking at the
          different
          types of publishing companies until you find one that wants to
          work
          with you and your book.<br>
