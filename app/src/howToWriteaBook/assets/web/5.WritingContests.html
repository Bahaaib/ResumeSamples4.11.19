<span style="font-weight: bold;">Writing Contests: Building Writing
Credentials</span><br>
<br>
One of the ways many writers can successfully add credentials to their
portfolio if to participate in a variety of literary contests. This
type of contest encourages writers to put their best foot forward in
both creativity and attention to detail.<br>
<br>
It is true that there are some contests that provide a cash award for
their top finishers, but there are also publishing scams that will
accept your work regardless of quality. When you receive notice that
your work has been accepted for publication it can be a real boost,
however, a quick look at many writer&rsquo;s websites can help you
define the contests that are essentially vanity publishers willing to
print just about anything if they believe you will purchase copies of
the book for friends and family.<br>
<br>
Many cash award writing contests cover the cost of prize awards by
charging an entry fee. This factor often discourages many writers who
may not feel confident enough in their writing to pay a fee to submit.
This allows those who do enter a better chance at placing.<br>
<br>
There are also writing contests that present the opportunity to have
their work published online, in a magazine or in an anthology. As a
rule this type of contest does not require a purchase of the
publication the work will appear in nor will they assume full rights of
your work. The best writing contests only require a one time
non-exclusive print right. This is important because it allows you the
opportunity to sell or place the work in other venues.<br>
<br>
Beware of forfeiting full (exclusive) rights in any writing contest.
When this right is given the ownership of the work is no longer yours.
You will have no right to use the material in any form without
permission from the publisher. It is possible to pay to enter a
contest, forfeit the rights to your work and allow a publisher to gain
long-term financial benefit from your work.<br>
<br>
Quality writing contests have the bonus feature of allowing you to fine
tune your skills by reading the work of others. Reading can make a good
writer even better. If you pay attention you can learn what works and
what doesn&rsquo;t while using writing contests as a means of gaining
valuable insight into unique styles and structure.<br>
<br>
On a positive note, there have been numerous incidents in which
individuals who entered a submission for a writing contest were able to
use that same work for publishing in other book anthologies and
magazines. The key is making sure to participate in writing contests
that preserve your right to control the reuse of the piece.<br>
