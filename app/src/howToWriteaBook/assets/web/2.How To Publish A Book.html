          Are you a writer who has only written web content or a writer
          who has
          only written as a hobby?&nbsp; If you are, you may still have
          the dream
          of writing your own book, a book that will get
          published.&nbsp;
          Although most individuals who research publishing a book have
          already
          written a book, you may have yet to accomplish this important
          task.&nbsp; The good news, however, is that it may work in
          your favor.<br>
          <br>
          If you have yet to write a book, there are a number of
          important steps
          that you will first want to take.&nbsp; These steps, a few of
          which are
          highlighted below, may help to improve your chances of you
          writing a
          book that will get published.<br>
          <br>
          One of the first things that you will want to do, when looking
          to write
          a book that will get published, is to choose a genre.&nbsp;
          This
          involves first deciding who you want to write for.&nbsp; Do
          you want to
          write for children, young adults, or adults?&nbsp; Next,
          decide what
          you want to write about.&nbsp; Do you want to educate your
          readers or
          give them a captivating story that they just can’t put
          down?&nbsp; As for the topic or storyline that you choose, be
          sure to
          choose something that interests you.&nbsp; A writer who is
          passionate
          about what they write is more likely to see success.<br>
          <br>
          Once you have an idea of what type of book you want to write,
          as well
          as an idea on your theme, take the time to examine publishing
          companies.&nbsp; This is easy to do with the Writer’s Market
          books and other similar printed resources.&nbsp; Most clearly
          outline
          what types of books publishers are looking for.&nbsp; For
          example, a
          publisher that is accepting manuscripts for science fiction
          novels may
          give you specific tips and ideas, as well as things to avoid.<br>
          <br>
          Writing a book with a theme that interest you, as well as a
          theme that
          is in demand by publishers is one of the best ways to get your
          book
          published.<br>
          <br>
          As for writing your book, it is important to start out with a
          plot.&nbsp; If you are writing a non-fiction book, such as a
          how-to
          guide, be sure to create an outline for you to follow.&nbsp;
          Fiction
          authors, however, should first outline a plot.&nbsp;
          Unfortunately,
          many authors, especially new writers, just start
          writing.&nbsp; Of
          course, it is important to get your thoughts on paper or on
          your
          computer, but a clear and solid plot is an important component
          of
          writing a book that will get published.&nbsp; Books that are
          just a
          collection of words are likely to not get published.<br>
          <br>
          Once your book has been written, it is important that you do
          the proper
          amount of proofreading and editing.&nbsp; Many professionals
          vary on
          the number of times that a book should be proofread, but you
          should
          read through yours no less than three times.&nbsp; In addition
          to doing
          your own editing, you may benefit from the professional
          knowledge and
          expertise of an editor.&nbsp; Many have reasonable fees.<br>
          <br>
          As previously recommended, it is a wise idea to first see what
          many
          publishers are looking for. Also, as previously stated, you
          can do this
          by using the internet or printed resource guides, like the
          Writer’s Market.&nbsp; If you highlighted or recorded the
          information that you read, you may already have a list of
          publishers to
          submit your book to.&nbsp; Once your book has been proofread
          and
          edited, you are now ready to send your book to publishing
          companies,
          along with a professional cover letter. &nbsp;<br>
