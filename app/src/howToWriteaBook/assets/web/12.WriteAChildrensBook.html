          Are you interested in writing a children’s book that you one
          day hope will be published? If you are and if you have yet to
          start writing, there are a number of important points that you
          want to take into consideration first. These important points,
          a few of which are outlined below, may help to improve your
          chances of getting your next children’s book published.<br>
          <br>
          It is important to remember that the genre of children’s books
          covers a wide range of books. When many individuals think of
          children’s books, picture books for toddlers and early reading
          books for preschoolers often come to mind. Yes, these two
          groups are major parts of the children’s genre, but there is
          so much more. Typically speaking, publishers categorize
          children’s books by picture books, early readers, transition
          books, chapter books, and young adult books. Decide what type
          of children’s book you would like to write. This will prevent
          you from falling in between two different categories.<br>
          <br>
          Next, it is important to know what children’s book publishers
          want. Not knowing what publishers want or expect from authors
          is a common mistake made. After a close examination, you will
          find that it often varies depending on the publisher. Many
          publishers state which categories of children’s books they
          publish, such as picture books or young adult books. This is
          important information to know as you will not see success by
          sending a young adult book manuscript to a publisher that is
          only looking for picture books.<br>
          <br>
          In keeping with what children’s book publishers want, it is
          also important to know what they are searching for in terms of
          themes. For example, a specific children’s book publisher may
          be seeking stories that are educational in nature or those
          that focus on a specific religion. Many well-known publishers
          are trying to stay away from talking animals for the most
          part. It doesn’t mean that you can’t take this approach, but
          you need to be careful and realistic when you do. The Writer’s
          Market book for the children’s genre outlines this information
          wherever possible. The same information may also be found
          online.<br>
          <br>
          Another note that many children’s book publishers make to
          hopeful authors to not outright preach or focus too much on
          morals in a children’s book. Of course, parents want to
          purchase children’s books that their kids can learn from, but
          you don’t want to be too pushy. If you must outright state a
          theme or good deed, such as being nice to other kids, show it
          through action and dialog in the book, but don’t outright
          state so until the end.<br>
          <br>
          Should you wish to write chapter books or books for young
          adults, you will want to open your book with an amazing
          beginning. Many professional writers and publishers recommend
          opening with action and adventure, as opposed to first just
          introducing the characters. This is because most publishers
          know that some children are hard to please with books. The
          attention of all readers and publishers needs to be captured
          right away.<br>
          <br>
          The above mentioned tips are just a few of the many that can
          help to increase your chances of getting a children’s book
          published. Any writer who hopes to be published needs to know
          the importance of research. Your chances of seeing your book
          published increase when you know what is popular with the
          market today, as well as what publishers want.<br>
