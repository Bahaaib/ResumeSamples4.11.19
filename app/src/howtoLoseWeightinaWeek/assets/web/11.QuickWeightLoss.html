            loss and long term results can be paired together. These few
            steps lay the foundation for long term weight loss and they
            are designed to build on each other. Although clients are
            told that these steps are vital to their short and long term
            weight loss success I see clients skip or dilute them all
            the time because they are so simple they often interpret
            them as tools that can be overlooked. Omitting these steps
            contributes to clients spinning their wheels when it comes
            to their quick weight loss at a time when people are
            struggling to do just the opposite. Inevitably they come
            back and implement them in to their program and start to
            lose weight.</big></font></big></p>

        <p>I may be sharing with you things that you feel you already
          know or are obvious. But it is the subtle shifts in the
          understanding, that you already have all it takes to lose
          weight, that really allows you to break free from the food. So
          let it sink in.Great, so lets get started!</p>
        <p><strong>Quick Weight Loss Comes Through Learning to Power
            Talk &amp; Making It Stick</strong></p>
        <p>I'm sure you've experienced the wonderful feeling of
          accomplishment and flow that come along with being on a path
          of growth. That sense of knowing when everything is working
          for you and you trust that all is in order, that deep sense of
          peace and expansion after you learned something new and see it
          directly impact your life. There are so many incredible
          blessings and experiences that come along with this type of
          expansion and the path to weight loss has many of them. I have
          seen so many clients literally blossom as they start to lose
          weight. They experience a flow positive understanding that,
          "yes they can do this", and feel the positive energy that
          comes along with the sense of empowerment and self
          accomplishment that shedding their weight overcoming obstacles
          brings into their life.</p>
        <p>I'm sure you have also experienced those wonderful joys where
          you think you've finally got it all figured out, your in
          control of your diet and exercise and enjoying the moments and
          successes and feel that life can finally be fully wonderful
          now. Maybe there have been times in the past where you have
          lost weight and experienced some of this but for reasons your
          not quite in touch with you put the weight back. This e-course
          will give you the tools not only to lay the foundation for
          your weight loss but it will give you the tools to experience
          the joy of a life time of your best body.</p>
        <p>So what does knock us down and keep us falling off the wagon?
          Have you ever been in the groove of being on your diet and it
          seems like nothing will be able to get you to stray? You feel
          like, "This is it the last time I will have to lose this
          weight, I am done with it and watch me go. " Then a "real
          life" experience comes up and knocks you down, pulls you out
          of that nice little energized, wonderful place you were just
          in and stops any forward momentum cold. It can be as simple as
          your partner disappoints or angers you, you feel frustrated by
          your not so fulfilling job, your kids woke up cranky and
          demanding, you feel unappreciated because everyone assumes
          you'll just do it, you feel deprived when the office birthday
          cake passes your desk and everyone else is eating it but you
          and you get angry and say "why can they eat it and I can't" or
          the pants you thought were going to fit are "oh so tight"...</p>
        <p>Whatever it is, it pulls you down into those lower emotions
          that we all hate to be stuck in. The emotions that can change
          your mood to reflect anger, sadness, unworthiness,
          frustration, fear and you head for the feel good comfort of
          food, any kind as long as it makes you forget how you are
          feeling at the moment! Although we all have our favorites.
          [Mine was always chocolate and ice cream]</p>
        <p>And as if that's not enough in itself, here comes the
          illusion that keeps so many weight loss clients stuck. That
          one thought [whatever that may be for each of us, it could be
          an issue you have been dealing with for a life time or
          something more recent. ] that takes whatever you are going
          through and makes it 10 times worse and causes you to be stuck
          WAY longer than you need to be. You keep replaying it like a
          broken record in your head feeling worse and worse.</p>
        <p>My issue was that I always felt like I had no time to myself
          and that I had to do everything or it wouldn't get done right.
          The result was that I ended up feeling overworked and very
          under appreciated. But it was my interpretation and my actions
          that caused this because I was unwilling to not be a
          perfectionist and give up some control. So instead of asking
          for help with things like laundry, dishes, vacuuming I did
          them all myself and then complained how I had to do
          everything. I felt depleted, unappreciated, disrespected and I
          ate my frustration. I now have an 80/20 rule and I ask for
          help. It doesn't have to be perfect, 80% is good enough. It
          was very freeing. I got unstuck, had less frustration and less
          turning to food for solace.</p>
        <p>Have you ever been trapped in a bad mood but can't put your
          finger on why? Trapped in your lower emotions, triggered by
          some external event that seems to have knocked you down and
          you turned to food to get distracted, feel better or even just
          to numb yourself? Chemical reactions in our food can act like
          a drug and give us a feeling of being happier, but it is only
          temporary and there are other ways of producing those
          chemicals without turning to food. After these moments when we
          turn to food after a frustrating experience have you found
          yourself asking. . .</p>
        <p>"Why can't I keep to my diet, what am I doing wrong for me to
          keep turning to food every time I get upset or tempted? What's
          wrong with me?</p>
        <p>And here you go into a downward spiral. So now, you're not
          only feeling bad dealing with the actual challenge that came
          up, you're feeling even worse because you turned to food in
          the moment and now your thinking that you have screwed up yet
          again and that's the last thing you really wanted to do! Your
          thinking that it if you just had some more self control you
          wouldn't have to be dealing with this again and again! Your
          feeling pretty bad and your blaming yourself because you
          haven't "got it right" yet.</p>
        <p>You end up feeling disappointed in yourself because of you
          keep making the same mistakes and keep falling off that diet
          wagon. It almost makes you want to give up and just live your
          life in a body your not so thrilled with and just get used to
          it. Subconsciously we may be thinking, "I'm not good enough. "</p>
        <p>We use food in so many aspects of our lives. We use it to
          celebrate, or compensate to commiserate or any other fill in
          the blank emotion. Challenges, frustrating issues at work,
          family, finances or in your relationship or lack of
          relationship. A deep sense of fear as you try to start
          something new. There are infinite forms challenges can take.
          The good news is that we can make this food issue go away by
          understanding ourselves a little bit better and directing the
          self talk a whole lot more.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><strong>Quick Weight Loss &amp; Your Moment of Frustration</strong></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>How does this translate into your moment of frustration, when
          you turn to food or other self sabotaging behaviors like
          negative self talk. Well, it's how you feel, which for most of
          us is something we totally by pass or ignore because we don't
          like feeling what we feel. Many of us never really learned how
          to deal with our feeling of frustration, sadness, anger,
          rejection, low self esteem, we just learned how to stuff them
          down inside of us where they slowly fester. Eventually they
          fester just below our threshold until BAM!</p>
        <p>They let us know they are there with that "Feeling" again. We
          are uncomfortable with the feeling hanging around us so we
          turn to food as an outlet as opposed to dealing with the issue
          at hand. Thus, the consumption of food! You only have two ways
          of feeling [of course there are different levels of it but on
          a basic level there are just two] Good or bad. So when you are
          shrinking down into those feeling after you have turned to
          food or had something happen that you don't like you are
          actually end up in a lower emotion [feeling bad]. You end up
          staying stuck in lower emotions for way too long.</p>
        <p>Until eventually, you finally get inspired to try again. I
          used to feel like this a lot, and I remember when I first
          started out on my weight loss and wellness path I would feel
          absolutely incredible for like 2 days [OK, sometimes just 2
          hours]. And then I'd crash for 3 days or a week or 2, all the
          while thinking why I screwed up again.</p>
        <p>Today, I want to share with you the first step to stop this
          self defeating behavior. This step can help you on your
          journey and help you navigate your way away from these
          feelings and negative self talk. Life isn't stagnant and your
          weight loss journey is always going to take you to a higher
          place. The secret is how you go about embracing the journey
          that keeps you in the driver's seat.</p>
        <p>We can diffuse them all. Break them down into minute pieces
          that are simple facts rather than emotional time bombs that
          make us uncomfortable or upset so we reach for the Oreo's or
          head first fast food drive through. You just have to knowingly
          use the tools that will work for you rather than against you!
          This is all part of the journey and you will learn how to
          recognize the signals and have a tool in place to diffuse the
          feeling and the action that the feeling causes.</p>
        <p>In order for you to enjoy the journey and let go of your
          constant dance with food you have to learn to step into your
          best body and best self. You must see and shift what is within
          you to match that of your vision. My coach challenge to you is
          that next time you find yourself facing a challenge that
          threatens to knock you down and have you heading for the food,
          before you jump into the illusion that you have to use food to
          deal with it take a moment.</p>
        <p>Stop! Look at the challenge. Don't make it all worse by
          criticizing yourself, or even someone else, eating up your
          frustration and then beating yourself up about it, again! Try
          the exercise below to maneuver around the situation. Remember
          that these tools take some practice but they work when used
          consistently. Don't discount them because they seem to easy.
          It is the simplicity that makes them great and effective.</p>
        <p>It is so much easier to face any challenge when you have the
          tools to deal with it. But if you really want to break free
          and are tired of being stuck, embrace the idea that these
          tools are here to help you and that you don't have to stay
          stuck for long at all. When you use them enough they become
          second nature and infused into your lifestyle, they become
          effortless.</p>

          <p><strong>Quick Weight Loss Step One - Identify Your
              Triggers, Thoughts &amp; Whys</strong></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>The thoughts you have about eating don't come out of nowhere
          although sometimes we would like to think that. There is
          always a trigger that precedes your thoughts. For example, you
          go to make dinner and open up the pantry to get a glimpse of
          the potato chip bag. Seeing the bag is the potato chips is the
          trigger. You then have a thought like "umm these look good
          I'll just have a few and pop some chips" into your mouth.
          Triggers don't automatically lead to eating, though. Your
          thoughts determine whether or not your actually eat!</p>
        <p><strong>5 Types of Triggers to Avoid if You Want Quick Weight
            Loss</strong> <br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Biological: hunger pangs, thirst, hormonally influenced
            cravings or other biological process. </li>
          <li>Environmental: seeing or smelling food, watching food on
            TV or a commercial involving food. </li>
          <li>Mental: thinking about food [ for example driving home
            thinking it's about dinner time], imaging eating some
            wonderful food, having a positive memory of some wonderful
            food you ate or a negative memory of being hungry or
            deprived.</li>
          <li>Emotional: tension, anxiety, sadness, loneliness, boredom,
            and other negative emotions also positive emotions, such as
            happiness or excitement. </li>
          <li>Social: being offered food or because you are in a social
            setting like a party.</li>
        </ul>
        Some triggers are obvious and some [like hormonal cravings that
        trigger that leads to chocolate coveting] are not. Although not
        critical it is helpful to be able to predict what's a likely
        trigger that leads you to eat so you can minimize your exposure,
        especially in the beginning of your diet. No matter what the
        trigger in your going to follow the same sequence of events to
        resist giving in to food your not supposed to eat.</big></big><big><font

              Weight Loss Step Two</strong> <br>
          </big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> <big> What makes a
          trigger powerful is how we think about it. We sabotage
          ourselves with thoughts that serve the food literally instead
          of ourselves. There are some unique differences between how
          unsuccessful dieters think compared with those who are weight
          loss successes. Both experience the same types of triggers,
          but unsuccessful dieters have certain characteristics and ways
          of thinking that can lead to failure, as illustrated in the
          chart below. Start to open your mind to the thoughts below and
          be conscious of how you are thinking when it comes to your
          feelings and foods over the next few days. Write them down if
          you feel it will help.</big> </font></big>

          <li>Learn to Power Talk: Confusion between hunger and desire
            to eat: Unsuccessful Dieter: I just ate dinner but I am
            starving! I am going to go have a snack. Successful Dieter:
            I'm not hungry; I'm just having a craving. I don't need
            those cookies. </li>
          <li>Intolerance of hunger: Unsuccessful Dieters: I can't stand
            being hungry, Successful Dieter: Hunger is mildly
            uncomfortable, but I can tolerate it. It will go away if I
            focus on something else. </li>
          <li>Desire for being over full: Unsuccessful Dieter: If I eat
            a lot,I'll be more satisfied and won't run the risk of
            getting hungry. Successful Dieter: It's OK if I get hungry.
            I'd rather get a little hungry and stay thinner than eat a
            lot and gain weight. </li>
          <li>Self Deception: Unsuccessful Dieter: It doesn't really
            matter if I eat this extra food. Successful Dieter: It does
            matter. If I eat it, I'll strengthen the habit of giving in,
            which will make it more likely that I will give in again the
            next time. I want to strengthen my 'NO' muscle! </li>
          <li>Eating as an emotional coping strategy: Unsuccessful
            Dieter: I'm upset, if I eat I will feel better. I deserve to
            indulge myself. Successful Dieter: If I eat, I'll have 2
            problems: the one that upset me in the first place and the
            one that will make me feel bad about myself. I'm going to be
            very sorry in a little while if I give in and eat this.</li>
