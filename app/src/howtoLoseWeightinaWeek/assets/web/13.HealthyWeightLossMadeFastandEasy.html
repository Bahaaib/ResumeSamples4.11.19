    <p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>If you're
            like most people, you're starting to sit up right now and
            think a little harder about your overall health and fitness.
            It's no secret that obesity rates are on the rise - all you
            really have to do is look around you and you'll see how
            grossly overweight much of our population is becoming.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font>
        <p>If action isn't taken to help put a stop to this trend, our
          health care costs are going to skyrocket and everywhere people
          will be facing dire health consequences that could literally
          put their lives in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>But, this is talking to the extreme. Unless you're currently
          in a situation where you're battling 50+ pounds you may think
          that you really don't have much to worry about. So you might
          be a little overweight - big deal. There are worse things in
          life than being able to pinch an inch - okay, maybe two if
          you're going to be honest.</p>
        <p>You're interested in learning more about fitness and do want
          to take steps to improve your health but right now, you just
          don't have the time. You have other obligations you have to
          fulfill first and when the opportunity arises, then you'll
          focus on your health and fitness.</p>
        <p>Well, I'm here to tell you that it's time for you to make
          time. Tomorrow is never going to get here and chances are,
          that schedule is never going to be freed up enough for you to
          finally be ready to step into fitness.</p>
        <p>Instead, it's time for you to dive into fitness - sprint if
          you have to because if you're like most people, you have quite
          a bit of catching up to do in the race with good health. While
          the decision to start devoting more of your time and energy to
          improving your health, bodyweight, and fitness level will be a
          completely personal decision, it's one that you should think
          very hard about.</p>
        <p>In the following information we'll be discussing the primary
          benefits that you'll see from engaging in a regular health and
          fitness program along with a few simple yet highly effective
          action steps that you can take today to get yourself onto some
          results.</p>
        <p>Remember, health and fitness doesn't need to be
          uncomfortable. Even small changes over time can lead to great
          things in the long run so do what's comfortable.</p>
        <p>Let's get started.</p>

            <p>Benefits From A Regular Exercise Program</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>First let's begin by discussing some of the main benefits
          that you'll get from a regular exercise program. For many
          people, getting more active and becoming involved in exercise
          is going to be slightly easier than the other half of the
          equation - changing their diet. Since most of us do derive
          great pleasure and enjoyment from food, changing habits in
          that area definitely proves to be quite a bit more
          challenging. But we'll be discussing diet shortly so right now
          let's focus on exercise. What benefits will a regular exercise
          program get you?</p>
        <p>Let's take a look.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big>
            <p>Increased Energy</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>First things first, one of the biggest benefits that you're
          going to see from a regular workout program is a greatly
          enhanced level of energy. Some people may think this to be the
          opposite since if they're out there expending energy in
          intense workout sessions they're going to feel drained for
          their workouts but this isn't the case at all.</p>
        <p>As you get into better shape from doing regular exercise
          you're going to find it has a direct transfer over impact on
          how you feel throughout the day. This is due to the fact that
          the body is going to be that much better conditioned so all
          the daily tasks you do on a regular basis aren't going to take
          as much out of it. Instead, you'll feel fully ready to take on
          anything that heads your way and will not feel completely
          exhausted by the time the evening rolls around.</p>
        <p>If you live a fast paced life and feel like you're on a
          constant treadmill of fatigue, regular exercise is definitely
          going to help you fight back against this in a major way.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big>
            <p>The Ability To Keep Fat Off For Good</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Second, one of the most attractive benefits of participating
          in a regular exercise program for most people is the fact that
          exercise is one of the most powerful fat fighters around. If
          you're someone who's concerned about the normal weight gain
          that most people experience with age, you simply must start
          exercising today.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big>
            <p>Why?</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Put simply, exercise is going to help to elevate your
          metabolism for hours after you've completed it so you're going
          to continue to burn calories off at an accelerated pace. Since
          the more calories you burn off each and every day the lower
          the chances you have of adding body fat, you can clearly see
          why this is so powerful in the fight against body fat. What's
          more is that chronic regular exercise will lead to long-term
          metabolic increases so then even if you do miss a workout once
          in a while, you'll still continue fighting off body fat. This
          means that you will be able to have more of the foods you
          enjoy in the future without suffering the weight gain that
          everyone around you is. With excess weight comes anxiety also.
          If that's not a good reason to exercise, I'm not sure what is.
          With regular exercise, weight gain as you get older can be
          completely eliminated.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big>
            <p>Improved Muscle Mass and Strength</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Another key reason why doing some form of exercise is
          important on a regular basis is because this is going to send
          the message to the body that you need your lean muscle mass
          tissue. Going back to our concept of metabolic rate and your
          daily calorie burn, the more lean muscle mass you have on your
          body, the more calories you are going to burn. To put this
          into perspective, for every pound of muscle mass you're going
          to burn about 30 calories more every day. That is without
          exercise - just to simply exist. Muscle mass is extremely
          energy costly so the more of it you have, the more calories
          your body is going to need to stay alive. Fat, on the other
          hand burns a measly two calories per pound per day. See the
          difference? If you gained ten pounds of muscle you'd be able
          to eat 300 calories more per day without weight gain while if
          you gained 10 pounds of fat you could eat only 60 more
          calories to maintain that tissue.</p>
        <p>Which scenario would you rather be in? Regular exercise is
          going to help you keep all the muscle mass you already have
          and possibly even help you build more so that you really crank
          up the heat and burn off more calories than ever on a daily
          basis. As you go about doing this, you're also going to see
          noticeable improvements in the amount of muscle strength you
          have, which will also be vital to help you perform all those
          daily activities you do. We typically do lose muscle mass with
          age unless exercise is performed to signal the body to keep it
          and that's the biggest reason why many people find themselves
          growing weaker in time. Exercise and you won't have to deal
          with this!</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big>
            <p>Greater Bone Health</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Moving on, if you're someone who is concerned with your
          overall bone health, it's also going to be important that you
          start up on a regular exercise program for this reason as
          well. Weight bearing exercise is going to place a very low
          level of stress on the bones and joints and as a result,
          they'll begin to grow back stronger than they were before.</p>
        <p>This, over time, can really help to prevent stress fractures
          or other issues such as osteoporosis, so isn't something that
          you'll want to overlook. Running and weight lifting tend to be
          the best activities to promote strong bones however any other
          form of activity you enjoy can do it as well. Even something
          as simple as going for a twenty minute walk every morning can
          go a long way towards strengthening your skeletal system.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big>
            <p>Improved Confidence Level</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Okay, let's get slightly superficial for a second. What
          happens when you look good?</p>
        <p>When you look good, you feel good, and what happens when you
          feel good? When you feel good, your confidence level is going
          to jump through the roof! There is definitely something to be
          said about confident people. They tend to be viewed as much
          more attractive by others and as much as some of you may not
          want to admit it, very often are treated better because of it
          as well. Confidence is sexy - there's no getting around that
          and regular exercise will really do a number to your
          confidence levels.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't have a care in the world what other people
          think of you, you should do this for yourself. Feeling
          confident in yourself will make you feel so much better as a
          whole and you'll find that you just enjoy life that much more.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><b>Enhanced Mental Clarity and Concentration</b></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>If you're someone who often finds that you tend to lose
          concentration and focus throughout the day, guess what? Yes,
          exercise can help with this too!</p>
        <p>When you exercise on a regular basis your body is going to
          release a number of 'feel good' hormones that will not only
          put you in a better mood but also help to relax the body and
          keep your mind calm and collected. This will then help to
          improve the clarity and concentration you have throughout the
          entire day whether you're at school or work or just going
          about your daily life. Many people find that exercise is a
          powerful fighter against bad moods and some will even use it
          as a means to help treat mild depression.</p>
        <p>There's no question about it, exercise is going to have a
          very good influence on your overall well-being.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><b>Improved Sleep</b></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Finally, the last benefit that you're going to get from
          regular participation in exercise is much better quality
          sleep. Those who exercise regularly have been shown to sleep
          more soundly and are also able to enter into deep sleep - the
          most important kind, much sooner than those who don't. Just do
          be sure that you're not exercising too close to bed-time
          however as that can work against you and instead just cause
          you to stay up. If you keep your workouts to at least a couple
          hours before you plan to go to sleep you shouldn't have any
          problem with this issue.</p>
        <p>So that covers some of the main benefits you're going to see
          from regular exercise. Strength training exercise, whether you
          choose to use free weights, bodyweight, or weight machines
          tends to be best for increasing your metabolic rate over the
          long term and improving the amount of muscle definition you
          see while activities like walking, jogging, swimming, and team
          sports tend to be very good for maintaining cardiovascular
          fitness, improving your moods, and helping you to sleep better
          at night.</p>
        <p>Ideally you want to do a combination of both types of
          exercise within the overall workout week but if you can only
          fit one in, remember that that will always be better than
          nothing.</p>
        <p>Finally, don't forget about flexibility training either.
          Adding ten to fifteen minutes of stretching at the end of all
          exercise sessions you do will help to increase your range of
          motion and go a long way towards preventing joint stiffness
          and immobility.</p>
        <p>Often people will find that they do tend to get very tight
          and tense as they grow older and if they aren't taking the
          time to pursue regular flexibility exercises, it's really
          going to creep up on them. <br>
          With flexibility training it doesn't take much to show
          improvements over time but if you stop performing the
          training, you'll lose whatever flexibility you do have very
          quickly.</p>
        <p>So now that we've covered the exercise aspect of leading a
          healthy lifestyle and how many benefits there are from doing
          so, now let's look at things from the nutritional point of
          view.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><b>Benefits From A Sound Nutritional Approach</b></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Notice in our heading we said 'nutritional approach', not
          'diet' approach? That's the biggest problem with most people
          today. Rather than viewing the changes they are thinking about
          making as a lifestyle strategy that they will stick with in
          the long term, they view it as a 'diet' or a quick-fix
          solution that will get dropped immediately upon them reaching
          their goal weight. The flaw in this thinking is that if you
          view it as a diet and come off just as fast as you went on,
          that weight that you lost is going to come rushing back to
          your body in a very short time period. Just like your old
          habits once caused you to gain weight, there's nothing to stop
          them from causing you to gain weight once again.</p>
        <p>If you are able to get creative in the kitchen and think of
          new recipes to try out that are much healthier than what
          you're typically eating you'll find that maintaining a healthy
          diet isn't nearly as hard as you might have once made it out
          to be.</p>
        <p>Let's now take a peak at the benefits good nutrition has to
          offer.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big>
            <p>Dramatically Enhanced Energy Levels&nbsp;</p>
          </big></big></b></div>
    <big><big>
        <p> If you thought adding more exercise to your day would boost
          your energy levels, wait until you see what eating healthier
          will do for you. When you focus on quality source of protein
          in your diet paired with slower digesting, non-processed forms
          of carbohydrates you're going to maintain steady energy levels
          that won't sputter out on you halfway through the day.</p>
        <p>What's more is that you'll find you recover from your
          exercise sessions much more quickly as well so you have more
          energy to devote to those each and every session as well.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><b>Increased Metabolism</b></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Next, we've already discussed how regular exercise can boost
          your metabolic rate, well diet can do the same. When you're
          eating a balanced diet that is slightly higher in overall
          protein content your body is really going to be burning up
          calories quickly. Since protein actually takes more energy to
          digest after eating it simply by focusing on lean sources of
          protein in your diet you can boost up your total daily calorie
          burn. Again, this is going to really help out as you work
          towards the goal of body fat loss.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><b>Better Blood Sugar Control</b></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>One thing that many people really notice improves when they
          start eating healthier is the amount of control they have over
          their blood sugar level. If you've ever had a meal and then
          felt highly energetic afterwards only to find yourself
          crashing a few hours later, you know precisely what this point
          is all about. When you eat very simple carbohydrate-rich
          foods, as they enter into your body they are quickly going to
          spike your insulin level and then afterwards, as the insulin
          sucks the glucose up into the tissues, they're going to cause
          a rapid decline in blood glucose. This translates to you feel
          on top of the world one minute and incredibly tired, cranky,
          and irritable the next. When that occurs, that's also when you
          likely head right back into the pantry in search of your next
          'quick-fix' which then starts you up on the endless cycle of
          overeating and weight gain. When you instead provide a slower
          digesting source of carbohydrates to the body your energy will
          remain ate a more moderate and constant level and you'll
          therefore bypass this cycle altogether. All of a sudden weight
          loss becomes incredibly easy and you feel great.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><b>Prevention of Body Fat Gain</b></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>When it comes to maintaining your body weight in the long run
          and preventing that yearly body fat gain, exercise is
          definitely important but more than that will be watching your
          diet. This is for the simple fact that it is way too easy to
          overconsume 500 or more calories in just minutes with a few
          poor food choices.</p>
        <p>For instance, say you, in a weak moment, decide to go in for
          that second slice of pumpkin pie. Well, that may just set you
          back a good 800 calories for that indulgence. Compare that to
          the fact that you'd literally have to run for almost an hour
          and a half straight to burn off that many calories and you can
          quickly see just how important eating right is for weight
          control. Your daily calorie intake is very easily controlled
          through proper food choices so if you want to maintain your
          body weight, getting your weight in line is a must.</p>
      </big></big>
    <div align="center"><big><big>
          <p><b>Reduced Disease Risk</b></p>
        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>Finally, the last important thing that eating a healthy diet
          will do is help to reduce your overall risk of disease
          development. If you include plenty of fresh fruits and
          vegetables within your plan you're going to be providing a
          number of antioxidants to the body that will help to promote
          good health. In addition to that you'll also be taking in all
          the essential vitamins and minerals that you need so that too
          will really help keep your body functioning smoothly. While
          you can always look to supplemental forms to help fill any
          gaps that may be present from the diet, this is never going to
          be as effective as what you'd get when you actually take the
          nutrients in from whole food sources. By focusing on eating a
          diverse diet that includes a wide array of healthy and fresh

        </big></big></div>
    <big><big>
        <p>The important thing to remember for most people is to begin
          by making gradual changes to your current daily diet and
          exercise routine. You can't expect to complete a full diet and
          workout overhaul and stick with it - in most cases this is
          simply too much to handle. If you focus on making a few easier
          changes each week though, week by week, you will move much
          closer to your end goals. That's what the following action
          plan has set out to do. With each step you'll focus on doing
          something different from what you normally do that will take
          you one step closer to being the healthiest you ever. If you
          need to stick with a step for a few days in order to feel
          comfortable with it, If you find you already do one of the
          steps listed - great, keep doing it. As you progress along
          through this action plan it's also important that you make
          sure to keep up all the habits that you've changed. Don't let
          yourself slip back into your old ways but instead keep
          pressing forward and you will be that much further ahead.</p>
        <p>So get ready - here is your plan of ACTION. Don't just sit
          back and read through it - actually do it. Remember, time is
          your greatest commodity in life - once it's spent you can
          never get it back so make sure that you're doing everything
          possible to live each moment to the fullest. Living the
          healthy lifestyle is going to do accomplish that goal
          wonderfully.</p>
