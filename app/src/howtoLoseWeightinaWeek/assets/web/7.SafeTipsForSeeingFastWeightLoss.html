        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Are you
          waiting
          to begin your weight loss? Are you unsure how you can lose
          weight, and
          intimidated at the thought of beginning? Don't worry- everyone
          has to
          start somewhere, and this article is here to give you the best
          chance
          by outlining tips to get your body in shape.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To stay
          on track
          with your weight loss program, weigh yourself every day. Not
          only does
          this make it impossible for you to deny when you stay off
          course, but
          it also clearly shows even the smallest of progress. Just make
          sure
          your scale is properly calibrated and weigh at the same time
          every day
          to avoid natural fluctuations.</span><br style="font-family:

        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Help
          yourself
          lose weight at work by making changes to work habits that
          don't help
          your goal. Instead of gossiping in the breakroom, walk around
          the block
          or up and down the stairwell. Stay away from the vending
          machine by
          bringing healthier snacks to work. Nosh on almonds, walnuts,
          low fat
          granola bars, or celery sticks with peanut butter to help keep
          hunger
          cravings away.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You do
          not have
          to go on a fad diet to lose weight all you have to do is eat
          smaller
          portions. Many people do not realize that if they just cut
          back on
          their portion sizes that they are eating they will be able to
          lose
          weight very quickly. This also helps to not feel deprived from
          foods
          that you love.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Drink the
          recommended amount of water every day. Usually, this is eight
          glasses
          of water but when you are active you will want to increase the
          amount
          you drink so you will stay hydrated. Drinking water will also
          keep you
          from getting hungry as often and prevent you from eating as
          much.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">To
          enhance your
          weight loss efforts, you should try keeping a diary. By
          maintaining a
          journal, you can pinpoint triggers for emotional eating and
          overeating.
          To keep a weight loss diary, simply record what you eat and
          what you
          are thinking or feeling at the time, for example, whether you
          are
          feeling stressed or tired.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Remember
          as a
          dieter that most diets out there will only maintain your
          weight after a
          certain amount of time. So if you want to keep on losing the
          weight,
          you will have to continue to push yourself harder and harder.
          Once you
          lose the desired amount of weight, then you can coast through
          on
          maintenance mode.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Don't
          traumatize
          yourself by eliminating foods that you enjoy, just decrease
          portions
          and frequency. If you eliminate those foods that you love most
          from
          your diet completely, you will discourage yourself and find
          that it is
          more difficult to lose weight. However, if you simply reduce
          your
          intake and the frequency of that intake, you can still enjoy
          these
          foods without feeling too guilty.</span><br

        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Now that
          you
          have the secrets of weight loss at your disposal, you're ready
          to begin
          a program to shed some pounds and start feeling and looking
          great! Wait
          until you can fit into your old clothes again! </span><br
