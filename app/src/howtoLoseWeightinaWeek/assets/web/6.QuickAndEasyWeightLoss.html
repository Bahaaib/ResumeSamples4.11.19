        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Those of
          us who
          have struggled to lose weight know that it can often be an
          extremely
          frustrating task and that actual results often feel very
          elusive. It
          can feel maddening to try so hard, yet not see our efforts
          reflected on
          the scale, and many of us wind up feeling defeated. This
          article
          discusses proven methods of weight loss that will help you
          avoid those
          frustrating times.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">In order
          to lose
          weight you should evaluate your diet and add in healthy foods
          that you
          are currently lacking. The reason for concentrating on missing
          foods,
          rather than removing what you know you shouldn't eat, is that
          good
          foods are more filling and more nutritious. If you are
          satisfied and
          healthy you will naturally crave less junk food, feel more
          energetic
          and take better care of yourself.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Don't buy
          into
          the "crash diet" hype. More often than not, these diets do
          more harm
          than good. Usually, many of them simply do not work. Some do,
          but the
          ones that do give results offer no long-term plan to continue
          the
          weight loss after the first 30 or however many days the diet
          is
          supposed to last.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It
          definitely
          can benefit you if you try to make friends with people that
          are healthy
          and fit. You can look to them as a model for what you want to
          be like.
          They can also give you great tips that they use to keep the
          weight off.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">It is
          common
          practice to increase the intensity of a workout routine to
          shed extra
          pounds, but it is also a good idea to increase the density-
          the amount
          of work done in the time frame allowed. This method will
          increase your
          stamina and endurance while also helping you drop a size or
          two.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Lose
          weight with
          walking. With walking you can burn up to 500 calories per hour
          of
          walking depending on the path you walk and the steps you are
          taking.
          Walking will also help you to feel less hungry and keeps the
          blood flow
          from your digestive system. Start slow walking 10 to 15
          minutes twice a
          day then increase.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">When
          eating out,
          avoid all fried foods if you're serious about your weight. It
          may be ok
          to fry foods at home, but when you are in a restaurant you
          have no idea
          what kind of oils they use and what kind of flour they use.
          Stick to
          non-fried foods instead so you don't ruin your diet.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You
          should bring
          your own lunch to work instead of trying to buy one from a
          restaurant
          or the work cafeteria. Not only will this save you money, but
          it will
          give you the opportunity to be in control of your fat and
          caloric
          intake.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
