          There is a lot of great information in this app. Here is how
          to use it:<br>
          <br>
          Read through the articles and make some notes about the ideas
          that could work for you. We're all different and there are
          several approaches that you could take. Please note that the
          content here has been carefully considered but we do not give
          any assurance about the health claims made for the foods and
          diets provided in this app.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          You should carry out proper research from recognised
          authorities regarding the health claims made for certain
          foods. You really should consult a suitable professionally
          qualified doctor, dietician or medical expert about any health
          claims made for particular foods or diets and you should see
          your doctor if you are concerned about your health or diet or
          if you intend to embark upon changing your diet or exercise
          regime.<br>
          <br>
          The app has a BMI Calculator and an Exercise Calorie Counter
          which may be useful for you.&nbsp; <br>
          <br>
          Enjoy the app. We hope it helps you a great deal.<br>
