          I went on my first diet around five years ago. Over the past
          four and a half years my weight went up and down as I tried
          every diet and exercise program under the sun. Nothing seemed
          to work for me. Until six months ago I enrolled in a weight
          workshop which taught me that I need to change the way I look
          at food. It was then that I realized that I had made many
          mistakes in my quest to lose weight.<br>
          <br>
          In this article I’m going to share with you eight mistakes I
          made on my quest to lose weight. I hope by sharing my
          experiences with others throughout the world via the internet
          I might be able to help people avoid the mistakes I made. So,
          here are the eight mistakes I made while trying to lose
          weight.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. I started to skip breakfast</b><br>
          <br>
          Most people trying to lose weight believe simply eating less
          and skipping meals helps shed that fat. And breakfast is a
          real easy meal to skip. This is one of the biggest mistakes
          you can make when on a weight loss diet. If you leave the
          house in the morning on an empty stomach you’re much more
          tempted to eat more at morning tea and lunch times. And,
          calories you eat at breakfast time are easily burnt throughout
          the day.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. I would eat one day and not the next</b><br>
          <br>
          I would literally eat about 2000+ calories one day, feel
          guilty, and end up eating about 700 calories the following
          day. If you “starve” yourself throughout the day you’re much
          more likely to eat more in the evenings, which is not going to
          help you lose weight. You should consume most of your calories
          in the morning.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. I bought diet food</b><br>
          <br>
          When I went shopping I always looked for the foods marked
          diet, low-fat, healthy etc. This is a good practice to get
          into, but I was buying these foods for the wrong reason. I
          bought these foods because in my mind it meant I could more. I
          would totally disregard portion size. If you eat diet foods in
          large portions you’re not doing yourself any favors.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. I thought I’d always be fat</b><br>
          <br>
          This is mindset that you must break if you want to lose some
          serious weight. Sometimes it feels like you’re doing the right
          things and not making any progress, this is totally natural.
          You need to focus on being happy and healthy and achieving
          your goals. Try not to get caught up in “the big picture”.<br>
          <br>
          <b>5. I started eating salads as main meals</b><br>
          <br>
          Eating salad is a good way of keeping your calorie intake down
          right? Yes, meal of salad has much less calories that a pizza
          but does it have the satisfaction? When you eat you mind needs
          to get some satisfaction from what you have just eaten. I
          found that when I ate salads for meals a few hours later I was
          back I the cupboard looking for more food. I learnt that I was
          better off eating a balanced meal with slightly more calories
          than simply eating a salad and snacking afterwards.<br>
          <br>
          <b>6. I started my new diets on Mondays</b><br>
          <br>
          When I found a new diet that I decided I was going to try I
          always started it on a Monday. This meant I would eat all
          weekend like I was never going to eat again. Doing this I was
          just setting myself up for failure.<br>
          <br>
          <b>7. I was to embarrassed to go to the gym</b><br>
          <br>
          Taking the plunge and joining a gym was one of the hardest
          things I ever did. I was always worried that people in the gym
          would be staring at me and talking about me. I really thought
          I was too fat to join. My advice is to join a gym! You’ll be
          glad you did. I look forward to going to the gym now.<br>
          <br>
          <b>8. I set my goals to high</b><br>
          <br>
          Setting long term goals is great, but these goals always seem
          to far off. You need to set smaller, more reachable goals that
          you can regularly meet to keep your motivation high. Set
          yourself weekly, monthly and three monthly goals. Once you
          meet one short term goal set a new one for next week.<br>
          <br>
          So there you have it, those are the mistakes I made. I now
          look at weight loss from a totally different perspective and
          it has paid off. I now help others with weight loss and
          keeping healthy.<br>
