        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Those of
          us who
          have struggled to lose weight know that it can often be an
          extremely
          frustrating task and that actual results often feel very
          elusive. It
          can feel maddening to try so hard, yet not see our efforts
          reflected on
          the scale, and many of us wind up feeling defeated. This
          article
          discusses proven methods of weight loss that will help you
          avoid those
          frustrating times.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Stop
          spreading
          cream cheese or butter on your morning bagel. Instead use a
          butter
          substitute. You can also try spreads like peanut butter or
          almond
          butter. These are both lower in calories and fat. Peanut
          butter even
          contains protein. Protein is great for your body and if you
          are
          exercising properly, will help you lose weight faster.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Remember
          that it
          takes about twenty one days to make or a break a habit. Once
          you fall
          into that habit, it will be much easier to shed those extra
          pounds.
          Making something your habit will allow you to do it daily and
          will make
          it much easier to lose weight.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Do not
          ignore
          your cravings. Foods like ice cream and chips are delicious.
          Cravings
          for unhealthy foods like these can kick into overdrive when
          you are on
          a diet. Try not to cave, but don't completely ignore these
          cravings
          either. Instead, get rid of the craving entirely with a
          low-calorie
          alternative.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Some
          restaurants
          make it easy to determine which choices will be smartest for
          those on a
          diet. Others, not so much. If the menu doesn't make it clear,
          ask your
          server to indicate the healthiest choices available on the
          menu. If
          nothing looks appropriate, and that does happen, ask your
          server if
          they can make you up a fresh fruit plate or whether they have
          any
          vegetarian options. Restaurant cooks appreciate the chance to
          cook
          something off-menu, and you'll get a healthier meal.</span><br
          style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Keep your
          weight
          loss permanent by eating natural foods. Avoid all processed
          foods and
          choose fruits, vegetables and healthy proteins. Even if you
          don't like
          cooking, plenty of fresh veggies are available in frozen form
          for
          quick, healthy meals. Read labels, and remember that the more
          ingredients listed on the label, the worse the food is for
          maintaining
          your weight loss.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One of
          the most
          effective motivators for adhering to your weight loss goal is
          by
          finding a way to emphasize your successes to prevent your
          missteps. You
          can do this by taking "before" and "after" pictures of
          yourself during
          your weight loss journey. While you won't see the difference
          overnight,
          taking your picture once every week will make it easier to see
          how far
          you've come.</span><br style="font-family:
          Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <br style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
        <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">One way
          to
          prevent yourself from snacking after meals is to brush your
          teeth right
          after every meal. Not only will your pearly whites maintain
          their
          natural beauty, toothpaste will make almost any food seem
          unappetizing.
          Using mouthwash is also a good idea, as it achieves the same
          goal and
          kills bacteria in your mouth as well.</span><br
