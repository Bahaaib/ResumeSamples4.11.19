    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Try to add as many of these tips to your daily routine, and
          you will surely be well on the way to a slimmer, healthier
          you. We don’t get fat “overnight” – so you should expect it to
          take a certain amount of time to lose that weight again, but
          don’t give up! Persistence, Determination and Grit - They
          should be your watchwords. These tips work – if you stick to
          your plan!<br>
          <br>
          1. Eliminate one tablespoon of fat a day and you will lose 10
          pounds in a year.<br>
          <br>
          2. Avoid strange fad diets—if you can’t eat that way for the
          rest of your life, don’t waste your time or your health.<br>
          <br>
          3. Limit alcohol consumption - each serving contains 100 to
          150 calories.<br>
          <br>
          4. Eat fruit at least twice a day.<br>
          <br>
          5. Keep a food diary about your food choices, indicating how
          hungry you are each time you eat. Pay particular attention to
          your level of hunger when you snack.<br>
          <br>
          6. Perform aerobic exercise a minimum of 30 minutes three
          times a week. Log this on your food diary. Aerobic means any
          exercise that increases your breathing and heart rate. Walking
          is fine! Do only what you can to begin with. If you have other
          health problems, consult your doctor before embarking on any
          strong physical exercise.<br>
          <br>
          7. Gradually increase the length and frequency of your
          workouts.<br>
          <br>
          8. Weigh yourself no more than twice a week. And do it in the
          morning after going to the bathroom – it’s the most accurate
          reading.<br>
          <br>
          9. Give yourself a non-food reward for every 5 pounds lost.<br>
          <br>
          10. Slow down your eating speed—make meals last at least 20
          minutes. Try eating with the other hand or taking a sip of
          water between bites.<br>
          <br>
          11. Use smaller plates.<br>
          <br>
          12. Bring your lunch to work at least three times a week.<br>
          <br>
          13. Start to strength train twice a week as your fitness
          improves. Building muscle increases your metabolism and forces
          your body to use fat, not muscle, when you’re cutting back on
          calories. Cut down on carbohydrates and stick to lean white
          meat and fish, and you will notice vast improvements here.<br>
          <br>
          14. Stop eating while watching television.<br>
          <br>
          15. Have someone else put away leftovers.<br>
          <br>
          16. Buy a good low-fat, low-calorie cookbook or magazine
          subscription.<br>
          <br>
          17. Try two new reduced-calorie recipes a month.<br>
          <br>
          18. IMPORTANT - Eat breakfast daily. This suppresses the
          appetite for most of the day and provides fuel for the brain
          while at work or looking after the kids! You will feel better
          and have more energy all day if you eat a low fat cereal in
          the morning.<br>
          <br>
          19. Don’t read while eating.<br>
          <br>
          20. Have a sweet treat once a week.<br>
          <br>
          21. Keep healthful snacks at home and at work.<br>
          <br>
          22. Limit your cheese consumption to reduce fat and saturated
          fat—use cheese and lunchmeat with less than 5 grams of fat per
          ounce.<br>
          <br>
          23. Add calorie counting or fat-gram counting to your food
          diary for a few weeks if your weight loss is slowing down.
          Maybe you’re missing something.<br>
          <br>
          24. Substitute herbs and spices for salt.<br>
          <br>
          25. Shop for food when you are not hungry, and use a shopping
          list.<br>
          <br>
          26. Replace ground beef with ground turkey or soy crumbles in
          dishes such as spaghetti. Don’t skip the protein in your
          meals; find a leaner substitute.<br>
          <br>
          27. Eat three vegetables a day.<br>
          <br>
          28. Always eat sitting down.<br>
          <br>
          29. Request that your family and friends respect your efforts
          to lose weight and get fit—beware of loving “sabotage.”<br>
          <br>
          30. Take a walk when you’re stressed or angry.<br>
          <br>
          31. Eat two dairy products a day—be aware of your calcium
          intake. Select low-fat or nonfat dairy products to reduce fat
          calories.<br>
          <br>
          32. Order dressings and sauces on the side and apply them with
          a fork.<br>
          <br>
          33. Increase your fiber intake—chose whole-grain breads,
          cereals and pasta products, legumes, and raw fruits and
          vegetables.<br>
          <br>
          34. Add slow-down food to your meals—crunchy vegetables, a
          large glass of water, hot soup or beverages, or fresh fruit to
          fill you up.<br>
          <br>
          35. Cook with chicken broth, nonstick cooking spray, wine or
          water.<br>
          <br>
          36. Drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day.<br>
          <br>
          37. Shrink portion sizes of meats and starches, and pile on
          the vegetables.<br>
          <br>
          38. Ask how the food is prepared when ordering in a
          restaurant.<br>
          <br>
          39. Choose low-fat frozen yogurt or frozen juice bars instead
          of ice cream. Be careful of the portion size - these foods
          still have calories!<br>
          <br>
          40. Select clear broth- or tomato-based soups over white
          soups.<br>
          <br>
          41. Keep the junk foods out of sight in your home and
          workplace.<br>
          <br>
          42. Take walking shoes or a jump rope with you when you travel
          to keep up with your exercise.<br>
          <br>
          43. If you’re getting off track, try to pre-plan your food
          intake for the next three days by writing it down.<br>
          <br>
          44. Buy frozen diet dinners with 10 grams of fat or less and
          800 milligrams of sodium or less.<br>
          <br>
          45. Avoid batter coating or breading.<br>
          <br>
          46. Use two egg whites in baking instead of one whole egg.<br>
          <br>
          47. Stretch during television commercials—arm circles, leg
          lifts, head tilts, etc.<br>
          <br>
          48. Eliminate the butter on your rolls or popcorn.<br>
          <br>
          49. Learn to say “no” gracefully when a friend or relative
          offers you a second helping.<br>
          <br>
          50. Choose pizza with vegetable toppings rather than high-fat
          meats, such as sausage and pepperoni.<br>
          <br>
          51. Ask for less cheese. Have you ever tried tomato pie?<br>
          <br>
          52. Choose cooking techniques that keep fat to a minimum, such
          as baking, grilling, broiling, roasting or steaming.<br>
          <br>
          53. Add more low-fat soy products to your diet for the soy
          protein and health benefits.<br>
          <br>
          54. Forgive yourself when you slip—and make the next food
          choice a healthy one.<br>
