          Doing research and writing research papers does not actually
          have to be
          as horrible as everyone makes it out to be. I have learned to
          enjoy the
          process of research from start to finish. Call me crazy if you
          will,
          but I guarentee that the future of your educational career can
          be much
          more enjoyable if you learn now to enjoy research. For me,
          enjoying it
          started with choosing the right research topics.<br>
          <br>
          Whether you are in high school, college, gradudate school or
          are
          writing for your doctorate degree, research is an inevitable
          part of
          education. For me, it wasn't until I was nearly finished with
          my
          undergraduate college degree that I had a revelation about
          research
          that changed my whole perspective. These are the simple and
          somewhat
          obvious things that came to me. <br>
          <br>
          First, I had to do research projects and papers to make it
          through
          school. There was no way around it. Second, I knew from
          experience that
          everything in life is harder when you do not enjoy what you're
          doing. I
          determined to find a way to make researching enjoyable for me.
          Third, I
          made researching enjoyable by deciding to only research about
          things
          that I really cared about. The transformation came when I
          decided that
          no matter what, I was only going to choose research topics
          that I
          really cared about, even if it made my projects harder or
          longer.<br>
          <br>
          As soon as I started choosing great research topics I found
          that the
          entire process of creating a research project or writing a
          research
          paper was easier, more enjoyable, and less stressful for me. I
          no
          longer spent hours trying to learn about the ancient history
          of tribes
          I knew or cared nothing about. <br>
          <br>
          Instead, I began to choose research topics such as the history
          of
          soccer or the development of education in Africa. Of course,
          the things
          that excite me will likely be things that bore other people to
          death.
          But, you see, that is the beauty of it. If everyone destined
          to write
          research papers commits to choosing only research topics that
          they
          love, everyone will learn from each other and enjoy the
          process.<br>
          <br>
          So, my advice to you, fellow student, is simple. Never let
          yourself
          start the long process of research with a research topic that
          you could
          care less about. Commit in advance to finding a research topic
          that
          excites you and begin from there. You will be so glad you did,
          and your
          projects and papers will probably be better off as well.<br>
