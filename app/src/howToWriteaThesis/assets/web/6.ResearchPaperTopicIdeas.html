          The first source of research paper topic ideas should always
          come from
          your academic faculty. Usually the head of your course will
          provide a
          list of research paper topics and you will be required to pick
          one
          which you are interested in.<br>
          <br>
          Some universities do allow students to suggest research topic
          ideas but
          it will not be a completely free choice. The Head of Faculty
          will need
          to be convinced that your ideas are relevant to the course and
          there is
          a suitably qualified tutor to supervise. This can rule out
          many topic
          ideas.<br>
          <br>
          When choosing your research paper topic ideas, go online.
          Finding
          information on research paper&nbsp; ideas from the internet is
          relatively easy given the search capabilities now available.
          The more
          information available the easier it may appear but this is not
          always
          the case.<br>
          <br>
          Research papers, by definition, must be based on research you
          do
          yourself. Sometimes research paper topic ideas are rejected
          because the
          research has already been done and too much information is
          available.
          Ideally basic background information should be available but
          information on the specific research paper should be limited.<br>
          <br>
          When topic ideas there are a number of considerations that
          must be
          taken into account.<br>
          <br>
          WHICH COLLEGE YEAR IS THE PAPER FOR?<br>
          <br>
          In the first 2 years of college education it is common for an
          instructor or professor of a large class to assign a very
          general
          topics as opposed to specific topics. He or she could be
          reading 200
          papers on the Gold Rush in California otherwise.<br>
          <br>
          As a result you have more freedom to choose sub-topics and
          fresh,
          different approaches are welcome. Search for a sub-topic you
          are
          interested in and look for a fresh approach. At this level
          your tutors
          are not looking for original research but at how you gather
          and present
          your evidence.<br>
          <br>
          In the third and final years of a first degree, and certainly
          if you
          are doing a higher degree, the research paper topics will be
          much more
          specific and will involve a progressively higher degree of
          original
          research.<br>
          <br>
          In every case always go for something that you care about
          otherwise
          just the process of researching the idea will be a miserable
          experience
          for you. Your tutors will also be less than thrilled as your
          lack of
          interest is likely to result in a boring paper. For a tutor
          there's
          nothing worse than having to read a large number of boring
          papers from
          disinterested students.<br>
          <br>
          WHICH FORMAT WORKS BEST?<br>
          <br>
          Think about the different formats or types of papers there
          are, and the
          different types that you have written. There are process
          papers,
          chronological studies, theories, surveys, discussion papers,
          papers
          that study the cause and effect(s) of an event or a behavior,
          papers
          that are arguments-including both the pro and con sides, and
          many more.<br>
          <br>
          If the instructor has outlined the format required then use
          the
          required format. Don't try to be clever and pick a different
          format. If
          no format is specified then pick a format that suits your
          style. It's
          always easier to write in the format that you are comfortable
          with.<br>
          <br>
          WHERE DO YOU LOOK?<br>
          <br>
          Your starting point should always be the research paper topic
          idea
          given by your tutor. Within the restrictions set by your tutor
          specific
          ideas can be taken from any source. Current affairs and the
          real world
          often present a different perspective - particularly in
          humanities
          subjects.<br>
          <br>
          Previous research papers are often available in the library.
          Take a
          look as they often give ideas on a different slant excluded in
          the
          completed thesis. A well written research thesis will explain
          the
          limitations of the research and looking beyond the limitations
          can
          provide fresh ideas.<br>
          <br>
          Online look up the research paper topic ideas available and
          read the
          related web pages. Go to the online forums, there may be one
          one your
          topic, and see what is being discussed. This can be an
          excellent source
          of ideas for any form of written assessment.<br>
          <br>

          topic ideas.
