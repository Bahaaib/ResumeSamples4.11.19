          Every college student knows that at the end of their last year
          of
          college, they are bound to make an extraordinarily long and
          hard paper
          for their professor. This may be of any topic, as long it it
          related to
          their course or degree. <br>
          <br>
          Thesis writing is crucial in determining the academic standing
          of the
          student, an intricate project that would allow them the chance
          to
          finally graduate from college. It is the last designated work
          for them,
          and their thesis would be one of the bases for their final
          grade. The
          thesis may be submitted in the form of the written paper or
          dissertation, documentary films, case studies, or even actual
          projects
          or proto-type machines or designs.<br>
          <br>
          A student on his last year in college truly understands the
          importance
          of thesis writing. Not only is it the final requirement for
          graduation,
          the thesis also allow the student to prove his ability to
          understand
          and apply his course to solve a given problem, which then
          serves as the
          rationale for the study.<br>
          <br>
          The thesis is supposed to show the student's critical
          analysis,
          presentation skills, writing ability, and discipline in doing
          all the
          necessary research and background.&nbsp; Ideally, the thesis
          is also
          supposed to demonstrate how the students will fare in the real
          world in
          terms of their ability to prepare their research materials,
          establish
          contacts, and make sense of each and every problem or issue
          they will
          encounter.<br>
          <br>
          Making a thesis paper can be truly stressful experience.&nbsp;
          Most
          college students see thesis making as the “main event” in
          their college life.&nbsp; The excitement lies in getting
          together as a
          group, spending long days and sleepless nights doing research
          and
          re-writing drafts.&nbsp; What often puzzles college students
          is the
          ability of their thesis adviser to see every minute detail
          that needs
          to be corrected, every single time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, the
          initial
          excitement of doing the thesis eventually wears
          off.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
          excitement is replaced by stress, fatigue, and anxiety,
          emotional and
          physical distresses that naturally come with such an arduous
          academic
          task.<br>
          <br>
          Anxiety actually occurs even before the start of the act of
          thesis
          writing. It starts with the student's need to identify and
          seek
          approval for a proposed thesis topic. If done as a group, some
          members
          will get anxious about meeting deadlines and the need to
          ensure that
          everybody cooperate in doing the research. Feelings of worry
          and fear
          are often felt during the thesis writing process since they
          always have
          to follow strict format rules and guidelines, and they have to
          get the
          approval of their professor at every step of the writing
          process.&nbsp;
          Feelings of restlessness, tension, irritability, and headaches
          are
          signs of anxiety that thesis group mates are bound to
          experience.
          However, to feel anxiety is quite normal since the students
          will
          usually be doing their undergraduate thesis for the very first
          time,
          with absolutely no benefit of previous experience.<br>
          <br>
          The last part of the thesis writing process is actually causes
          more
          anxiety among the thesis writers.&nbsp; Facing a panel
          interview is not
          exactly something that a thesis writer or a thesis group looks
          forward
          to. &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          Defending every word in every page to a panel of professors
          can
          actually make students experience performance anxiety.&nbsp;
          Some
          thesis writers try to overcome performance anxiety by
          practicing their
          defense weeks before the actual panel interview.&nbsp; Anxiety
          cannot
          be avoided in these situations, and the best way to deal with
          it is for
          students to be ready and confident with their thesis approach,
          findings
          and possible defense or responses to possible questions about
          their
          work. Those who overcome performance anxiety usually do well
          in the
          panel review and get good grades for their thesis,<br>
          <br>
          For many college students, the words thesis and anxiety go
          together.&nbsp; But those who overcome their worries about the
          thesis
          are rewarded their much sought-after college degree, and the
          opportunity to try&nbsp; out solving real problems in the real
          world
          beyond the college campus.<br>
