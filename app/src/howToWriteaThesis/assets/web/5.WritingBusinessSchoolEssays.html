          Business school is probably one of the most unique challenges
          you'll
          face beyond college.&nbsp; For one, there are certain
          requirements
          you'll have to complete and for another, it does require you
          to produce
          essays as part of admissions.&nbsp; Some programs make it even
          tougher,
          obliging applicants to produce not just one but multiple
          essays.&nbsp;
          So how significant is this to you? &nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          It's an indication that business schools place extra emphasis
          on your
          ability to communicate your ideas, your initiative and
          vision.&nbsp;
          It's also an indication that they put special consideration
          for your
          practical experience.&nbsp; That means you will have to put
          some
          serious thought into the preparation of your business school
          essays.<br>
          <br>
          What your essay will contain:<br>
          <br>
          What you will write about will depend on the demands of the
          particular
          program you're applying for.&nbsp; Generally, though, you will
          be asked
          to explain why you chose that program.&nbsp; You will be also
          asked to
          write about your short- and long-term goals, your past working
          or
          business experience and how you think that particular business
          program
          will be beneficial to your career and your future.&nbsp; You
          will also
          be asked to write about key changes in your life that made you
          decide
          to pursue that particular career path.<br>
          <br>
          Writing your business school essay:<br>
          <br>
          You might find it difficult to begin writing the very first
          sentence in
          your business school essay but once you've begun, you will
          find that it
          will flow naturally from there.&nbsp; To help you create a
          solid essay
          that is relevant, here are some important considerations you
          must keep
          in mind:<br>
          <br>
          Keep your focus on the theme of your essay.<br>
          It's easy to get carried away in your essay, especially if
          you're very
          passionate about what you're writing about.&nbsp; Keep in mind
          that
          your essay is a reflection of your personality.&nbsp; If it's
          cohesive
          and well-written, you will be viewed as an organized
          individual who is
          capable of presenting his ideas in a format that people will
          like and
          understand.<br>
          <br>
          Don’t meander from one topic to the next.&nbsp; Mention
          something
          only if it is beneficial or related to your essay.&nbsp; If
          not, keep
          the anecdote for some other more appropriate time.<br>
          <br>
          Be concise.<br>
          <br>
          Don’t try to overwhelm or awe the admissions department by
          flooding them with words.&nbsp; You're dealing with
          professionals here,
          who probably have more experience sifting through business
          school
          essays than you have years spent in school.<br>
          <br>
          Use active verbs to imply action and initiative.&nbsp; Keep
          your
          sentences short but complete and be direct to the point.&nbsp;
          Don’t speak as if you're telling them a mysterious tale.&nbsp;
          Use what valuable paper space you have to convince them that
          you are
          the right candidate for the program.<br>
          <br>
          Watch your structure.<br>
          <br>
          This is post-collegiate level you're pursuing.&nbsp; Make sure
          you
          write for such level.&nbsp; Don’t make the admissions
          department
          think they're reading an essay written by a
          highschooler.&nbsp; Take
          note of the technicalities of the language, watch your
          spelling and
          grammar.&nbsp; If some sentences are too short, use transition
          words
          such as furthermore, consequently, nevertheless, etc.<br>
          <br>
          Be interesting.<br>
          <br>
          Don’t bore your readers with a half-baked effort.&nbsp;
          Remember
          that apart from you, there are couple of hundred (at least)
          other
          applicants for the program.&nbsp; If your essay doesn’t stand
          out, the admissions department will have a hard time
          remembering you
          and your essay.<br>
          <br>
          If you have weaknesses, don’t highlight them.&nbsp; Instead,
          address them.&nbsp; Your essay gives you the opportunity to
          tell your
          program director what you have done to try to improve
          yourself.<br>
          <br>
          Don’t be afraid to revise your essay.<br>
          <br>
          If you can ask anyone – a family member or a friend – to
          read your essay and give you good advice, do so.&nbsp;
          Reactions from
          knowledgeable third parties usually help.&nbsp; If your
          business school
          essay doesn’t stand too well, revise it.&nbsp; Edit, re-write
          and
          if necessary, re-write it once more until you come up with an
          essay
          that puts your personality, educational background and
          experience in a
          good light.<br>
