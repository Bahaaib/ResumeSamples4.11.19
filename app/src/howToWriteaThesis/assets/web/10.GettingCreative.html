          Most doctoral theses and dissertations are produced as a block
          of printed paper, with the final version bound into a book.
          Those studying arts subjects may present a shorter written
          work that forms the theoretical framework for one or more
          artworks presented alongside the written work as part of the
          thesis or dissertation. These artworks could be, for example,
          a collection of poems, a piece of prose fiction, a short play
          or screenplay, a performance piece such as a dramatic
          monologue or interpretive dance, an art exhibition or
          installation, a musical arrangement or composition, or
          experimental work crossing artistic boundaries.<br>
          <br>
          In recent years some doctoral students in non-arts disciplines
          have begun to take a creative approach to their theses or
          dissertations. For example, Anne Harris from Australia, an
          education researcher, was awarded her doctorate in 2010. She
          presented seven video films as part of her thesis on the
          educational experiences of Sudanese refugee women in
          Australia. Each film accompanies and complements one chapter
          of her written thesis.<br>
          <br>
          Nick Sousanis, another education researcher, studied the
          importance of visual thinking in teaching and learning at
          Columbia University in New York. He was awarded his doctorate
          in 2014, and chose to present his doctoral dissertation as a
          132-page graphic novel called Unflattening, which was
          published in 2015 by Harvard University Press. Benjamin Dix, a
          British visual ethnographer, also used the graphic novel
          format for presenting his thesis on complex human rights
          testimonies. He was awarded his PhD in 2016 and has received
          Arts Council funding to convert his thesis into a graphic
          novel.<br>
          <br>
          From Canada, Patrick Stewart, a First Nation architect, wrote
          a doctoral dissertation called Indigenous Architecture through
          Indigenous Knowledge with almost no capital letters or
          punctuation, as a form of resistance to the unthinking
          acceptance of English language conventions. He received his
          doctorate in 2015.<br>
          <br>
          Even some hard scientists are taking a creative approach to
          writing their dissertations or theses. For example, Piper
          Harron, a doctoral mathematician at Princeton University in
          the US, was awarded her PhD in 2016. She named her
          dissertation The Liberated Mathematician, and included in each
          chapter a section for ‘the layperson’, another for ‘the
          initiated’, and a third for ‘the mathematician’ – and a whole
          lot of jokes.<br>
          <br>
          I didn’t know all this till I asked on social media. From
          Facebook, which just goes to show that social media is
          awesome.)<br>
          <br>
          If you’re going to take some kind of creative approach to the
          presentation of your thesis or dissertation, it’s best to plan
          ahead if possible. However, some doctoral students may not
          realise until late in the process that they both want to, and
          can, do something a little different from the norm. If this
          applies to you, depending on what the difference is that you
          have in mind, it may still be possible. Producing a whole
          graphic novel at a late stage might be too big an ask – though
          if you are a talented artist and writer, maybe not. However,
          options such as weaving data excerpts in with your writing, or
          using a particular kind of format or structure for your
          dissertation or thesis, could be implemented in the last
          months of doctoral study.<br>
          <br>
          Also, if you want to be just a little bit creative, it may be
          possible to take an experimental approach to a single chapter
          or section of your thesis or dissertation. I did this with my
          thesis: I wrote a chapter, on reflexivity, as a fictional
          story. That was an interesting challenge for me, and my
          examiners appreciated the change of pace. Alternatively, you
          could use a metaphor to draw your argument together. For
          example, Australian education researcher Deborah Netolicky,
          who was awarded her PhD in 2016, used themes and characters
          Alice in Wonderland as an extended metaphor to help structure
          her thesis. Or, again, you could do this in a smaller way, in
          a single chapter or section.<br>
          <br>
          I would have liked to use a fictional style for my whole
          thesis, but my supervisors deemed it too risky. This was over
          10 years ago, before I could ask social media – and even if I
          had been able to ask, I doubt many examples would have been
          available. Maybe not any. So I have drawn together the
          examples in this blog post in case any doctoral student feels
          creative but needs some evidence of precedent to comfort a
          nervous supervisor. <br>
