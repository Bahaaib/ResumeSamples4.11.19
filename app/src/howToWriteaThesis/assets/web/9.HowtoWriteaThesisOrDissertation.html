    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">There are
            many articles online that claim to explain how to
            successfully write a thesis or dissertation. Most of them
            are completely useless! This article has been written by a
            published academic who has helped hundreds of students to
            successfully write their thesis or dissertation. Find out
            how!</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">1. Choose a
            Topic</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The first
            step is to choose a broad topic for your thesis. For
            example, if you are undertaking a PhD in History, the topic
            might be as broad as women's involvement in the Spanish
            Civil War. You will refine and narrow this topic at a later
            stage. Choosing the topic for your thesis is an important
            step that requires a great deal of thoughtful consideration.
            Many factors need to be considered. Ask yourself these
            questions:</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">What topic in
            my field interests me the most?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you are
            writing an Honours thesis, you will need to maintain your
            interest in the topic you choose for at least one year. If
            you are completing a PhD, you will be researching this topic
            for three or more years! For this reason, it is important
            that you choose a topic that will hold your enthusiasm,
            interest and passion for an extended period. There is
            nothing worse than being locked in to studying a thesis
            topic that no longer interests you.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Will I be
            able to find an appropriate supervisor for that topic?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Finding a
            supervisor is an important step in your postgraduate journey
            and it is something you need to consider when choosing your
            topic. There needs to be a balance between your interest in
            a topic and the ability of a specific supervisor to work in
            this area. It is not useful to choose a topic that is of
            immense interest to you if no one at your university has
            sufficient knowledge in the area to act as your supervisor.
            However, it is also not advisable to choose a supervisor
            first and then choose a topic based solely on their research
            interests, as you may end up studying something that is not
            of interest to you.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Will I have
            access to the appropriate sources to research this topic?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Similarly, it
            is not useful to choose a topic that is immensely
            interesting to you if there is very little information on
            the subject. When choosing your topic, consider what types
            of sources you would need to be able to research it well,
            and find out if you will have access to these sources. If,
            as in the example above, you will be studying the Spanish
            Civil War, can you speak Spanish? Will you be able to travel
            to Spain to access sources? Does a wealth of material on
            your chosen subject exist?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">2. Conduct
            the Literature Review</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Once you have
            chosen a topic to study for your thesis, you need to begin
            your background research to discover what has already been
            written on the topic by other researchers. There are several
            reasons why it is important to conduct a thorough Literature
            Review:</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Most thesis
            structures require you to include a well written Literature
            Review in your thesis, so that you can demonstrate you have
            conducted in-depth research in the field and possess a sound
            knowledge of it</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">You need to
            study what has been written on a topic so you can identify a
            gap in the current literature that can be filled by your
            thesis, since a thesis needs to make an original
            contribution to a field of knowledge</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">3. Narrow
            your Topic and Define your Research Questions</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Once you have
            conducted your Literature Review and identified a gap in the
            current field of knowledge in your topic, you will be able
            to narrow your topic further. This is an important step as
            this is the point at which you will decide what questions
            your thesis will answer.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In the
            example of the PhD student who knew she wanted to study
            women's involvement in the Spanish Civil War, after a
            careful review of the literature she might have found that
            one unexamined area is the role of Republican women in
            combat during the war. This is a much narrower topic than
            'women's involvement in the Spanish Civil War', and thus it
            is a suitable subject for a thesis. The student would then
            need to define her research questions. Her main research
            question might be 'Why was the military participation of
            Republican women in the Spanish Civil War significant?' In
            order to answer this main research question, she would first
            have to answer a set of sub-questions, like these:</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">How many
            women fought in the Spanish Civil War? <br>
            What motivated these women to volunteer for combat? <br>
            Why were these women removed from their combat positions
            only eight months after the beginning of the war?</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Thus, the
            third step in writing a thesis is narrowing your topic,
            deciding on a main research question and deciding on
            sub-questions.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">4. Research
            Proposal</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If you are
            writing a Masters or a PhD thesis, you will normally be
            required to write a detailed Research Proposal in the first
            few months of your candidature. If you are undertaking a
            PhD, for example, you might have six months to write a
            10,000 word proposal. This Research Proposal will include
            information you have discovered in your Literature Review,
            and will outline what your thesis aims to achieve. For many
            students, this Research Proposal later becomes the basis for
            the Introduction and Literature Review in their final
            thesis. The successful completion of this proposal and its
            acceptance by your university is a necessary step in order
            to continue your candidature. Once you have written your
            Research Proposal, it is important that you have it
            professionally edited prior to submitting it, to ensure you
            have the best chance of its acceptance. See 'The Final
            Stage: Professional Editing' below.</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">5. Conduct
            the Research</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The aim in
            conducting your research is to answer your research
            questions and develop a thesis statement. The thesis
            statement is your answer to your main research question. It
            defines the argument that you will be putting forward
            throughout your thesis. In fact, the word 'thesis' means
            'argument' or 'position'.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Conducting
            the research is the most important and time-consuming stage
            of writing a thesis. How you do this will depend on your
            field of study and the research project you have created. It
            is important to consult with your supervisor throughout this
            stage and to use time management skills to ensure that you
            stay on track.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">6. Follow the
            Guidelines</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Your
            university department or school will have guidelines that
            you must follow when writing your thesis and it is important
            to be familiar with these before you begin writing your
            first draft. These guidelines will vary from university to
            university. They even vary within universities, as different
            disciplines follow different guidelines. It is important
            that you check with your supervisor about where to find the
            correct guidelines to follow. Often these guidelines will be
            very detailed and will specify the following things: the
            length of your final thesis; the structure of the thesis and
            what elements it should contain; the referencing style to be
            used; and the formatting and presentation of the thesis. If
            you have trouble following some of the guidelines, for
            example the formatting and presentation or the correct
            referencing of your thesis, your professional editor will be
            able to assist you in these matters (please see 'The Final
            Stage: Professional Editing').</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">7. Write the
            First Draft of the Thesis</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Once you have
            completed your research, you will arrive at what can be the
            most nerve-racking stage, writing up your results in the
            form of your first draft. Before you begin writing, it is
            important that you finalise a detailed plan for your thesis
            (one that you no doubt will have begun developing during the
            research stage). With a detailed plan and organised
            research, you will not feel like you are starting from
            scratch when you begin writing your first draft. Your
            professional editor at Elite Editing &amp; Tutoring can help
            you during this stage, as some students find it helpful to
            submit individual chapters for editing as soon as they have
            written them. This is especially helpful for students who
            have English as a second language. This way you are able to
            submit drafts to your supervisor that have already been
            edited to improve the level of English and your supervisor
            can concentrate on advising you regarding the ideas and
            arguments contained in your thesis, rather than being
            distracted by the language use.</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">8. Thesis
            Structure</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"> </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The structure
            of a thesis varies widely. It will depend on what level you
            are studying at, what field you are studying in, the
            guidelines you are following, your supervisor's suggestions,
            and how best to present the type of research you have done.
            Below is an example of a common thesis structure. This is a
            guide only and you will need to adjust it to suit your needs
            and adhere to your department's guidelines.</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Once you have
            completed writing your thesis, it is vital that you have it
            professionally edited by an academic editor. You have just
            spent between a year (for Honours students) and over three
            years (for PhD students) doing your research and writing up
            your results. After all this effort, it is critical that
            your work is presented in the best possible way. Using a
            professional academic editor will ensure that your work is
            polished, well written, and presented correctly. If English
            is your second language, having your thesis professionally
            edited is even more important. You do not want mistakes in
            your writing to confuse your examiners or distract them from
            the important arguments you are making.</font></big></big></p>
