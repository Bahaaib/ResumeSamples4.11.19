          Is the Traditional Resume Enough to Land the Job You Really
          Want?<br>
          <br>
          For $200 any person, weak in writing skills, or otherwise, can
          get professional assistance to prepare their resume for a job
          search. Unfortunately this tweaking of a person's background
          for presentation to an employer is usually cosmetic at best.
          It looks good; the grammar is sound, the arrangement is
          attractive and the information is correct but is that enough
          to land the job?<br>

          A well-written resume can enhance your prospects. And
          introducing all the facts can provide the reader with accurate
          information. But they are not enough--not by a long shot. This
          form of tweaking reminds us of our oft-quoted expression that
          no matter how much you tweak a submarine, it will never be
          able to fly. Why? It is because you are working from an
          improbable or even wrong basis.<br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>What does an Employer Want?</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          What does an employer want? Employers are in a hurry so the
          first lines of a resume should quickly focus on their job
          needs. At that point, if the resume is done correctly, the
          employer will immediately see a fit or non-fit and, thus, no
          further time will be wasted by the employer (or the
          applicant). Assuming a fit, then the employer wants
          information of the ability to meet that need. The resume
          should provide that verification, accurately and concisely.
          Now, with the employer's interest piqued, the resume should
          tell the employer about who you are; your real personality as
          evidenced by your brief, factual life story. The employer
          should be able to understand the character of the
          individual--honest, determined, and easy-going--whatever is
          true of you. Finally the resume will illustrate what
          traditional resumes provide;a list of your past job
          experiences and training. Notice that the last item of this
          ideal resume is the information that traditional resumes put
          first. So, we are different already.<br>
          <br>
          How do we create this special resume (your life story) in the
          right order, in a way that is not too long, but says enough?
          Well, the not-too-long part is easy: 2 pages of 12-point type
          no less, no more. But an explanation of the 'enough part'
          takes a lot more time to outline.<br>
          <br>
          It is as follows:<br>
          <br>
          What is enough?<br>
          <br>
          A proper resume, besides having a professional appearance and
          length should:<br>
          <br>

              attention</font></big></big></li>

              the reader to become progressively more involved.</font></big></big></li>
      <li><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Reflect
              not only the skills of the individual but also make the

              exaggerations or ambiguities</font></big></big></li>

              an easy fit between the job need and applicant's skills</font></big></big></li>
      <li><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Allow for
              a positive rejection (a bad job fit serves no one's

              adjust to the specific job description</font></big></big></li>
    </ul>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">If that is done,
          hiring managers will be salivating when reading the resume.
          When the manager invites this person in for an interview it is
          because the manager has already decided that "this is the
          person we want." The interview will only serve as a
          confirmation.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">A Compelling Story</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          A compelling story is told by having the right sequence of
          events which constantly reinforces the wants of the reader,
          until by the end of the story, the reader is compelled to take
          action to hire you because you fit the immediate need. And the
          story is complete; it's all there for the reader to see. The
          hiring interview becomes a formality of a decision already
          made when reading the life story projected by this resume.<br>
          <br>

    <div align="center"><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
            sans-serif"><b>Grab Immediate Attention</b></font></big></big><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          The only way to grab the reader's attention is to say
          something of interest to a reader. What is of interest to a
          reader of resumes? It is what you do and if it fits what the
          reader wants, then attention will be riveted on your resume
          and will continue there until something off-base shows up. So
          you must state the job you want, clearly enough that any
          reader understands it and understands if it fits an immediate
          (and, usually, pain-inducing) requirement.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Sequence the Reader</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          You sequence the reader by putting the reader's interests
          first, not your own. Think of how a book is sold in a
          bookshop. First the title grabs the observer (your job
          objective). Then the jacket of the book summarizes relevant
          highlights within the book (your brief factual, relevant
          highlights). Next, as a potential book buyer, you flip through
          the book to check certain contents or the writing style to get
          to know something about how this author goes about writing of
          the topic of your interest (factual, understated
          accomplishments in the resume). Now you buy the book and after
          you read it, you look at the appendices (for us that is your
          past job history not nearly as important as you might think
          for the first pass, but essential as backup information hence
          at the back of the resume).<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Let the Personality Shine Through</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          At this point in our story, the reader of your resume already
          has determined that your skills fit the requirement. "But who
          is this person really?" asks the employer. Although it is not
          easy, you must project to the reader who you really are.
          Obviously a list of your past jobs and degrees won't cut it.
          Therefore you have to, in a subtle way, weave your values,
          your likes and dislikes, your strengths and your weaknesses
          into the story. Although this is difficult to do, it is
          absolutely essential because it is from that information that
          the employer will judge a match to the company or that
          individual hiring manager's value system. For example, if the
          employer values high ethical behavior and your resume projects
          high ethical behavior, there will be an empathetic and
          emotional reaction to your personality. Since most decisions,
          including hiring decisions, are emotionally based (with the
          logical rationale following after) you have to appeal to the
          employer's emotion. This can work either way. If the employer
          thinks that people with high ethical values are wimps, that
          employer will not react positively to your resume. And, just
          as well; you wouldn't be happy there anyway.<br>
          <br>
        </font></big></big>
    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Avoid Ambiguities</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Another difficult but essential chore in the resume
          preparation is to state matters in a factual way so that the
          reader has no doubt of the veracity of the statement. Instead
          of writing "Improved efficiency considerably", you must be
          specific: "Increased production from 10 parts per hour to 22
          parts per hour, adding $2.5 million production output per year
          to the company". Never exaggerate in your resume, directly or
          by implication. "Oversaw a team of professionals" should
          become: "oversaw 2 engineers and one technician". "Oversaw
          dozens of workers" should read: "oversaw 22 workers" if 22 is
          the maximum number that you can be certain that reported to
          you.<br>
          <br>

    <div align="center"><b><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial,
              sans-serif">Ensuring the Fit</font></big></big></b><br>
    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          The only way to make sure that you fit the job requirement is
          to:<br>
          <br>
          (a) make a distinct resume for every job to which you apply
          tailored to the needs of the potential job and<br>
          <br>
          (b) go through the job specification, word-by-word and
          demonstrate how you match (or don't match) each word or
          phrase.<br>
          <br>
          This unique style of cover letter will ensure the fit between
          the employer and you.<br>
          <br>
          To make this adaptable-resume approach practical, your resume
          needs to be formatted in such a way with reserve clauses you
          can draw on in an instant, in order to tailor it to the
          varying job needs before you but only when needed. Strong
          reserve forces will win the battle of the day, as well as the
          job of the day<br>

    </div>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
          Preparing a resume is not an easy task and it should never be
          viewed as one or as a necessary evil. It should instead be
          seen as a crucial life story; your life story.<br>
          <br>
          It has to be done in a way that the reader, upon completing
          the perusal of the life story, knows who you are and can
          decide there and then if you are the right kind of person for
          that company;skill wise and personality wise.<br>
