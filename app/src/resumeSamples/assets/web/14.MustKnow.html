          It is normal for every person to strive for career advancement
          and growth. It makes them feel that all of their hard work has
          paid off and that a promotion is, indeed, the best reward they
          can get.<br>
          <br>
          However, for some whose luck seems to be so illusive, they
          have to find their own growth somewhere else. That is why most
          of them opted for executive job searches, where they hope that
          someday they would be lucky enough to find the executive job
          that they have long been dreaming for.<br>
          <br>
          But is it really just luck? Or are there some factors that
          need to be considered when searching for that executive job of
          their dreams?<br>
          <br>
          Landing a good executive job is not dependent on luck. For
          people who wish to learn some tips regarding executive job
          searches, here are some pointers on how to get that dream job:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>1. Killer looks</b><br>
          <br>
          The saying, “Looks could kill” is not an understatement.
          Though the word kill is only used literally and the word look
          is sometimes associated with stares. But what is being pointed
          out here is that looks can definitely kill a person’s chances
          on landing his or her executive job if the applicant had
          missed one great factor: appearance.<br>
          <br>
          As the saying goes, first impressions last, so it would be
          better to make that first impression by looking just right for
          the job. After all, if a person wants to have an executive
          job, then, he should dress appropriately for the position. In
          this way, the executive job he had been searching for might
          just become a reality.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Show some mastery</b><br>
          <br>
          For an executive position, most employers would want to hire
          those who are already an expert in their own field. This means
          that the applicants should be adept in the areas concerning
          their chosen careers. This will show that the applicant has
          already started a coherent career track and is already
          knowledgeable in the field.<br>
          <br>
          It will do no good to an applicant who claims to be a “jack of
          all trades but a master of none.” Six out of 10 applicants are
          hired because of their expertise on a certain field. This only
          means that employers are more concerned with people who have
          already mastered their career and have established continuous
          career growth.<br>
          <br>
          Finding an available executive job could be one thing but
          actually getting that dream executive job is another thing.
          Looking and acting the part is a must to landing that dream
          job!<br>
