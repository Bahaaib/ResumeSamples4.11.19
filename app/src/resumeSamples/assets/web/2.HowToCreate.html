    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          first step to
          writing an exceptional resume, is to do some research about
          the company
          that you are applying to and carefully read through the job
          description. Pay special attention to the job skills that they
          are
          looking for. Make a mental note as to whether you have the
          skills and
          qualities mentioned in the job description. Do you have enough
          experience in the appropriate areas to make you an easy choice
          for
          hiring?</big></big></p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>After
          you have a
          pretty good idea of what the company is looking for, you can
          do a
          contemplative exercise that will aid you in matching your
          background
          and proficiencies with the job description and necessary skill
          set.
          Write one job responsibility or job description at the top of
          a page,
          then start thinking about experiences and/or accomplishments
          that you
          have had that relate to that qualification. For instance:</big></big></p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>During
          the
          contemplative exercise, it's not important to phrase
          everything
          perfectly. The goal of this exercise is to get the thoughts
          flowing on
          how to tailor your resume to be the perfect fit for the job
          opening.
          This information will serve as the raw material for your
          manicured
          resume. Don't forget, it is always acceptable to use
          experiences from
          volunteer or extracurricular activities in your resume, too.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Recruiters
          are
          looking to hire someone that they know can handle the
          responsibilities
          and job requirements of the position that they are hiring for.
          By
          utilizing the planning stage, you can make sure that your
          resume is
          tailored specifically to the job that you want. If your resume
          does not
          reflect the main qualifications that the company is looking
          for, it
          will not even get a second look by a recruiter.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><b><big><big>2.
            Keep it short
            and sweet</big></big></b></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>A
          shorter resume is
          far better than a really lengthy resume. This is the problem:
          You have
          a lot of information to share, but recruiters don't have the
          time to
          hear it. If a resume is too long, it is very likely that the
          recruiter
          will not even bother to read the whole resume before moving on
          to the
          next one.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>A
          resume does not
          need to tell your entire life story. It is meant to be a way
          to share
          enough information about your work experience and background
          to get you
          hired. You don't have to, and shouldn't tell them EVERYTHING.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Think
          about it like
          a printed advertisement in a magazine or a billboard. The ad
          tells you
          the basics, like for Dawn dish detergent, "it's tough on
          grease but
          easy on your hands". The advertisements don't tell you when
          Dawn was
          created, the different colors or fragrances that it comes in,
          all of
          the stores where Dawn can be purchased, etc. The ad is
          abbreviated and
          to the point, only sharing the vital information for the
          situation,
          space, and time they have to catch your attention.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>This
          is exactly
          what your resume should do. You may have a lot of
          accomplishments, but
          there is only a limited amount of time to present your message
          to a
          recruiter. Decide what you want a recruiter to see and know
          about you
          in their fifteen-second scan. Typically, this means that you
          should
          focus your emphasis on your most recent and relevant
          experiences.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If you
          have fifteen
          to twenty years of work experience, the recruiter probably
          doesn't need
          to know all of the details of your assistant manager retail
          job during
          college. If one of your past jobs is completely irrelevant to
          the job
          that you are applying for, it is not necessary to include any
          bullet
          points under the title and position. It is not a rule that you
          are
          required to share every detail of every job that you have ever
          had.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>For
          more mature job
          seekers, you will want to focus the vast majority of your
          resume to the
          last ten to fifteen years, unless there is extremely relevant
          experience that goes further back. The older jobs should still
          appear
          on your resume, they should just not contain any bullet
          points.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Students
          and recent
          graduates should think of their resume as a rolling four-year
          document.
          That means that seniors in college should not list work
          history from
          high school. If you have been working full-time for two years,
          you will
          only want to include college internships from junior and
          senior years.
          Of course, the exception to this rule would be very relevant
          work
          history that goes longer than four years back.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Do not
          write your
          resume in complete sentences. Recruiters like to see an
          outline format,
          using bullet points that quickly and concisely show your work
          history.
          It is key to keep in mind that recruiters are typically
          reviewing
          hundreds of resumes, at one time. They are scanning to see if
          your
          resume deserves more than the initial fifteen-second glance.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>First
          person and
          third person perspectives should never be used in writing a
          resume.
          Also, complete, full sentences make the resume seem lengthy,
          cluttered,
          and overwhelming. Every bullet point in your list of
          experiences should
          start with an action verb, and every verb should be different.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Wrong
          way: I was in
          charge of a charity event for my child's elementary school
          attended by
          600 people that was so successful that we raised $10,000.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Right
          way:
          Orchestrated elementary school charity event attended by 600
          people,
          raising $10,000.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Clearly
          the second
          one (the right way) is not only easier to read, but also
          sounds more
          powerful with the first word being an action verb. The second
          example
          is much more likely to stand out to the recruiter's quick
          resume scan.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>A
          resume should
          never be more than two pages long. However, a curriculum vitae
          or CV is
          almost always longer than 2 pages. Curriculum vitae are really
          only
          used when applying for scientific or academic positions, when
          all
          presentations, publications, and course work have to be
          listed.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>For a
          resume, this
          is a good rule to follow: If you have for four years or less,
          your
          resume should only consist of one-page. After you have passed
          the four
          years of experience, it is acceptable, but no necessary to
          scale up to
          a two-page resume. Always remember, short and succinct writing
          is more
          powerful than long, explanatory prose.</big></big></p>

      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          biggest mistake
          made by a very large percentage of job seekers is using their
          resume as
          a list of job descriptions. Basically, the mistake is in not
          describing
          what they did specifically in that job, but explaining what
          any person
          would have done in that position. This is an example to
          illustrate the
          point:</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Sales

    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Now,
          you may not
          see anything wrong with this. Unfortunately, every sales
          representative
          in the history of any company does the exact same things. You
          want to
          stand out, and that list of job requirements for a sales rep.
          does not
          do the trick.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          key to creating
          an exceptional resume is to focus on what you in particular
          accomplished. What did you do in that job that was special,
          different,
          or unique? What made you distinctive?</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>The
          easiest way to
          do this is by thinking about successes that you have had.
          Successes
          come in two forms: extent and outcome.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Extent</big></big></p>
    <big><big>

          often?<br>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Outcome</big></big></p>
    <big><big>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>* Were
          you

          * Did you create something new?</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>As you
          can likely
          tell from these questions, you get successes through data,
          numbers, and
          tangible information. You need to be as specific as possible
          in
          everything that you write.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Let's
          take a look
          at the right way to have written the last sample. All of the
          information is based on the same person, with the same job,
          but a whole
          lot better resume:</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Sales
          Representative, No Name, LLC, State College, PA, 2008-Present</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>* Sold
          $10 million

          * Ranked first out of 50 national sales representatives<br>
          * Personally secured more than 300 new customers through
          dedicated
          cold-calling and on-site visits</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>This
          sounds a lot
          better, because this resume focuses on this sales
          representative's
          personal successes and achievements in his former job.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>It is
          good to pay
          yourself accolades for you achievements. A job search is not
          the place
          to be modest or downplay your successes. If you are not going
          to show
          off your own achievements, no one will. It is important to not
          come
          across as arrogant, but you should present yourself as
          confident and
          self-assurance in your abilities. If you worked with highly
          visible
          clients or big-name accounts, list the names on your resume.

          the big-names on your resume is likely to catch the
          recruiter's
          attention, and cause a more thorough evaluation of your
          resume.</big></big></p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Keep
          notes about
          your job achievements. In a best case scenario, you would
          update your
          resume once every six months, or even more often. No one
          actually does
          that, especially if they think they are comfortable in their
          jobs. It
          is difficult to remember your success stories, when they
          happened, or
          the circumstances they happened under, if years go by without
          updating
          your resume.</big></big></p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>When
          the next job
          offer comes along, you really will want to have your resume
          ready. You
          never know when you could hear about an opportunity to work at
          your
          dream job. If you have to spend a large amount of time
          updating your
          resume, you could miss your opportunity.</big></big></p>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If you
          don't want
          to update your resume frequently, you need to keep notes on
          your
          duties, projects, and accomplishments -- with special
          attention to the
          numbers. That way, when you need to update your resume or make
          a job
          change, you will have your notes for reference, so your resume
          can be
          updated quickly.<br>
