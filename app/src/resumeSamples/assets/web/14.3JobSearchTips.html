          1) Approach finding a job as if it were a full-time job,
          because it is. If you had a job, you would report to work at
          the same time each day (like 8 am), take an hour (or less) for
          lunch, and quit at the same time each day (like 5 pm). You
          would work five days every week. And you would work hard to
          accomplish as much as you could because your career depended
          upon it.<br>
          <br>
          When you are searching for a job, you should follow the same
          type of schedule because your future depends upon it.<br>
          <br>
          Treating your job search like a part-time hobby guarantees
          that it will take longer.<br>
          <br>
          So, begin tomorrow by reporting to work and spending the day
          on tasks that lead to a job.<br>
          <br>
          2) Approach finding a job as if it were a project. That means
          you should set goals for yourself, make plans, and monitor
          your progress. You should apply all of the tools and skills
          that you used in your last job to the project of finding your
          next job.<br>
          <br>
          As you must expect, this is an important project. The sooner
          you complete it, the sooner you gain a promotion into a job.<br>
          <br>
          3) Be your own boss. Set expectations for what you need to
          accomplish, provide direction, and monitor your work.<br>
          <br>
          Meet with yourself once each week to evaluate your
          performance. I recommend doing this by writing two reports.
          The first is a candid evaluation of what you accomplished
          during the previous week. The second is a description of your
          plans for the coming week. Your plans should include your
          goals, actions, and priorities.<br>
          <br>
          The first time that you write these reports, write an
          evaluation of what you have done so far. Describe the results
          that this effort has produced. And compare these results with
          what you wanted to have.<br>
          <br>
          Next, map out a realistic plan for the next week based on
          achievable goals. For example, you could set goals for the
          number of people you will call, the number of networking
          meetings you will attend, and the research you will conduct.<br>
          <br>
          In the coming weeks, compare the results that you obtained
          during the previous week with the goals that you set. For
          example, if you planned to attend twelve networking meetings
          and you attended only two, you should a) explain why this
          happened and b) plan actions that will correct such a
          difference. <br>
          <br>
          You should also analyze why you missed your goal because this
          provides insights on what you need to do differently. For
          example, Your goal (e.g., of attending twelve networking
          meetings) may have been set too high. Or maybe there are
          things you can do that will make it easier to achieve your job
          search goals, such as car pooling with a friend who is also
          looking for a job.<br>
          <br>
          Finding a job is a full time job. Work through it with a plan
          and the support of a good boss (yourself).<br>
