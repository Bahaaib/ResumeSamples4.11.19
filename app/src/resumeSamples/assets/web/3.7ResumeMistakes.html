    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The average
            time an
            initial resume screener (recruiter, HR rep, hiring manager
            or someone
            else) looks at your resume the first time is less than 15
            seconds. It's
            true. Look it up. Some say it's as little as 10 seconds.
            Mind you, this
            is only the amount of time they spend looking at it to
            decide if they
            want to look at it further and in more detail. In other
            words, you
            have, on average, 10 - 15 seconds to get the attention of
            the screener.</font></big></big></p>

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Some things
            you
            can't control. If you applied to a position you clearly
            aren't
            qualified for (like a Controller position when your
            experience is all
            Wed Development) then there is nothing you can do. You just
            wasted your
            time applying and 10 - 15 seconds of the screener's life.
            Don't do
            this. It's just irritating. But there are things you can
            avoid when
            writing your resume that will help keep you in the "read
            further" pile.

    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Many of the
            mistakes candidates make are based on outdated thinking.
            Other mistakes
            are just poor judgment or a lack of understanding of how to
            put
            together a resume. If you're applying to jobs that you think
            you're
            qualified for but getting no responses then it's probably
            time to
            revisit your resume and perhaps look to hire a professional
            resume
            writing service. But let's see if you can avoid that with
            these tips.</font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">1) Your
            Objective<br>
            Often people include an objective on their resume. Sometimes
            it's a
            very bland, generic objective that either says you have no
            ambition or
            is a waste of space. Other times it's specific, but not
            relevant to the
            job you're applying for. You say something like "Seeking a
            position
            where I can utilize my extensive management
            experience‚EUR¶". But the position doesn't supervise
            anyone. Even though you're okay with this you've already
            knocked
            yourself out. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Solution:
            Skip the
            Objective. There is no real reason to include one. It adds
            no value to
            your resume and can only hurt you. Instead, lead off with a
            "Summary"
            of qualifications and experience. Make a bullet list of your
            skills and
            accomplishments. If you really must include an Objective out
            of some
            deep seeded need then make sure you cater it to each job you
            apply to. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">2) Poor
            Layout /
            Organization<br>
            You want to keep your resume to one or two pages and cram
            everything
            in. You make it one, long winded paragraph without any
            breaks. It's so
            crammed it's basically unreadable. If a screener can't
            easily see your
            relevant experience then they aren't going to waste their
            time reading
            your resume. Don't make them dig for the information. Lay
            your resume
            out in a professional manner. Make sure your previous
            employers and
            positions are clearly identified with space breaks between
            the end of
            one job and the start of the next. Also, use bullet points
            as much as
            possible to identify your skills and experience. They are
            easier to
            read than a long winded paragraph. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Also, if you
            are a
            recent graduate with little experience then your Education
            is key and
            should be listed at the start of your resume (after the
            summary). If
            you have a few years' experience then move the Education to
            the bottom
            of your resume, after your experience. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">3) Including
            Too
            Much Information<br>
            If you have previous experience, great. But you don't need
            to go all
            the way back to the stone ages. Make sure you include at
            least the last
            10 years and up to 15. If you want to include experience
            further than
            that keep it short. List the companies you worked, the
            position you
            held and time frame. Other than that is it really relevant
            to the
            current position your applying to? A resume can be longer
            than one page
            (and should be if you have a few years' experience and more
            than one
            job). But you don't want to kill more trees than necessary.
            Try and
            keep the resume to 3 pages. If you're a technical person
            with lots of
            listed skills or publications these should be listed at the
            end of the
            resume and not counted against the "3 page" recommendation.
          </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Also, if you
            are
            now a professional with at least 2 or 3 years' experience
            then lose the
            jobs you held while in school. No one cares if you were a
            sales clerk
            at Macy's if your applying as a Senior Accountant. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">4) Skipping
            Jobs
            you've held with one Company (Promotions)<br>
            You list only you're last position held with a previous or
            current
            employer even though you were with them for several years
            and earned
            promotions. This will cause the screener to think you didn't
            progress
            at all in your job. Why would that be? If you held several
            positions
            then include them separately. Indicate you were promoted to
            the next
            position you held. You don't need to list the company
            multiple times,
            but make it clear the positions were all with the same
            employer. I've
            seen many resumes discounted before because it looked like
            the
            candidate was a major job hopper when in fact they were
            stable and
            progressing. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">5) Resume
            Format<br>
            The functional format is a format some candidate use for
            their resume.
            Don't. While it does list all your skills and accreditations
            in a nice
            and clear format, it can be confusing and doesn't tie your
            experience
            with when and where you got it. Use a reverse chronological
            resume
            format. Start with your most recent employer and work
            backwards.
            Include the skills you learned/used at each position. This
            format is
            much easier to read and identify where you obtained your
            experience
            which will get the attention of the screener. Remember, you
            need them
            to want to continue reading your resume. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">6) Keywords<br>
            You right your resume in a very simple, easy flowing way.
            You try and
            keep it short and write it without regard to the critical
            components of
            the job you're applying too. This could be fine but is
            becoming more
            and more dangerous. More and more companies are using
            automated
            programs to screen through the resumes they receive to
            identify
            potential candidates for human review. The key to getting
            past this and
            having your resume seen by a human is Keywords. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">Review the
            job
            description for the job you're applying to carefully and
            make sure you
            include those keywords they are looking to identify. And
            make sure you
            put them in similar order, spelling and case that the
            description has.
            In other words, if the company requires "jQuery" then list
            it that way
            on your resume. If they are looking for "jquery" then use
            the lower
            case "q". Be careful, however. You don't want to clutter
            your resume
            with too many repeated keywords. </font></big></big></p>
    <big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
        </font></big></big>
    <p><big><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">7) Lack of
            Professionalism<br>

            or <a href="mailto:ilikeithot@emaildomain.com">ilikeithot@emaildomain.com</a>.
            Great for you. Your friends all know it. But you don't want
            those to
            identify you to a prospective employer. Get a simple, more
            professional
            email address. You can use Gmail, Yahoo or any number of
            other free
            email service providers. Just make it professional (use your
            name if
            possible; add a number to it if your name isn't available as
            is). </font></big></big></p>
