            Your Resume Be?</span><br>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>One of
          the most
          common questions I receive from job seekers is about their
          resume
          format - specifically, how long their resume should be. How
          many pages
          a resume should be really depends on how long you have been in
          the work
          force and how much experience you have. And, it also depends
          on the
          personal preferences of the recruiter into whose hands your
          resume
          falls.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>There
          are a lot of
          recruiters out there who insist that a proper resume format
          should
          include no more than one page. There are other recruiters who
          insist
          that a resume should be at least two pages, but no more than
          that. What
          is even more frustrating is that there are
          newspaper/internet/website
          articles (take your pick) who all have conflicting advice on
          them as
          well.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>So,
          what is a job
          seeker to do? The most important resume format issue to
          address is to
          have some essential information in your resume, touch upon the
          key
          points, but try to keep it to two to three pages initially.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Here
          are my Top 5
          items that I look for in
          someones resume format:</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>1)
          Above the Fold
          criteria - Above the fold is a newspaper term that refers to
          the top
          page of the newspaper that everyone reads first. You
          cant always guarantee that
          people will get to the bottom of the page, so you put your
          best foot
          forward on that top half. It is the same with resumes.
          The&nbsp;?Above
          the
          Fold for resumes is everything
          that you can see on your computer screen without having to
          scroll down.
          This area should have Job Titles in which you envision
          yourself, a list
          of 5-10 bullets that very concisely sum up whatever you do
          best, and a
          list of 12-16 keyword skills you possess. In a proper resume
          format,
          Education, Certifications, and Job History should never be
          listed here.
          They belong at the bottom of your resume, and Job History
          belongs below
          the fold after youve listed
          these other key items.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>2)
          Consistent
          Working History - I am looking primarily for gaps in work
          history as I
          scan through your resume the first time. Have you job hopped a
          lot? Are
          there periods of time where you were not employed? There
          should reasons
          listed here for those gaps. Do not leave these out in order to
          keep
          your resume format less than two pages. I believe you should
          have the
          past ten years of working history listed on your resume. This
          should
          take up about half a page to a page and a half. If experience
          older
          than ten years is relevant for the job for which you are
          applying, you
          are better off condensing what you write for each job as far
          as
          accomplishments go, and putting in more work history. If the
          last ten
          years is the most relevant for this job (and that is the case
          for most
          people), place the following phrase at the bottom of your work
          history
          -</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>Prior
          Working
          History Available
          Upon Request. If you get a
          request for this information, then you will give them the rest
          of your
          working history in a separate resume format.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>*Note:
          You should
          always have TWO resumes. You should have an abbreviated resume
          and a
          full blown resume containing all work history. The full blown
          resume
          can be up to 4-5 pages, but I
          wouldnt recommend going over
          that because nobody will read past 4 or 5 pages anyway.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>3)
          Grammar,
          Punctuation, Spelling - I am looking at your attention to
          detail, and
          for someone who reads resumes all the time, mistakes like
          these stick
          out like a sore thumb. When I see a resume format that has
          lots of
          mistakes in them, I am unimpressed. They automatically hit my
          trash
          pile. If you cant be
          conscientious enough to do a good job on your resume, you
          probably
          wont pay a lot of attention to
          details on your job either.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>4) Are
          you selling
          yourself? - I like resumes of candidates who use power verbs
          and who
          are not afraid to really sell me on how great they are. I
          dont want a description of
          what you did from day to day. I want to know specific things
          that you
          accomplished. What did you do that was a really big deal?</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>4)
          Keyword Searches
          - Finally, your resume format will not turn up in my resume
          database or
          anywhere else for that matter, if you do not have multiple
          instances of
          key things with which you have experience with listed in your
          resume.
          You should use the exact same keyword phrase here. Are you a
          Financial
          Analyst? You should have the word
          Ã¢â?¬Ë?Analyze
          or
          Ã¢â?¬Ë?Analysis
          listed in your resume at least 3 or 4 times. Are you a
          software
          developer? You should have whatever language in which you
          develop
          listed multiple times in your resume as well. This helps my
          resume
          database search engine as well as all the other recruiters who
          are
          looking for you out there find you in the first place!
          Keywords are
          essential in getting found as potential fits for jobs. So,
          make sure
          that whatever your top 12-16 skills you listed in
          your&nbsp;?Above the
          Fold section above are also
          scattered throughout your resume as well. This will help your
          search
          rankings rank much higher when recruiters are searching for
          you using
          their resume database search engines.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>5)
          Review Your
          Resume Before Submitting It! - Once you have all of this
          information
          entered, look at how many pages your resume is currently. At
          this
          point, it should be about two pages long. And make sure you
          read
          through it from top to bottom to catch any typos, grammatical,
          or
          punctuation problems. Have someone else read your resume! A
          fresh set
          of eyes will be able to catch mistakes you
          wont catch because
          youve been looking at your
          resume so long.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>If a
          resume is only
          one page, I usually chunk it in the trash automatically
          because as a
          Retained Search recruiter, I am typically only filling
          positions which
          require experienced individuals with 5 or more years of
          experience.
          Anyone who has worked this long should have at least two pages
          worth of
          information. If they dont,
          theyre not experienced enough
          for me. And, if its not that
          long, they usually havent done
          a good job at completing Tips #1, #2, and #4 above.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>I am
          not going to
          beg you to tell me about yourself, so if your resume is only
          one page,
          for me personally, it is not worth my time to review it. If it
          is over
          two pages, I am not going to penalize you for it. In fact, if
          someone
          has over ten years of experience, I
          dont even mind looking at a
          three or four page resume if it is well written.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>My
          long drawn out
          answer to the original question,&nbsp;How
          long should your resume be,
          is that the length of your resume usually depends upon the
          individual
          recruiter personal
          preferences. You can't go wrong
          with a two page resume, and even a three or four page resume
          is not
          going to hurt you if you have fifteen or more years of
          experience. But,
          try not to go too far past three pages.</big></big></p>
    <big><big>
      </big></big>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big><big>My
          advice is not to
          sweat the length of your resume so much, and get more focused
          on the
          layout, resume format, and actual content of the resume
          itself.</big></big></p>
