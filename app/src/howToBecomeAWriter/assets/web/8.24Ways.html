          1.&nbsp; Don’t set yourself a writing routine or stick to it.<br>
          <br>
          2.&nbsp; Always make sure that doing your writing is at the
          bottom of
          your list of priorities, and even when you are writing, if
          something
          else you have to do that day springs to mind, then go and do
          that
          instead.<br>
          <br>
          3.&nbsp; If one of your friends comes round to invite you out
          for
          coffee, just go, no matter how busy you are with your writing.<br>
          <br>
          4.&nbsp; Whenever you’re writing, answer the phone every time
          it
          rings and answer the door every time someone knocks.<br>
          <br>
          5.&nbsp; Always feel guilty for doing your writing instead of
          doing
          what other people want you to do.<br>
          <br>
          6.&nbsp; Don’t read any articles about writing, especially if
          it’s written by an expert.<br>
          <br>
          7.&nbsp; If anyone ever tells you of a simple and profitable
          way to
          make money from your writing, don’t believe them and never try
          it.<br>
          <br>
          8.&nbsp; Never take a writing course to hone your skills.<br>
          <br>
          9.&nbsp; Don’t visit any writing sites on the internet, and
          never
          subscribe to their newsletters.<br>
          <br>
          10. Don’t join any writer’s forums or participate in any
          online discussions.<br>
          <br>
          11. Don’t get your own website to showcase your writing
          ability
          and writing services to the whole world.<br>
          <br>
          12. Do everything you possibly can not to get your name known
          in the
          writing world.<br>
          <br>
          13. Keep your work secret.&nbsp; Always put your writing away
          in a draw
          when you’ve finished and never show it to anyone –
          especially editors and publishers.<br>
          <br>
          14. Don’t enter writing competitions.<br>
          <br>
          15. Don’t submit articles to paying websites.<br>
          <br>
          16. Never even think about writing a book.<br>
          <br>
          17. Especially don’t consider writing a profitable e-book.<br>
          <br>
          18. They say you should write at least 5 article proposals or
          short
          stories every week.&nbsp; If you do write them, don’t mail
          them.<br>
          <br>
          19. If a magazine or publisher offers specific guidelines for
          submissions, don’t follow them.<br>
          <br>
          20. If an editor likes your work and publishes it, never offer
          to write
          for them again.<br>
          <br>
          21. If you send in a query to an editor and don’t hear
          anything
          for a couple of weeks, start ringing them and don’t stop until
          they make a decision about whether or not to publish your
          work.<br>
          <br>
          22. If one publication rejects your work, assume that it’s
          worthless and unsuitable for every other publication and don’t
          send it anywhere else.<br>
          <br>
          23. Whenever you receive a rejection letter, take it
          personally and
          throw your work in the bin.<br>
          <br>
          24. Never ever consider the possibility that, if your work’s
          written from a different angle, it could be suitable for
          another market
          and sold again.<br>
