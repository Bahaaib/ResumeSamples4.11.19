          You know the secret to a long-term, and profitable, client
          relationship
          is delivering effective communication tools. But you may not
          realize
          that the impact of your writing has more to do with your skill
          as a
          writer than with your knowledge of the subject.<br>
          <br>
          And unless you help your clients understand the value of your
          skills,
          you limit your opportunities to sell those skills again and
          again.<br>
          <br>
          Every business has its own specialists, people who know more
          about
          their products and services than you'll ever know. So why
          can't they
          produce great marketing copy, clear user guides, or truly
          effective
          training for their employees and sales reps?<br>
          <br>
          Because they don't have the skills that you do, the talent for
          communicating with impact to achieve specific results. We've
          all met
          experts who "know their stuff" but can't share their knowledge
          --
          perhaps your math or physics or French teacher, or an engineer
          or
          programmer in a company you know, or even your doctor, lawyer,
          or
          insurance agent.<br>
          <br>
          At some point, a company realizes they need help
          communicating,&nbsp;
          educating prospects, customers, and their own employees about
          the
          benefits and best practices associated with their products and
          services. They go looking for outside help . . . and then they
          forget
          why!<br>
          <br>
          Your long-term success depends on reminding them of that need
          for
          communication skills. Most of these experts, whether
          clinicians or
          programmers or engineers or legal experts, are more
          comfortable talking
          to people just like themselves, rather than creative types
          like artists
          and writers.<br>
          <br>
          Left to themselves, they'll hire someone who knows a lot about
          their
          area, but perhaps writes only a little better than they do.
          And a year
          or two later, they'll be looking for someone else to help them
          when
          they realize that all the copy and training content and
          documentation
          they have churned out has produced mediocre results.<br>
          <br>
          Help yourself and help your clients.<br>
          <br>
          When you get an opportunity to talk to a prospect about
          creating
          effective communications for them, keep pushing the
          conversation toward
          the skills they need to pull it off. Make sure they understand
          their
          own need for someone different from the resources they already
          have in
          house. Help them recognize that your skills complement their
          knowledge,
          that it is that combination that produces results in the form
          of higher
          revenues, more customers, or enhanced employee performance.<br>
          <br>
          Even if you know their subject matter well, your skills are
          more
          important. After all, should their product line change, or new
          markets
          open, they may be dealing with a new body of knowledge in a
          year or two.<br>
          <br>
          But their need for effective communication will remain, and,
          if you've
          positioned yourself as the "communication expert" of their
          team, you'll
          continue to have opportunities for business from existing
          clients even
          as their business practices and markets change.<br>
