          There's nothing like writing a story. It is a truly satisfying
          creative
          process. In order to write a story that people will enjoy. You
          need to
          understand the key elements that all good writers use in
          stories. In
          this article we will explore these elements.<br>
          <br>
          1. Brainstorming<br>
          <br>
          Ask yourself these questions:<br>
          <br>
          What are you are going to write about? Who will be your
          audience? How
          much do you know about what you want to write about? What do I
          need to
          find out?<br>
          <br>
          2. Write from a Specific Point of View<br>
          <br>
          First person: "I"<br>
          <br>
          Second person: "You" (rarely used)<br>
          <br>
          Third person: "She/He" (Used the majority of time but in a
          "limited"
          way) Limited simply means that the story is told through the
          eyes of
          one particular character.<br>
          <br>
          3. Starting Your Story<br>
          <br>
          Your story should begin in such a way that it grabs the
          readers
          attention and never lets them go, some ways to begin are:
          Sound
          Effects, for example: Splash! Pop! Another way to begin is
          with
          dialogue, that is, two or more characters having a
          conversation. Using
          action is also another way to start. Whatever you choose, you
          must do
          it in a way that draws the reader in from the very beginning,
          if you
          fail to do this then no matter how good your story gets down
          the road
          it will be pointless as you have already lost your audience.<br>
          <br>
          4. Setting<br>
          <br>
          Place your characters in a setting. This is where you are to
          use
          descriptive words that let your readers see, hear and even
          smell the
          setting. The setting establishes the time and place in which
          the story
          takes place. Give your readers a snapshot view of the
          environment so
          that they can see it in their mind's eye and feel as if they
          are really
          there.<br>
          <br>
          5. Characters<br>
          <br>
          Characters are part of the life blood of fiction. Here are
          some of the
          types of characters you may want to create.<br>
          <br>
          Main Character (Protagonist): All the action revolves around
          this
          person.<br>
          <br>
          Villain (Antagonist): This person or persons oppose the main
          character
          at every turn. Villains can also become allies of the main
          character
          down the road. People change in real life as well as in
          stories.<br>
          <br>
          Friends (Sidekicks): This person or persons helps the main
          character.<br>
          <br>
          6. Conflict<br>
          <br>
          Good conflict allows your readers to become even more involved
          in the
          plot. Conflict can arise within the characters, with other
          people or
          even with nature. The needs of characters are what drives them
          into
          action. Conflict is created when obstacles are put in the way
          of the
          characters. Here are some types of conflict that can arise in
          a story:<br>
          <br>
          The main character vs. others<br>
          <br>
          The main character vs. his /her own inner self<br>
          <br>
          The main character vs. situations he/she faces in life<br>
          <br>
          The main character vs. society<br>
          <br>
          7. Dialogue<br>
          <br>
          Finally lets take a look at the purpose and use of dialogue.
          Dialogue
          is used in conversation between your characters. The
          characters may
          also have dialogue with themselves. Good dialogue tells the
          reader
          something about the characters state of mind or personality.
          Dialogue
          should be surrounded by action and move the story along. So
          make every
          conversation count!<br>
