          Writing an article doesn’t just mean putting down thoughts
          into
          words then typing and writing it. You have to capture the
          interest of
          your readers and give them a reason to keep reading. You have
          to get
          the attention of the reader and have a firm grasp of their
          interest and
          pique their curiosity. Here are five ways you can get
          creative.<br>
          <br>
          The main ingredient in writing an article is creativity. While
          creativity may come natural to many people, some of us get
          writers
          block. It can be a hair pulling ordeal just to get your
          creative juices
          flowing.<br>
          <br>
          Putting words into images in the readers mind is an art. A
          clear and
          crisp depiction requires a certain flair that only creativity
          can
          provide. Similes and metaphors help a lot, but the way an
          article gets
          entwined word for word, sentence by sentence then paragraph by
          paragraph into a whole article develops the essence of the
          article.<br>
          <br>
          So just what do you have to do when nothing comes to mind?
          That's a
          fair question but unfortunately, there's no surefire ways to
          get those
          perfect ideas to pop into your head. But, there are easy ways
          to get
          your creative juices flowing and put you into a perfect
          mindset and
          state of mind. Here are five of them.<br>
          <br>
          1) Keep a diary or a journal in your pocket or with you at all
          times.
          You just never know when an idea is triggered by something you
          may
          hear, see, or smell. Your senses are your radar in finding
          great ideas.
          Write all of them into a journal and keep it with you for
          future
          reference. You may also write down anything that you have read
          or
          heard, someone’s ideas could be used to develop your own ideas
          and this is not stealing. Remember that ideas and creativity
          can come
          from anywhere; it’s the development of the idea that makes it
          unique.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          2) Relax and take time to sort things out. You need a clear
          head. A
          jumbled mind cannot create any space for new ideas. If you are
          bothered
          by something, give yourself permission to get rid of it for
          awhile. Put
          it in the closet for a few minutes. Try closing your eyes and
          allowing
          yourself some quiet time. Block out all the sights sounds and
          smells
          around you. Turn your focus inward and breathe.<br>
          <br>
          Try to relax every time that you can and think about your
          experiences
          and interactions with others. Your experiences are what shape
          your
          mindset and your opinions which could be reflected on your
          writings.
          Try to discover yourself, find out what triggers your
          emotions.
          Discover what inspires you and what ticks you off. You can use
          these
          emotions to help you in expressing yourself and your ideas,
          with this
          you can grow creatively.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          3) Create a working place that can inspire your creativeness.<br>
          <br>
          Creativity comes from being in a good state of mind and a
          messed up
          workplace that causes distraction won’t be conducive in firing
          up
          your creative flow.<br>
          <br>
          Surround your working place with objects that makes you happy
          and
          relaxed. You may put up pictures, or scents, plants or
          anything that
          can to inspire you, relax you and get your creativeness
          cranking.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          4) Set the mood. Setting the mood requires you to just go with
          the
          moment or to induce yourself to feeling what makes your mind
          works
          best. Finding out what makes you tick could help you find ways
          to get
          your creative juices flowing. Set the pace and tempo for your
          mood and
          everything else will follow.<br>
          <br>
          There are many ways to set the mood. Some writers have been
          known to
          have a little sip of wine to stir up the imagination. Some use
          mood
          music while others let the lighting of the environment create
          the mood.
          You decide what sets your mood.<br>
          <br>
          5) Go on a vacation and just do something crazy and out of the
          norm for
          you. Letting yourself go and have fun produces adrenaline
          which can
          make your imagination run wild. If your day is usually a busy
          one, take
          an quiet adventure or a solemn hike. Whatever it is that is
          unusual
          from your daily routine can take the rut out of your schedule.<br>
          <br>
          In no time at all, your imagination will make use of that
          experience
          and get your creativeness to start working in overdrive.<br>
