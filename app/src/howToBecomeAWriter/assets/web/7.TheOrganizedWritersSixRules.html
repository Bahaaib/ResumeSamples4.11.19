          Are you trying to get organized so you have more time to
          write?&nbsp;
          Here are six rules guaranteed to make you more productive and
          more
          organized when you add them to your life.<br>
          <br>
          1. Work with Yourself, Not Against Yourself<br>
          <br>
          When you're trying to become more organized, it's tempting to
          try and
          fit into the existing organizing system of an "expert." They
          seem
          organized and they promise that if you try it, you'll be
          organized, too.<br>
          <br>
          What's more effective is to understand your personality and
          what works
          for you. There are MANY solutions and you may have to
          experiment to
          find the system that best fits the way you work--your mind,
          your body
          and the way you think. And this might be a combination of
          ideas from
          many different experts.<br>
          <br>
          Give something new a fair trial, but if after a month or so it
          feels
          awkward or counterintuitive, let it go and find something
          else!<br>
          <br>
          2. Focus and Pay Attention<br>
          <br>
          If you find that you always seem to be busy but that you never
          have
          anything to show for it, this could be the most important tip
          for you.<br>
          <br>
          When possible, do one thing at a time. Don't let your mind or
          hands
          wander to another task. Picture the finished project in your
          mind, and
          focus only on that. Get in the "zone" – you're able to be so
          much
          more effective when you're giving your whole mind, thought and
          attention.<br>
          <br>
          When we split our attention between different tasks
          ("multi-tasking"),
          most likely none of them will get done right, if at all. As
          well, you
          can find yourself in a perpetual state of having many "open
          projects"
          started but not completed. Each project moves forward just an
          inch at a
          time.<br>
          <br>
          If you choose ONE, you can move it forward to completion much
          faster.
          To choose one, you need to estimate which project will give
          you the
          best results when it's finished. It sometimes takes an outside
          perspective and feedback to help you make that choice, and a
          coach is a
          great tool for this.<br>
          <br>
          Putting aside other projects clears the clutter from your
          mind,
          attention, desk, workload and focus.<br>
          <br>
          3. Invest Your Time<br>
          <br>
          Just like we invest our money, we have to invest our time in
          the best
          way.&nbsp; Setting up your new organizing systems can be
          considered an
          investment.<br>
          <br>
          Applying this tip can have the greatest impact on your level
          of
          organization. By investing your time at the beginning of a
          project to
          examine how you can complete it most efficiently, you can save
          yourself
          a lot of frustration later. Saving just 20 minutes each day
          gives you
          an extra 120 hours each year.<br>
          <br>
          For example, set-up a mailing station with all of the supplies
          you'll
          need to ship out book orders. You can also set-up a schedule
          of weekly
          errands such as the bank and the post office. If you know
          you'll be
          heading out to the post office on Wednesday, then when an
          order comes
          in on Friday you don't need to stop what you're doing and
          prepare that
          order immediately. You know you have a different time set
          aside for
          shipping.<br>
          <br>
          4. Make a Habit of It<br>
          <br>
          Once you have these plans in place, work at making them a
          habit. You
          can create a new habit (or lose a bad one!) in 21 days. For
          only three
          weeks of effort, you can create a lifetime of good working
          habits.<br>
          <br>
          As you are creating a habit, you'll need some kind of trigger
          to remind
          you to do it – alarms on your computer (i.e. Outlook or PDA),
          a
          "to do" list or a written schedule for the day with time
          blocked out
          for your specific tasks.<br>
          <br>
          Start small with one new habit at a time, and then see if you
          can add
          more (pull back if it gets to be too much).<br>
          <br>
          5. Use the Right Tools<br>
          <br>
          Make sure you have the right tools handy when you need them.<br>
          <br>
          From the low-tech (I only use retractable pens – the kind that
          "click" on and off – because there's no caps to lose!) to the
          high-tech, there are many ready-made solutions out there to
          keep you
          organized. As we mentioned in Rule #1, it's important to find
          tools
          that work FOR YOU.<br>
          <br>
          Another example – did you know that if you use PayPal as your
          shopping cart, they're automatically tied in with the US Post
          Office
          and you can print your shipping labels right from the PayPal
          site? This
          has been a huge time-saver for me when shipping&nbsp; my
          Organized
          Writer CDs.<br>
          <br>
          6. Work Forward<br>
          <br>
          Organize for your work ahead; don't organize what's already
          finished.
          We're often tempted to organize our old bills, receipts and
          invoices.
          Sometimes we're afraid or hesitant to move forward until we've
          finished
          old stuff.<br>
          <br>
          It's much more important to set-up the system and files for
          what’s coming at you next. Look at what has been creating the
          biggest stress in your life and start by improving that area
          going
          forward. Then, when you have more of your future work under
          control,
          you can deal with the old paperwork (the old bills, receipts
          and
          invoices).<br>
          <br>
          As you work on bringing these six rules into your life, you’ll
          be
          amazed at how much more time and energy you have to pursue
          your writing
          and remember the number one rule – only use what works for
          YOU!<br>
