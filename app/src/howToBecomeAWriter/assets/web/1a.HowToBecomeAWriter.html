          <br>
          If you’re passionate about writing and want to make it your
          career, you need to be resourceful, professional, determined
          and
          self-motivated to succeed. Writing for a living isn’t easy and
          unless you’ve already landed a five figure book deal for your
          latest novel, you need to be as creative in generating income
          as you
          are with your words.<br>
          <br>
          To help you profit from writing, here are a few opportunities
          to
          explore:<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>
            Writing for Magazines</b><br>
          <br>
          This is the starting point for many freelance writers who want
          to be
          published and paid. Magazines require good content and many
          editors
          still rely on freelance writers to provide it. Although the
          market is
          competitive, if you can produce well-researched, original
          articles to
          suit the magazine’s style and readership, you’ll have a
          greater chance of winning a commission.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: Focus on writing about what you know, drawing upon
          any
          specialist knowledge or interests. Use the Internet to study
          publications all over the world to increase your markets.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>
            Write Greetings Card Verses</b><br>
          <br>
          Greetings card companies often seek original verse or prose
          for their
          range of cards. If you have a forte for writing short humorous
          or
          meaningful passages, this could provide a successful opening
          for you.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: Take a look at the verses in greetings cards to study
          their
          style. Create a few sample verses. Note the name of the
          greetings card
          publisher and contact them for their current requirements.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>
            Create Copy for the Business Sector</b><br>
          <br>
          One of the more lucrative writing opportunities is copywriting
          for
          businesses and public sector organisations. If your writing is
          concise,
          clear and fresh, you’ll find there is a market for your
          services
          producing leaflets, guides, press releases, advertising copy
          and web
          content.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: Produce a portfolio of your work to show the
          diversity of your
          skills. Attend a business network event to market your
          services.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Take a Staff Writing Job</b><br>
          <br>
          Freelance writing is great but if you prefer the relative
          security of a
          regular income and the warmth and vitality of a creative
          office
          environment, you might consider applying for a staff based
          writing
          position. Many opportunities exist for journalists,
          copywriters, web
          content writers, editors and feature writers. Recently, a
          major company
          even required the services of a dedicated letter writer! The
          skills of
          a quality writer are in demand and you’ll find that most
          salaries
          reflect this.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: Spend time writing a professional CV and produce some
          sample
          writing. First impressions count!<br>
          <br>
          <b>Become a Ghost-writer</b><br>
          <br>
          Some writers make a reasonable living ghost-writing other
          people’s life stories. You can receive payment on a
          work-for-hire
          basis or on a royalty share agreement. If you enjoy
          interviewing people
          and writing at length, this will have great appeal.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: Speak to other ghost-writers and research the book
          publishing
          field so that you gain a reasonable working knowledge of the
          current
          trends.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Compile Crosswords, Puzzles and Fillers</b><br>
          <br>
          Writing short filler material, from anecdotes to puzzles, can
          be quite
          rewarding. Many publications feature a regular crossword to
          entertain
          their readers. Although considered to be quite a
          closed-market, it is
          worth approaching publications with ideas or samples for
          consideration.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: Research your markets carefully. Target new
          publications where
          there may be openings. Offer fillers and puzzles relevant to
          the target
          readership.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Expand Your Range of Services</b><br>
          <br>
          Some writers find it easy spotting typos or English grammar
          mistakes.
          If you’re one of them, consider taking a course in editing or
          proofreading to expand on your range of wordsmith services!
          There is
          often a decent demand for these services so it will provide an
          additional source of revenue.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: Take a course and gain a qualification. Contact
          publishing
          companies as many now use the services of freelance
          copyeditors and
          proofreaders.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Self-Publish</b><br>
          <br>
          If you have specialist knowledge, consider writing and
          self-publishing
          a book or a series of guides or newsletters! With the right
          topic and
          good marketing, you can build a niche publication. For
          example, some
          authors have turned their hobby of walking into providing
          guidebooks
          and newsletters on local walks. You could do something
          similar, whether
          your interest is sewing, cycling, cooking or woodworking.<br>
          <br>
          My tips: try print-on-demand publishing or publishing
          electronically to
          keep costs down while you’re building your publishing venture.<br>
          <br>
          Good luck in your career as a writer! With the right approach,
          you’ll find there are many opportunities to become a
          successful
          wordsmith.<br>
