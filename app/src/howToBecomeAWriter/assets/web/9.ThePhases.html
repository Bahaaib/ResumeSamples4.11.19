          <br>
          Over the course of my writing life, I have noticed that other
          writers
          and I cycle through a series of steps on our path toward
          maturity as a
          writer. When people come to me for coaching, they often do not
          know
          where they are on the path and what they need to move forward.
          I’ve identified the phases and given suggestions for the
          support
          will best serve at each phase. Of course, I have seen the
          powerful
          impact of coaching at each phase, but I have added other means
          of
          support that are valuable for the writer’s journey.<br>
          <br>
          Infancy You get the spark of creation. You are nervous about
          your
          inclination to write, not knowing where to get advice,
          information and
          support. Sometimes at this phase, people are afraid to even
          say aloud
          that they are a writer. Practice saying it at home, with the
          pets as
          audience, and see how it feels. Your loved ones may think you
          are nuts
          for wanting to write, but you feel more energized than you
          have in
          years. This phase also applies to writers who have taken a
          hiatus from
          writing and are coming back to honor a long-lost urge.<br>
          <br>
          Best support for this phase: Hire a coach. With the support of
          a coach,
          you will be able to recognize that your emotions and
          challenges are
          common. A coach will help you harness that enthusiasm into a
          practice
          that will get you on a strong,<br>
          steady track.<br>
          <br>
          Childhood You have the exuberance of twenty people when it
          comes to
          writing. You want to write everything! You try essays, short
          stories,
          poetry, op-ed letters. Your exuberance and desire to learn
          carries you
          over any hurdles. You get a lot of practice in writing.<br>
          <br>
          Best support for this phase: Take classes and join groups.
          This is a
          great time to be a sponge and absorb all the learning you can.
          Practice
          in whatever genre attracts you. This will help determine where
          your
          gifts lie and how to best use them.<br>
          <br>
          Teen Years Your exuberance turns to restlessness. You want to
          see some
          results – publication, pay even! You yearn to narrow your
          focus
          and choose a path that will bring your writing dreams to
          reality.<br>
          <br>
          Best support for this phase: Hire a coach. At this phase, a
          coach can
          help remind you of your original spark and motivation for
          writing. With
          a coach’s questions, you’ll be able to discover what is
          important for you and how to focus and commit.<br>
          <br>
          Adulthood The rubber hits the road. You settle into your
          chosen genre.
          This may be where you write a novel or a memoir, or really
          develop your
          poetry. This is good, and you start to take yourself
          seriously.<br>
          <br>
          Best support for this phase: Keep learning, with classes,
          books, online
          resources. This is a great time to be in a peer group, giving
          and
          getting feedback on your work. A group facilitated by a coach
          is a good
          idea, as it will help you to deepen your writing practice.<br>
          <br>
          Full Maturity You’ve been at it for a decade or two and now
          realize the magnitude of what it takes to be a writer. This is
          no work
          for lightweights. You have publications under your belt and
          find
          yourself giving advice to whippersnappers writers. You read
          with a
          greater appreciation and realize how amazing good writing
          really is.
          You have a long term plan for your career and feel the power
          of your
          commitment.<br>
          <br>
          Best support for this phase: Befriend writers who are further
          along
          than you. Find a mentor. Work with a coach who can help
          navigate the
          emotional swings of success.<br>
