          It comes along more frequently than not: The thought that
          you’re
          insane and should pursue a career that doesn’t stomp on your
          pride or demolish your ego. You have the hopes of fame and
          fortune to
          comfort you at times, but not often enough to keep doubt from
          gnawing
          at your mind.<br>
          <br>
          Discouragement is a constant companion. You face rejections.
          You spend
          time, money and energy with no guarantee of financial gain
          (and if
          you’re published, you face rejections; spend time, money and
          energy with no guarantee of financial gain). You endure looks
          of
          healthy disdain from people when you reveal you’re a writer.
          If
          you’re a literary writer, you’re regarded with some awe; a
          genre author; however, is looked upon with the same reverence
          as a
          stripper.<br>
          <br>
          At times like these, quitting seems like a sensible thing to
          do. I
          would encourage it, if you are constantly depressed and on the
          verge of
          madness. It isn’t worth your sanity and publishing isn’t an
          industry that is concerned with keeping you sane. Drinking may
          no
          longer be common among writers, but it certainly is a
          temptation.<br>
          <br>
          If rejections make you want to bang your head against the
          wall, writing
          is painful and the thought of another damn story swimming in
          your head
          makes you nauseous - Stop. Now. If you can’t stop, there’s
          help. Here are five reasons to stay a writer:<br>
          <br>
          You don’t have to submit your work. There’s no obligation
          for a writer to share their work with editors and critics
          (Emily
          Dickinson is a fine example) you can write for the pleasure of
          it. If
          you do wish to publicize your work, you can self-publish.
          However, you
          don’t need to be published to be a writer (I know I keep
          saying
          this, but I will continue to do so until I am believed).
          Validation is
          great, creation divine. Create, explore, indulge! Be free.
          Write.<br>
          <br>
          For immortality. When you die, there is a distinct possibility
          that
          your unpublished works will be discovered, you’ll be
          proclaimed a
          genius, your books will be translated into many languages both
          live and
          dead, turned into a film every few decades and inspire legions
          of
          writers who are obscure and writing anyway. If you don’t
          write,
          there will be nothing to discover.<br>
          <br>
          Revenge. Remember that teacher who bloodied your beloved
          essays with
          red marks? That scathing critique partner with ‘helpful
          advice?’ That insolent editor who didn't even bother to send a
          form rejection, but scribbled ‘No thanks’ on your query?
          Well, write to show the bastards! Strong emotions are a great
          motivation to write. Write to prove them wrong.<br>
          <br>
          We need stories. Naturally, literary snobs would beg to
          differ,
          thinking literature is being polluted by uneducated neophytes
          who have
          the audacity to write because they have the ability to type
          their names.<br>
          <br>
          Fortunately, I find their opinions as necessary as Athletes’
          foot. Therefore, I implore you to tell your tales in your
          voice. No
          copycats please. It doesn’t matter if your prose doesn’t
          ring like Jane Austen, echo like J. California Cooper, bellow
          like Mark
          Twain, sing like JK Rowling’s or linger like Anne Lamott’s.
          We need stories to survive. Help us.<br>
          <br>
          You get to determine your success. Writing can afford you big
          and
          little successes. The poem that brought a smile to your
          friend’s
          face, the essay that saved the front page of the neighborhood
          newsletter, the short story that helped a lonely teenager
          through a
          hard time, the novel that opened someone’s mind to a new way
          of
          thinking.<br>
          <br>
          Okay, so you may never hit the bestseller’s list, win a
          National
          Book Award or any award for that matter. Perhaps only the sky
          will know
          your gifts. You’re living a dream few people allow themselves
          to
          experience. They talk about writing--some very loudly--but few
          do it.
          The world bends to those who proclaim who they are without
          apology
          (okay it doesn’t actually bend, but it does bow a little).<br>
          <br>
          Because you must. That’s reason enough for me. I don’t have
          a style or voice that many know and my work isn’t breaking any
          records. There are times I want to throw up my hands and say,
          “Enough! I quit!” And the world sighs with relief, and I
          sigh feeling in control of my future. I stand up from my desk
          determined never to return. Then a little voice says... “There
          was this woman who discovered she was married to the wrong
          man...”<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
