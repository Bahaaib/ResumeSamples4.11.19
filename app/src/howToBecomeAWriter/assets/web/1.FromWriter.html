          As a newly self published author, I am amazed by how many
          people have
          told me that they have a novel or idea for a book that they
          always
          wanted to have published. I usually tell these aspiring
          writers that it
          can happen and, if they are willing to listen, I tell them my
          story
          about how I self published my book. I have always enjoyed
          writing,
          mostly for my own enjoyment, but knew I had a talent for
          creative
          writing. <br>
          <br>
          My first audience was my co-workers at a bank I worked for in
          Seattle,
          where everyday, I filled in for the receptionist while she
          when to
          lunch.&nbsp; During that hour, I wrote installments to a
          suspense
          thriller, set on the Oregon coast, which I shared with the
          other
          assistants on the floor who eagerly awaited my new chapters.
          Years
          later, I moved to Hawaii and sent regular email updates of my
          adventures to my friends, which I called “Memos from Maui.”
          Living in Hawaii is kind of like living in a foreign country
          and I had
          fun sharing my observations of life on a tropical island.
          “Memos
          from Maui” were well received and I knew then that I was
          hooked;
          I had to do something with my writing. <br>
          <br>
          Like the aspiring writers I mentioned earlier, I too was
          engaged in
          making a living as well as dealing with life’s other
          distractions. I have had a number of different careers, but
          none gave
          me the satisfaction I felt when I had people tell me that they
          liked my
          writing.<br>
          <br>
          Returning to the mainland, I settled into a familiar routine
          of working
          for a living. One day, I picked up a Learning Annex catalog
          and came
          across a screenwriting class and decided to enroll. The
          instructor’s name was Lew Hunter, who for years taught his
          “Screenwriting 434” at the UCLA Film School. His method for
          writing a screenplay is a formula based on the three-act Greek
          play.
          His class taught specific methods of story and character
          development.
          It gave me an entirely different set of tools as a writer and
          I began
          to write my first screenplay. After 3 months of writing, I
          completed
          Dance of the Heart. <br>
          <br>
          The method of writing I learned from Lew made the process of
          writing
          much more structured and as a result, made writing easier. I
          sent my
          screenplay off to a couple of screenwriting competitions and
          readers,
          but like most screenplays that are written, it didn’t get
          noticed. My story sat in my files for about 5 years until I
          decided
          that I believed in my story and that I would rewrite it into a
          novel. I
          took me about a year, but I finally finished Dance of the
          Heart as a
          novel.<br>
          <br>
          When I was ready to explore how to get published, I again
          picked up a
          Learning Annex catalog and found a daylong “Book Camp,”
          which was a workshop on how to publish a book. It was an
          informative
          day and I quickly realized that getting my book published by a
          traditional publisher was as likely as my screenplay being
          made into a
          movie. <br>
          <br>
          The good news was that the instructor, Penny Sansevieri, a
          self-published author of “From Book to Bookseller,” had
          representatives from companies at the workshop that offered
          self-publishing services to writers. They provided me the
          technical
          support and expertise that I lacked and made it possible for
          me to
          publish my novel. <br>
          <br>
          So with motivation and dedication, and a little help from the
          Learning
          Annex, I am now a published author and am quick to share with
          others
          that they too can realize their dream of seeing their words in
          print.
          It’s just a matter of being committed to your dream; believing
          in
          your work and not letting anyone say it can’t be done. I am
          proof
          that it can!<br>
