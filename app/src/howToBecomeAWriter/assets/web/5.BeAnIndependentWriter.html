          The world of publishing is about to change. It's an exciting
          time to be
          an Independent author. This long ignored group is beginning to
          organize
          and establish an entirely new marketplace for selling books. A
          community introducing voices never heard and stories never
          told to the
          world.<br>
          <br>
          What they need is an on-line destination created for
          Independently
          published writers to promote and sell their books.<br>
          <br>
          It is difficult to be an Independent author. The term "self
          published"
          is often used and misunderstood because major components of
          the
          publishing industry, including the six largest publishers,
          have been
          successful in attaching "poor quality" to the term
          "self-published."
          The term Independent author best describes the decision many
          writers
          have made to publish on their own.<br>
          <br>
          The fact that someone decides to become an Independent author
          does not
          mean their writing is not good. It means they have made the
          decision to
          publish Independently and remain in control of the work
          creatively and
          financially. Being an Independent author is hard, doors slam
          and there
          are plenty of "do not enter" signs, which is the reason many
          Independent authors give up in their quest to sell books.<br>
          <br>
          Many Independent authors feel strongly that their
          pay-for-printing
          publisher does not care whether they sell a single copy of
          their book.
          The printer's profit is made in the printing itself, not the
          final sale
          of the book. These authors cite instances where messages are
          sent
          proclaiming, "Buy this service and you will sell books," only
          to find
          the statement hollow and without merit or success. In the end
          the only
          thing the Independent author has is an extremely fragmented
          market.<br>
          <br>
          The hope for increased sales of Independent books is through
          banding
          together as a single community speaking from a single
          platform, authors
          helping create their own market for readers looking for new
          voices and
          interesting stories. As an Independent writer and author,
          trust in the
          fact that this community will be an opportunity to sell books
          and gain
          respectability in the marketplace we so richly deserve.<br>
          <br>
          The dynamic of the market for book sales is about to shift and
          the
          Independent author is in the right place at the right time to
          take full
          advantage. There has never been a better time to be an
          Independent
          author. Countless opportunities are opening that offer more
          exposure to
          a wider audience than ever before.<br>
          <br>
          Strength is in numbers, so we need to have a gathering place
          for
          writers and authors, a community where we will be heard by
          readers
          searching for voices never heard and stories never told. The
          world of
          traditional brick and mortar publishing is struggling, over
          the course
          of the past fifteen years the market has been shrinking. The
          six
          largest publishers are forced to push more copies of a handful
          of
          authors out into stores each and every month. This is
          negatively
          impacting overall sales at a time when book retailers,
          wholesalers, and
          distributors are consolidating and demanding change. The
          problem is
          that the big companies do not have answers.<br>
          <br>
          They constantly search for new writers but the demands of the
          business
          make it harder for them to create successful authors. The
          marketplace
          has been structured by their own hand to allow only a small
          window of
          opportunity for new authors to make their presence known.
          Retailers are
          geared towards instant success and immediate sales, while the
          system is
          not in place to allow that to happen. As a result the big
          publishers
          are in a quandary.<br>
          <br>
          At the same time, Independent authors are about to make a
          statement
          that will surely rock the traditional world of publishing.
          They are on
          the verge of making a huge impact never before witnessed in
          the
          industry. No longer will Independent authors and small
          publishers have
          to struggle in the old ways of selling books. A truly
          limitless, global
          audience waits.<br>
          <br>
          Independent writers and authors are about to emerge from the
          shadows
          and take their rightful place in the market. This is a brave
          new world
          for readers clamoring for voices never heard and stories never
          told.<br>
          <br>
          They need a site that will introduce readers around the world
          to books
          they might never have found, and provide an opportunity for
          the
          Independent author to expand their audience like never before.
          The site
          exists, and is welcoming Independent authors and their books.<br>
          <br>
          It is extremely difficult for major publishers to sell all of
          their
          titles. What chance does an Independent author have of making
          a real
          dent and sell enough copies to warrant continuous shelf space
          and
          sizable reorders? Not impossible but not probable either. The
          future
          for the Independently published book is sales through the
          Internet.
          There are tremendous possibilities in those areas without
          having to
          fight and scratch for inches inside a traditional bookstore.<br>
          <br>
          The big six have not figured out how to utilize the Internet
          to their
          advantage, but when they do, they will monopolize your
          opportunities.
          Beat them to it. Join the new community, the online market for
          your
          books. The future for substantial sales of Independently
          published
          books is not the local bookstore, but at the independent
          author's
          online bookstore.<br>
