          <p>As a golfer, you probably ask yourself this question almost
            every time you get onto the green: 'How do I improve my
            swing?' It's
            likely you've played for quite some time, had a few good
            drives and had
            a lot of, ahem, bad ones.</p>
          <p>Perhaps you've even bought a few books or videos because
            you're looking for the perfect swing. Despite all the
            information
            available many people still struggle to perfect their golf
            swing.</p>
          <p>Let's begin with a few basics:</p>
          <p><b>Eliminating Golf Swing myths</b></p>
          <p>Ever seen some of the claims that if you just bought this
            new
            ball you could get 33% more distance! How about the club
            that will
            improve your distance? However, how much good can you get
            with extra
            distance if you can't get the ball to go the direction you
            need it to
            go?</p>
          <p>No golf club will 'correct' your swing. Certain clubs will
            help you to understand what's happening when you swing.
            These training
            tools may help you in various ways to know what you're
            doing, however,
            you still must proactively do something to improve your golf
            swing.</p>
          <p>Some say that if you slice your ball you need to get a
            stronger position on your grip or a hook grip. It can help
            you get your
            ball to go straighter, but it's not going to help you get a
            better
            swing. The grip is the grip and there's more to the swing
            than just
            that.</p>
          <p><b>Reinforcing the Basics</b></p>
          <p>To get a perfect golf swing, you need to think through the
            foundations you learned when you first started:</p>

      <big>
      </big>
    </ul>
    <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
      </font></big>
    <p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>
          </big></font></big></p>
    <p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>As simple as
            it sounds combine and perfect the above and
            you'll have a perfect golf swing. It's as simple as
            analyzing what's
            not working and correcting it.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>
          <p>Remember everything about the game of Golf begins with you
            and
            your mental attitude about yourself, the game, the course
            and how you
            approach all of it. Let's start by doing something that's so
            basic
            people tend to forget about it.</p>
          <p><b>The Mental Part of the Perfect Golf Swing</b></p>
          <p>Confidence is needed when you step up to the tee. You have
            the
            confidence you need when you get in your car, you know how
            to position
            yourself to make a left or right turn, stop sharply and
            accelerate as
            simple as it seems now, remember how complicated it
            originally seemed?
            You need this same confidence on the course.</p>
          <p>When you step up to the tee all of the physical practicing
            that has gone on before stops. The training stops, as well.
            You are 'on
            your own' so to speak. What you have been doing will come
            into play
            only because what you have been doing is now between your
            ears. It is
            time to put that mental game of yours into effect.</p>
          <p>Every thing you do from the tee on the first hole to the
            napkin at the '19th' comes from that mental game you are
            playing. Every
            shot needs to analyzed, every hazard must be evaluated,
            every lay of
            the grounds must be used to make the next shot better, the
            next hazard
            something to bypass and the grounds something that simply
            is.</p>
          <p>Let's face it, on the average round of golf you do not
            spend
            an awful lot of time actually hitting the ball. You walk,
            wait for the
            shots of your partners, searching for your ball or others'
            and thinking
            all of the time about what you need to do on the next shot.</p>
          <p>What is it that affects your game? Is it the physical side?
            Does walking and waiting and searching really take it's toll
            on your
            game or is it all of the time you have to think about what
            you are
            doing?</p>
          <p>Jack Nicklaus has a lot to say about the mental side of the
            game. He thought it was critical. He didn't try to just
            avoid negative
            thoughts, a good thing to avoid by the way, he visualized
            each shot in
            his mind before he even got close to the ball! He could see
            his ball
            being hit and the flight and where it landed and how he
            would approach
            it when he got to it.</p>
          <p>On the green he would see the lay of the grass and the hole
            and the pin and where his ball would go before he took out
            his putter.
            He had the whole game played before he got out of the club
            house and
            that is one of the things, he says, that made his game the
            world class
            game it was.</p>
          <p><b>Golf Swing - Grip &amp; Posture</b></p>
          <p>Many specialists speak of the pros or cons of one grip over
            another however you must remember any of these are fine, as
            long as you
            master the basics: both palms face each other, club held in
            your
            fingers - not the palm, thumb pointed down the middle of the
            shaft,
            with your wrists relaxed.</p>
          <p>Alongside your grip it's essential you have a strong
            posture
            and stance; feet shoulder width, toes slightly pointed out,
            knees
            slightly bent and bend from the hips. Your back should be
            straight and
            your arms and hands held naturally.</p>
          <p>You can see those things in your mind and can 'practice'
            you're posture and grip easily when you're sitting at home
            or driving
            your car.</p>
          <p><b>Bring It All Together With the Perfect Alignment</b></p>
          <p>Bring that mental game out to the practice range and set
            yourself up on a tee. Your alignment must be correct for all
            of the
            above to work. Steady your stance, make sure that your left
            shoulder is
            facing the direction you need the ball to go and remember
            the
            following:
            <br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Be confident. That comes from knowledge and experience.</li>
            <li>'Think' your shot before you make your shot.</li>
            <li>'Practice' on the range. Golf on the course.</li>
            <li>Always get a good practice swing before addressing the
              ball.</li>
            <li>After the practice swing, approach the ball and just hit
              it.</li>
            <li>Think about that shot. What went wrong, if anything, and
              how do you improve it?</li>
            <li>Relax, breathe normally.</li>
          </ul>

              Pivot Gives You The Power! </b></big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
      </font></big>
    <p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>There
            is a proper position for the proper pivot. It
            starts with the posture and transforms in the perfect swing
            by being
            exactly what is needed. It is the basic shifting of your
            weight from
            the one side to the other side.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
      </font></big>
    <p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>A
            reverse pivot problem is what the vast majority
            of golfers have no matter how long they have been playing.
            They move
            the weight in the wrong direction! In that mental game you
            are playing,
            see and feel the weight moving to the left or forward foot.
            That will
            allow you to bring the club down, in the forward swing, with
            all of the
            power you have and hit the ball cleanly while you are
            essentially
            moving forward.</big></font></big></p>
    <big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">

    <p><big><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><big>You
            need to be able to enjoy Golf! It's one of the
            few games that require a bit of thought and can be practiced
            with the
            mind as well as the body. You may need the instruction that
            a golf pro
