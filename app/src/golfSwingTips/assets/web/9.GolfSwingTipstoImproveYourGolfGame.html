          <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
          <p>The golf swing has been called the most difficult part of
            golf. A consistent swing is nothing but essential to cutting
            strokes
            off your game. The mechanics are elementary yet an extremely
            important
            part that you must master if you want to play the game well.
            Help for
            your golf swing is here.</p>
          <p><b>Improve Your Mechanics</b></p>
          <p>Achieving the correct mechanics to the swing is the key
            that
            will open all the doors to satisfaction and a more enjoyable
            golf
            experience. You must first know that a full golf swing is
            needed to
            produce maximum club head speed and ultimately distance from
            the tee.
            Improve your mechanics of the swing and you will find that
            the maximum
            club head speed will be obtained. Improve your golf swing,
            and you'll
            find your overall game greatly improving. Therefore you
            should always
            try to look for ways to improve your swing.</p>
          <p><b>Practice Plan</b></p>
          <p>Practice is essential, but those endless sessions can
            become
            incredibly frustrating if you don't have a plan and many of
            us don't.
            Practice and knowledge is one thing but the ability to
            physically
            execute and execute consistently is another. The swing of a
            good golf
            player that you see is the result of a lot of work and
            practice. If
            your swing is not what it should be then you can correct the
            problems
            that you are having with a little help and a little
            practice. The more
            that you practice your golf swing the better your swing will
            get. I
            suggest that whenever you practice write down what your
            goals for that
            particular session will be and have a plan.</p>
          <p><b>Information on the Swing</b></p>
          <p>To improve your swing you need accurate information. For
            years, information on the one plane swing has been scarcely
            available
            apart from a few books on the market. However, now that we
            have the
            internet, information is abundant and readily available for
            free. If
            you really do absorb the information you receive and put it
            to use you
            should improve your game by at least 7 strokes.You need to
            be careful-
            a lot of the information you're bombarded with on the
            internet, in
            magazines, books, TV, etc. may not give you the results you
            want. The
            only way for you to truly know if the information is correct
            is to try
            it yourself. Find someone who has tried it and see what they
            think. Ask
            a pro, a good golfer, or someone you see improving and see
            what they
            think. Buy a golf swing product for yourself and test it.
            Many products
            give you a satisfaction guarantee or your money back.
            Personally, I
            like the simple one plane swing as it is consistent and
            accurate. For
            the normal golfers who do not have the physical build like
            Tiger it is
            the only way to go.</p>
