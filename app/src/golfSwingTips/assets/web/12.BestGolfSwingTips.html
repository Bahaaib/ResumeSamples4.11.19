          <p>When looking to improve their golf games, many people will
            turn to new equipment to try and improve their handicaps.
            However, this
            is a shallow solution that avoids the real issue. This
            method may shave
            a stroke or two off of your game, if you are lucky. However,
            if you are
            struggling with your game, the culprit most likely is your
            swing.
            Improving your swing is the best of the golf swing tips to
            improve your
            score. Following are the best golf swing tips for you to
            become a
            better player.</p>
          <p><b>Practice with a Mirror: Best of the Swing Tips</b></p>
          <p>Using a mirror is one of the great swing tips, especially
            on
            rainy days. Set a full length mirror up in your garage or a
            room with a
            high ceiling in your house. Grab a 6-iron and face the
            mirror. First,
            check your grip by looking both down at your hands and into
            the mirror,
            and make sure it is correct. Next, look at your clubface.
            Make sure it
            is not open or closed, but solidly squared up. Then make
            sure your
            stance is slightly more than shoulder width apart. Also
            check to ensure
            that the ball is slightly forward in your stance.</p>
          <p>Once you have your stance and grip perfected, you will be
            ready to practice your swing. You will go through 5 sets of
            5 swings
            each. During the first set, only swing at about 20% of your
            normal
            power and speed. Each subsequent set add 20% to your power
            and speed,
            until you are swinging at full force on the last set. Pay
            close
            attention to your balance, your grip, and your smoothness on
            each
            swing. Try and make every swing exactly the same. It will be
            harder
            with each successive increase in power, but it will become
            easier with
            each session that your practice. Practice this best of the
            golf swing
            tips daily for maximum results.</p>
          <p><b>Another of the Great Golf Swing Tips: Improve Your
              Balance and
              Your Swing Will Follow</b></p>
          <p>The next best of golf swing tips concerns balance. Balance
            is
            the single most important part of any sport, and that holds
            very much
            true for golf. Having the proper balance during each portion
            of the
            golf swing ensures a smooth and powerful striking of the
            ball.
            Following are the four major positions in the golf swing, as
            well as
            how your body should be balanced during each position.</p>
          <p>The first position in the perfect swing is the setup.
            During
            this portion of the swing, your weight should be equally
            balanced
            between your front foot and your back foot. During the
            setup, your
            weight should also be balanced equally between the balls and
            heels of
            your feet.</p>
          <p>The next position in a perfect swing is the top of the
            backswing. At the top of the backswing, your weight should
            be around
            75% on your back foot. All of this weight on your back foot
            should be
            on the inside of your back foot. It should never shift to
            the outside
            of the back foot.</p>
          <p>The third position during the swing is the moment of impact
            with the ball. At this moment, you should have 75% of your
            weight on
            your front foot. Your head should be behind the ball. Your
            hips will be
            around 4 inches past they were in at the moment of setup. If
            done
            correctly, your spine should be tilted sharply towards your
            back foot
            at the moment of impact.</p>
          <p>The last position in the golf swing is the follow through.
            At
            the end of the swing, 90% of your weight should be on the
            outside of
            your front foot.</p>
          <p>Checking your balance in all these positions will feel
            extremely awkward at first. Take your time and stick with
            it, and you
            will be amazed at the improvement in your swing. Practice
            these golf
            swing tips as much as you can. The more you practice golf
            swing tips,
            the better your results will be.</p>
