          <p>Would you like to develop a sound, simple and reliable
            basic
            golf swing? I'm sure that you know there are countless golf
            lessons
            online as well as a great deal of video golf instruction
            that describes
            the drills golf teachers use to improve golf swing faults,
            but very few
            golf instructors actually get to the root cause of why most
            golf swing
            problems begin in the first place.</p>
          <p>In this golf instruction article I'm going to share with
            you a
            simple way to improve your basic golf swing plane so you can
            hit
            consistently longer and straighter golf shots, increase your
            golf
            confidence and develop lower score golf scores.</p>
          <p>The majority of golf swing faults produced by amateur
            golfers
            can be traced back to a faulty swing plane that is not
            aligned
            correctly both in terms of its alignment to the target and
            its
            alignment to the plane angle it originated on.</p>
          <p>The engineers that designed your golf clubs understand the
            importance of the swing plane but unfortunately when golfers
            purchase
            golf clubs from a golf shop or pro shop, as a rule they
            don't get a
            user manual with the golf clubs that describes how the golf
            clubs
            should be used correctly.</p>
          <p>Kind of funny really when you think about it, considering
            that
            most expensive items you purchase have some form of
            instruction manual
            with them.</p>
          <p>Anyway, there is one inarguable fact that you need to know
            and
            trust about improving your basic golf swing. The fact is
            that you need
            to swing your golf club on or very close to the original
            swing plane if
            you want to really improve the way you hit the golf ball.</p>
          <p>The original swing plane is the angle of the golf club
            you're
            using when you address a golf ball. From driver to putter
            every golf
            club is built on an inclined plane angle because the golf
            ball is
            positioned to the side of you and in front of you.</p>
          <p>This plane angle is slightly different with every club in
            your
            bag and so your job is to rest it on the ground as it was
            designed with
            the club face pointing directly to your target and then
            build your golf
            swing around it.</p>
          <p>To do this effectively you need to hold onto the golf club
            lightly enough that the club face doesn't aim off line. Many
            amateur
            golfers I've taught at my golf school over the years squeeze
            the grip
            so tightly that the club face is twisted which creates golf
            swing
            alignment errors leading to common golf shots like slices,
            pulls and
            even fat shots.</p>
          <p>If your grip pressure is higher than five on a one to ten
            scale (with ten being too tight) then you are squeezing too
            tightly.
            Also when you hold onto the grip your right hand (right hand
            golfer)
            should be positioned on the side of the grip so that when
            you open the
            palm of your hand up it would point straight down the target
            line.</p>
          <p>When your hand is placed under the golf grip (facing the
            sky),
            or on top of it (facing the ground), you will in all
            probability alter
            the swing plane direction as you swing back away from the
            ball.
            Remember to build your golf swing around the design of the
            golf club
            which means that your rest it on the ground and point it
            towards your
            intended target. When you swing it away there are two basic
            but very
            important stages that your golf club should travel through.</p>
          <p><b>Basic Swing Plane Stage 1:</b></p>
          <p>1. The golf club should swing directly away from the ball
            without lifting upwards abruptly or traveling inwards or
            outwards too
            quickly as it goes back. Imagine for a moment that your golf
            club was
            laying flat on a piece of cardboard on the same angle as the
            golf club
            and that the club simply traveled backwards and forwards
            along the card
            board until the club head and shaft was parallel with the
            ground.</p>
          <p><b>Basic Swing Plane Stage 2:</b></p>
          <p>2. Now, if the golf club traveled further back the club
            head
            would now be higher than your hands but would still be on or
            close to
            the piece of card board. As it travels back the grip end of
            the golf
            shaft would point directly to the base of the card board
            where the golf
            club once rested.</p>
          <p>The golf shaft angle is maintained as it travels from the
            start of the back-swing to the top and into the down swing
            and
            follow-through phases.</p>
          <p>The best way to learn to do this is to practice with a
            pitching wedge and swing it back until your left arm and
            golf club form
            an angle that would represent the letter 'L.' In this
            position your
            left arm would be horizontal and the golf shaft
            vertical-although it
            would point towards the target line.</p>
          <p>When you swing into the follow-through you again form a
            horizontal arm position only this time it's with your right
            arm, and
            the golf shaft would again be vertical and pointing down
            towards the
            target line.</p>
          <p>I call this golf stroke the 'Level 1' basic golf swing as
            it's
            the first stage of the full golf swing. Just like a house
            needs a
            strong and sound foundation to be built upon, your golf
            swing needs a
            strong and sound foundation to swing upon. By practicing the
            level one
            golf swing you are building the type of support your golf
            swing needs
            to control the distance and direction of the golf ball
            easily.</p>
          <p>Remember that it's easy to just swing away without really
            thinking much about what you're doing. But consider that the
            golf clubs
            only real purpose is to achieve a sound impact and you will
            realize the
            importance of swinging your golf club on its correct plane
            angle.</p>
          <p>Even if you can't make it out to a driving range or
            practice
            fairway, practice the level one swing often and you'll
            notice a
            considerable difference in your shot-making consistency
            within three
            months.</p>
          <p>Every sound golf swing has a level one position built into
            it
            and so can yours so start practicing your golf swing on a
            daily basis
            and in the hours, days and months ahead you'll discover the
            power and
            purpose of the on-plane basic golf swing.</p>
