          <p>Are simple golf swing tips a waste of time? Well, to
            improve
            your golf game there is no substitute for getting proper
            instruction
            from your local pro. He can help you develop sound technique
            and work
            out a practice regime to instil these swing fundamentals.
            However,
            quick golf swing tips also have their place in helping your
            golf. They
            can sometimes just help spark your game into life - a
            certain new swing
            thought may just help get your golf swing on the right
            plane, or a
            small change in your set up can have a major impact on your
            impact
            position.</p>
          <p>Here are 3 simple golf swing tips that could just make that
            small but vital difference to your golf swing:</p>
          <p>In golf a good shoulder turn is important. But how that
            shoulder turn is created is often misunderstood, and as a
            result leads
            to poor ball striking. Golfers sometimes make the mistake of
            thinking
            it is the length of the backswing that generates power. In
            an attempt
            to make a long backswing they allow their left heel to come
            up too far
            off the ground and their hips to turn too much. While this
            action may
            create turn, it does not produce coil. The main role of the
            backswing
            should be to stretch, or coil the muscles. It is then the
            release of
            that coiling action in the downswing that helps create
            power. The
            length of your backswing should be determined by how much
            coil you can
            create, not how far back you can swing the club.</p>
          <p>Allowing your chin to rest against your chest at address
            makes
            it impossible to swing your left arm across your upper body
            in the
            backswing. When the natural path of the shoulders is
            blocked, it
            encourages you to pick the club up too steeply with your
            hands. The
            result is little or no weight transfer on to your right
            side, creating
            a backswing that is far too narrow. The resulting downswing
            becomes too
            steep and you usually end up chopping down on the ball
            instead of
            swinging through. Keep your chin up and allow your left arm
            to move
            freely across your chest. This will enable you to create the
            full wide
            arc required to strike the ball correctly.</p>
          <p>When under pressure, many golfers make the understandable
            mistake of snatching the club away too quickly in their
            backswing. This
            gets the hands and body moving at different speeds and
            destroys the
            swings natural rhythm. Here is one of those simple mental
            golf swing
            tips which if used should help slow down the start of your
            backswing.
            At address, imagine there is a ball and chain attached to
            the clubhead.
            In order to start the club back you have to drag that ball
            along with
            it. Not only will this image help slow down you take-away,
            it will also
            make it easier for the rest of your body to work at the same
            pace as
            your hands.</p>
          <p>One of these golf swing tips may help to instantly kick
            start
            your golf swing into action, but, remember that you should
            only have
            one (or two maximum) golf swing thoughts while you play.<br>
