          Remember this, buying the beer is not the most expensive part
          of the beverage cart girl's stop at your group. It's the tip
          that is expensive. You don't want to be known at the course as
          the cheap guy, so you should tip her well. Besides, if you
          want ( or need) her to show up more than once a round you will
          have to bribe her. That can get expensive. So you will have to
          decide whether to buy the beer of do the tip.<br>
          <br>
          Do this before you tee off. Take a look at who you are playing
          with. Are they are bunch of drunks who will consume massive
          amounts of beer on the course. If so tip, man, tipping is the
          best option! And tell them that is what you are going to do.
          Then bribe the cart girl on the first trip, she will feel
          happy, she will come back, and then you can either stiff her
          on the next tip or just tip her less. Or you can be a good guy
          and tip her well all day long. Your choice, after all, you are
          the tipper.<br>
          <br>
          Speaking of tips. I have a few for you.<br>

          <br>
          There has never been a good golfer with a bad grip. So get
          your grip right. Unless you are new to the game, you already
          know that your grip is probably wrong. But you do it anyway
          because,"it feels good" so no excuses. A grip change is not
          easy, but it is a critical part of your simple golf swing.
          Most teaching pros will tell you what the correct grip is,
          then they will forget all about it knowing you won't do it
          anyway. Then they give you a $60.00 lesson with a bad grip.
          Man!<br>

          <br>
          Have you ever chunked a chip shot that you had to get close to
          make par or even a bogey? There is absolutely nothing more
          aggravating, right? Here is the answer to this foolish and
          embarrassing mistake. Hit down! You have to hit down on the
          ball. Not one single thing else matters here. Hit down. Every
          good player does it, all poor players never do it. Hit down
          and the ball goes up. Hit down and you won't peek. Hit down
          and you put spin on the ball. Hit down and you won't hit it
          across the green low and hard. Hit down and you get a sweet
          feeling in your hands and arms and the ball reacts to this as
          if by magic.<br>
          <br>
          <b>$ 10.00 Golf swing tip number three. </b><br>
          <br>
          You know that three foot putt that you are standing over. The
          one the breaks left to right by a foot or so. The one that, if
          you make it, will secure for you the best round you have ever
          had and you kick your playing partners rear end. <br>
          <br>
          Do you know what I am talking about? If you played any amount
          of golf at all, you know exactly what I am talking about. So,
          do you make it or not? Dr. Bob Rotella, a noted sport
          psychologist who works with the best golfers in the world,
          says that one way to make more of these putts is to try less.
          WHAT! Yeah, I know it sounds nuts, but is it? <br>
          <br>
          Take it to the practice green and see. Take 4 or 5 balls and
          put them in a circle around the hole. Say 5-10 feet away. On
          each putt, you want to try very hard to try less. <br>
          <br>
          Do this often and you will find the medium amount of effort
          you need to make more putts. Once you have found this, you
          will need to practice a while using this level of trying. Soon
          it will become in your head and the next time you are faced
          with the game breaking putt. Well it ( your effort level) be
          in your head and you will execute. <br>
          <br>
          This is an excellent tip. Worth more than $ 10.00.. I used
          this years ago to decrease my sense of disaster. It worked
          wonders. Try it. A reallly good golf swing tip.<br>

          <b>$10.00 Golf Swing tip number four. </b><br>
          <br>
          If someone tells you, that you hit a bad shot because you
          picked your head up. You can trust that you did not do that.
          It is not what you think. You did not pick your head up. It
          just looked like you did. WHAt? <br>
          <br>
          Well stay with me here. <br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b> This golf swing tip is a tad complicated. </b><br>
          <br>
          If you appeared to pick your head up on your golf swing, it
          means that you have not HIT DOWN on the ball. There is nothing
          else in the golf swing that matters. You must hit down. So try
          this. ( this is one of those I told you so moments) get a
          proper grip, you cannot consistently hit down on the ball if
          you have a bad grip. Sorry! Get a grip. Right hand a little
          more on top of the club, never under. Right hand a little more
          on the top. Right hand a little more on the top. Got it?<br>
          <br>
          The very idea of hitting down on the ball is as old as the
          game itself. But to most, it is a little known secret and an
          impossible concept to grasp. But You must do it. You must, you
          must, you must.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Reasons why you did not hit down. </b><br>
          <br>
          Your spine angle tipped back away from the ball. This creates
          an impossible angle problem for hitting down. What is it? Well
          it makes it impossible to hit down. Your weight is on your
          back foot, your hips are not under your shoulders anymore,
          they are ahead of them. And the only way to hit the ball is to
          hit up. Which is exactly what you do, and it looks like you "
          lifted your head up "<br>
          <br>
          You stop this move by moving your hands and arms first toward
          the ball, pushing the club down and toward the ball with your
          RIGHT hand ( that now has the correct grip) and you do this
          first, before your body does anything at all. Want a key to
          this move? <br>

          and all bad players do not do. There is no reason in the whole
