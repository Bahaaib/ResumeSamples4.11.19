          <p>Now tips on golf swing can be collected from a number of
            sources including online golf swing articles. Some new
            golfers believe
            that religiously practicing the golf swing tips online would
            significantly improve their golf swings. The greater the
            time devoted
            to practicing, the greater the improvement you will find in
            the golf
            swing.</p>
          <p>So many tips are offered online that you just need to
            practice
            until you are satisfied with your swing and eventually,
            you'll see an
            improvement in your golf game or not have a sliced shot
            anymore.</p>
          <p>Sliced shots can be very frustrating even if you're a new
            golf
            player. A sliced shot is an uncontrolled shot, where instead
            of flying
            straight ahead, the ball goes on a curved path to the right.</p>
          <p>What causes sliced shots? The real solution for this sliced
            problem is the correct understanding of its causes.
            Correcting the
            causes based on online golf swing instructions would
            eventually reduce
            the occurrence of sliced shots.</p>
          <p>Sliced shots result from an incorrect golf swing, through
            the
            wrong coordination of the golfer's body and arms. Other
            players say
            that they see an improvement in their golf game when they
            tried
            following golf swing tips online. Review the following golf
            tips to
            improve your scoring and cure your sliced shots.</p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Swing With Your Body</p>
          <p>Looking at golfers, it seems that their golf shots depend
            on
            how they swing their arms. Actually, it's not. The quality
            of the swing
            actually results from the proper use of the body.</p>
          <p>An incorrect golf swing puts much work on the arms such
            that
            after a few holes you will start to feel pain. This is not a
            sign that
            you need to workout more but rather a signal of an improper
            use of the
            body and arms. You'll see this illustrated in some golf
            swing tips
            online. Your arms alone are not supposed to be used in
            executing a
            downturn swing.</p>
          <p>When you swing with your arms, there is less control of the
            movement which affects the club position as it reaches the
            ball. This
            kind of club contact causes the ball to travel at an angle
            instead of
            in a straight line, as you intend. The movement should come
            from the
            shoulders rather than the arms.</p>
          <p style="font-weight: bold;">Swing with effortless power</p>
          <p>Another golf swing tip states that golf swing power is a
            result of the upper body's coil against the braced right
            knee. To
            correct golf slice tendencies is to relax and swing through
            the ball.</p>
          <p>Try these basic golf swing tips and practice. As they say,
            it
            takes time to get out of bad habits. Just be patient and you
            will enjoy
            your golf game even more by learning these free online golf
            swing tips.</p>
