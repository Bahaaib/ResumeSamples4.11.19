          <p>Practically every weekend golfer looks for golf swing tips
            to
            try and discover the holy grail of the perfect golf swing.
            Unfortunately, like so many of King Arthur's knights, they
            never find
            it. Why not? Is it because they lack the talent, faith or
            hard work? Is
            there some missing ingredient which causes the golf swing
            tips they
            learn to fail for them?</p>
          <p>First of all, many golfers just do not have enough
            practise.
            Golf, like martial arts or any other sport, requires
            practise. Unlike,
            say martial arts, where you only need to practice your kicks
            and
            punches on a flat surface, golf can be much more
            complicated. Golf is
            closer to warfare - you need to practice how to use 14
            different golf
            clubs on a variety of different surfaces and terrain. How
            many of us
            actually manage to practice all 14 of our golf clubs? At
            best, most of
            us only train with two golf clubs - the driver and the
            putter. What
            about the 2 fairway woods? And the irons and wedges? How
            many strokes
            do you lose in the sand trap or bunker because you were not
            familiar
            enough with your wedges? Is your skill with your irons good
            enough to
            get you out of the roughs efficiently?</p>
          <p>So, it does not matter how many golf swing tips you managed
            to
            find. If you failed to get enough training with all 14 of
            your golf
            clubs, 1 tip has the same effect as 10 tips -- absolutely
            zero.
            Consider the example of Vijay Singh. Many golf experts and
            analysts
            have various nit-picks about his golf swing mechanics. Some
            of them do
            not like his posture. Some dislike his backswing. Others
            think he has
            excessive followthrough. But he ignores them all. All he
            does is swing
            his club at the ball all day long. Even during tournaments,
            he is
            reported to practice his swings 3 to 6 hours everyday. All
            this
            training pays off for him - he is a consistent tournament
            winner,
            earning six to seven figures every year in prizes.</p>
          <p>Secondly, too many people rely on finding a silver bullet.
            Instead of practicing their swings and other shots, they
            waste their
            time looking at the latest new-fangled golf club in the
            catalog or golf
            shop. As if getting the latest and greatest driver or hybrid
            club will
            improve their golf swing without any practise. They forget
            that every
            time they change their club they need to re-learn the golf
            swing
            mechanics of that club. This is especially bad for some
            golfers who buy
            new golf clubs like their wives buy new shoes.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, many golfers do not fully understand their golf
            swing
            techniques. They take the golf swing tip for one technique
            and try to
            apply it to another golf swing technique, with disastrous
            results for
            their golf swing. At the most basic level, there are two
            different
            types of swing - the "one plane swing" and the "two plane
            swing". When
            you read a tip, do you know which type of swing that tip is
            meant for?
            Many golfers face serious problems when they apply the tip
            for the "one
            plane swing" to their "two plane swing" or vice versa. For
            your
            information, Vijay Singh uses the "one plane swing" while
            Greg Norman
            uses the "two plane swing".</p>
          <p>Despite the proliferation of golf swing tips and free golf
            lessons online, you only really need one tip to improve your
            golf swing
            technique - just hit the ball more often. That is all. Just
            hit the
            golf ball 10 times more everyday and you will see your
            handicap
            improving (Unless you already hit the ball 1000 times
            everyday).<br>
