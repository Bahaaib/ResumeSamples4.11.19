          <p>We all want to knock off at least one stroke a hole and so
            often this can be done on the green.</p>
          <p>The beauty of practicing at home is no one will see what
            you
            are doing. All of a sudden you will be a star by amazing the
            others on
            the green.</p>
          <p>A missed putt is frustrating, and we have all done that!
            Let's
            see what we can do about it.</p>
          <p>One is often tempted to buy a new putter in the hope it
            will
            solve the problem. Yes, we know there is a certain buzz when
            we buy a
            new club. "Everything will be OK now" and then it is not,
            simply
            because the old habits are still there. By all means have
            your buzz but
            don't spend any more than $10 and get the putter re gripped.
            Then, when
            your fresh habit is working well, that is the time, maybe,
            to consider
            a new putter.</p>
          <p>If the new found habits are working well you may choose to
            keep your trusty friend after all.</p>
          <p>Having just had a re grip that is modern with a flat
            surface
            for the thumbs, my putter feels like new. Goodness knows how
            long the
            old grip was on there! The re gripping was done while having
            a mug of
            tea and a bun after the last round. I came home with the
            "new" putter
            and was looking forward to my next game but in the meantime
            there was
            plenty of practice indoors.</p>
          <p>The success of these tips will be all the greater if you
            keep
            each Tip to a separate day. That way the habit is much more
            likely to
            stay in your mind and be of benefit when you are putting for
            real out
            on the course.</p>
          <p><strong>Great Putting Tip # 1</strong></p>
          <p>After hitting the ball quite well you get on the green. Now
            it's just a matter of getting the ball down into the cup and
            move on to
            the next tee. While this may sound easy, given the short
            distance,
            there are those who still have a hard time doing so. To help
            you there
            are several golf swing drills you can use to reduce your
            usual number
            of putts.</p>
          <p>The first drill is Right Hand only if you are right-handed.
            Put your left hand behind your back. Just reverse these
            instructions if
            you are a left-hander.</p>
          <p>This drill lets you focus on the palm of your right hand as
            it
            moves towards the cup. Place ten balls on the carpet or
            other flat
            surface and set them out in a line and work your way along
            all ten.
            Your target can be say, a cup on its side, or a tin.</p>
          <p>Feet firm, hips firm, head still, looking down at the ball.
            The only movement is the ridged arm plus the putter being
            moved by the
            shoulders enough to draw the putter back to pendulum through
            the ball
            and finish ahead of where the ball was.</p>
          <p>When you do this Right Hand Only drill do be conscious of
            the
            toe of the putter in the follow through. Should the toe turn
            away from
            the cup this means you are turning your hand. You know you
            are doing it
            right when the face of the putter is square to the cup.</p>
          <p>Practice this for 15-20 minutes today and establish the
            habit
            in your mind before moving on.</p>
          <p><strong>Great Putting Tip #2</strong></p>
          <p>Previously you perfected putting with your right hand only.</p>
          <p>Now, for the right-handed we shall look at using the Left
            Hand
            only drill. Put your right hand behind your back. If you are
            left-handed then reverse this instruction.</p>
          <p>Have you remembered the stance? Feet firm, hips firm, head
            still, looking down at the ball. The only movement is the
            ridged arm
            plus the putter being moved by the shoulders enough to draw
            the putter
            back to pendulum through the ball and finish ahead of where
            the ball
            was.</p>
          <p>The emphasis here is for you to concentrate on the back of
            your left hand which is holding the club with the left hand
            only. Think
            really hard about the back of the hand as the club moves the
            ball
            towards the cup.</p>
          <p>As before be conscious of the toe of the putter in the
            follow
            through. Should the toe of the putter turn away from the cup
            it this
            means you are turning your hand.</p>
          <p>To do it right, the face of the putter needs to be square
            to
            the cup.</p>
          <p>Use your ten balls and practice this drill for 15-20
            minutes
            to establish the habit in your mind before moving on to the
            next tip.</p>
          <p>We have had the One Handed Drill with the left hand and the
            One Handed Drill with the right hand.</p>
          <p>So before we go on we'll use the two hands for a few
            minutes.
            When you use two hands you may find you have too much power.
            If so, it
            needs adjusting but do keep the posture the same.</p>
          <p>The stance is all important and bears restating. Feet firm,
            hips firm, head still, looking down at the ball. The only
            movement is
            the ridged arms plus the putter being moved by the shoulders
            enough to
            draw the putter back to pendulum through the ball and finish
            ahead of
            where the ball was.</p>
          <p><strong>Great Putting Tip #3</strong></p>
          <p>Now for some more accuracy, this tip came from a
            professional
            and you will find it a great help.</p>
          <p>Fix up a length of string or tape so you are putting along
            the
            line of string and straight into the cup.</p>
          <p>The equipment is simple. A suitable length of string, and a
            pile of books behind the cup and a pile of books to your
            right as you
            address the ball. The top books have the string tied round
            them so it
            is tight and at a height sufficient to allow the ball and
            putter
            underneath. The ball will travel under the string from the
            putter into
            the cup. Piles of books could be used or soup tins or
            anything else
            which serves the purpose. If you are on a practice green 2
            kebab
            skewers will be good and easily removed without any damage
            to the
            surface of the green.</p>
          <p>Again, 10 balls and away you go.</p>
          <p>When you are putting for real just imagine the string, and
            make allowances for slopes and the condition of the green.</p>
          <p><strong>Great Putting Tip #4</strong></p>
          <p>Sometimes there is frustration when the putter is grounded
            during the putting stroke. To avoid this have a couple of
            practice
            swings to ensure the putter is <u>just</u> above the
            ground then shuffle forward to make the putt.</p>
          <p>These two practice swings register in your mind both the
            weight and direction you consider necessary.</p>
          <p>Remember the point about the face of the putter being
            square
            to the cup <u>and </u>the stance?</p>
          <p>And now an important bit. With the ball in the middle of
            your
            stance do not swing the putter back very far because the
            further back
            you go the more likely the contact with the ball will be a
            degree or
            two out of true. By the time the ball comes to rest it can
            be some way
            off target.</p>
          <p>The way round this is to have a very short back swing,
            maybe
            five inches, (13cm) and punch your way smoothly through the
            ball by six
            or seven inches (15 or 18cm). Make sure it is along the line
            of the
            imaginary string. This is the same as the follow through
            when teeing
            off. The club head is still making straight for the cup
            which is where
            your ball is due to arrive.</p>
          <p>All the time keep the cup in your mind - draw the putter
            back,
            strike through the ball and on, under the string towards the
            cup. So,
            accelerate for five inches, connecting with the ball at four
            inches at
            your chosen power. The club continues for another seven
            inches all the
            time directly towards the cup. And plop! In she goes!</p>
          <p>In other words the putter travels in a straight line from
            five
            inches back to seven inches beyond the point where the ball
            was.</p>
          <p>Practise this under the string without a ball. Make a mark
            where the ball would be to get the feel and point of impact
            right.</p>
          <p>The putter is under control, you are under control and you
            improve your chances of turning in a good score. All of
            which is much
            better than hitting and hoping.</p>
          <p><strong>Great Putting Tip #5</strong></p>
          <p>This last tip builds on all the previous ones and is the
            icing
            on the cake. Your putting success rate will be way up and
            all because
            of one very simple extra aspect.</p>
          <p>When you are on the green you will stretch the imaginary
            string <u>from</u> the hole to the ball.</p>
          <p>And here is the magic. You will identify a point on the
            ground
            about three inches in front of the ball. This is directly in
            line with
            the cup and is the point over which the ball must pass on
            its way to
            success.</p>
          <p>Just concentrate on that point on the ground. Do not look
            at
            the ball, nor at the club and certainly not at the cup. You
            are now
            used to having the head of the putter square to the cup and
            you know
            the ball will pass over the selected point just in front of
            the ball on
            its way to the cup.</p>
          <p>Practice all these aspects, even five minutes twice a day,
            for
            several days, and you will significantly improve your
            success rate. You
            owe it to yourself. Recently there was an enforced lay off,
            and on
            return, the opening score was not a disaster and was greatly
            helped by
            the putting. Your overall score can be cut by using these
            tips on the
            green.<br>
