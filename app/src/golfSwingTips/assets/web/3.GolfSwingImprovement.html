          <p>I'll never forget what Jack Nicklaus said in his Golf My
            Way
            video: "Consistency is the name of the game".</p>
          <p>The only way to acquire a good golf swing is when you can
            strike the ball in the sweet pot of each club and most of
            all when you
            can repeat it time, after time, after time...</p>
          <p>So if you truly want to become a consistent golfer you have
            to
            get serious about consistency and consider it as the most
            important
            goal to achieve in your game through the right golf swing
            improvement.</p>
          <p>Now let me share some proven tips that helped me to gain
            consistency so that you can benefit from:</p>
          <p><strong>REDUCE YOUR GOLF SWING SPEED</strong></p>
          <p>If you like to watch golf tournaments on TV you'll notice
            that
            the golf swing of pros like Ernie Els, Bijay Sing and Fred
            Couples look
            great and especially effortless.</p>
          <p>I remember that in one of my classes my PGA instructor told
            me
            to slow down and try to swing at a 70 to 80% of my speed.
            And when I
            did it I was surprised that my shots reached the same or
            more distance
            than the 100% ones and with more accuracy.</p>
          <p>Then he explained me that "When you slow down your golf
            swing
            you increase the chances to make a better contact and hit
            the ball
            right in the sweet pot of the club. This is because your
            body can do
            your best swing at a more natural motion rhythm".</p>
          <p>He also told me to forget hitting golf balls: "Swing
            through
            the Ball, Not at It" and since applying this concept
            everything became
            clearer for me...</p>
          <p>Every time I executed my new slow down swing I noticed that
            I
            started gaining more confidence caused by my golf swing
            improvement.
            With it I avoid shooting out of bounds and also I started
            reaching more
            fairways and greens than before. And finally this also
            helped me to
            lower my scores.</p>
          <p>Try this tip at the driving range and see the difference.
            And
            if you'll notice that you need a longer club on certain
            distance shots
            it isn't so important because you'll be making more fairways
            and greens
            and start a virtual circle of confidence through
            consistency.</p>
          <p><strong>PRACTICE, PRACTICE AND MORE PRACTICE</strong></p>
          <p>At an early stage of my sport life I always tried to do my
            best. And when I started to play golf I knew that once you
            achieve the
            technique needed as a skill to perform good golf swings you
            must repeat
            it on a regular basis until it becomes yours definitely.</p>
          <p>The golf swing is a very uncommon movement for most
            beginners
            and most of all if they start to play after their childhood.</p>
          <p>If you are serious about being a good golfer you'll need to
            make your time to practice during the week. I remember that
            I use to
            practice 2 or 3 times a week after work at the driving range
            before I
            went home.</p>
          <p>In each of them I did the following practice routine: 100
            balls minimum dedicated to short, mid and long irons and
            then with my
            driver and other fairway woods; another 50 balls in the
            bunker and
            around the green (chips and pitches), and always 20 to 30
            minutes of
            putting green.</p>
          <p>Additionally I had a mat at home were I could practiced my
            golf swing and also a rubber hole to exercise my putter.</p>
          <p>By doing all of this on a regular basis I was able to play
            9
            in almost a year since I started. And by this wonderful
            experience I
            can assure you that, after a good golf instruction, practice
            is the
            only way for acquiring a consistent golf swing improvement.
            So remember
            this: practice, practice, and practice regularly.</p>
          <p><strong>FIND, LEARN AND USE ONLY ONE METHOD</strong></p>
          <p>When I started golf I suddenly remembered what my school
            teacher once said: "I fear the one book teacher". This means
            that when
            you choose the best source for knowledge and skills you can
            be sure
            that you are going on the right track.</p>
          <p>Because you'll find out that there are many PGA pros with
            their own different golf swing and have great knowledge, the
            key here
            is in "your right choice". So once you find your best
            teacher just
            follow his or her golf instruction without doubt until you
            feel that
            you have achieved your own good golf swing.</p>
          <p>Once it's done, avoid looking and copying other methods
            because you will delay your progress to your goal of
            developing a
            consistent golf swing and become a consistent golfer.</p>
          <p><strong>YOUR BEST EQUIPMENT</strong></p>
          <p>Your golf swing needs to be learned and executed with the
            right equipment.</p>
          <p>This means that if you use golf clubs that doesn't fit to
            your
            body you will need to compensate your swing to hit good
            shots.</p>
          <p>So before buying a new set of clubs take in mind that most
            big
            brands offer a free or affordable fitting service for their
            equipment.
            I personally used this service and once I've got my fitted
            clubs my
            only concern was to develop my golf swing improvement and
            gaining
            consistency.</p>
          <p>The golf balls are the other key element of your equipment.</p>
          <p>There are lots of brands and differences en each of them to
            choose the one you prefer. Because they are not made the
            same, and
            according to your feel when you hit your clubs and around
            the green
            there are some structural differences that you should know
            and try
            before choosing the one you like most and according to that
            and your
            possibilities, always look for the best.</p>
          <p>Once you made your choice stick to it and don't change your
            balls every day because you won't find the feel and touch
            you are
            familiar with and this will affect your swing and shots
            loosing your
            consistency.</p>
          <p><strong>YOUR GOLF ROUTINE</strong></p>
          <p>There are special moments were you must develop and
            reproduce
            your same routine that leads you to play great golf.</p>
          <p>As you can see on tournaments, each pro has their own that
            enables to put their game in autopilot after they've done
            the exact
            same routine each and every time.</p>
          <p>Those moments are when you arrive to the curse, when you
            perform your practice, when you are getting to the first
            tee, your pre
            shot routine (grip, aiming, set up, visualization, etc.),
            the pre putt
            routine, are just some examples of all the areas that you'll
            need to
            develop in a consistent routine and get yourself into a
            secure and
            comfort zone and play your best.</p>
          <p>There's always a time for everything and probably this is
            the
            time for you to start playing your best. But first you'll
            need to get
            serious about it.</p>
          <p>Applying some or all of these tips in your game you'll
            gradually gain the consistency that you're looking after and
            you
            deserve.</p>
