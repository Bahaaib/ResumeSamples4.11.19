 style="font-weight: bold;">Your Wedding Attire</span><br>
<br>
As a bride, you are likely already dreaming of the perfect wedding
gown. Whether you are interested in a traditional, classic or
contemporary style, it's always best to begin your search early on,
months before your actual wedding day. To begin, scour the Internet for
wholesale discount bridal shops and wedding magazines to determine the
style you are interested in and to get an idea for the price range of
each style. As you probably know, every website, every magazine and
every offline store will have different prices, sometimes for the very
same gown, so it's very important to shop around ahead of time, so you
aren't rushed into making a purchase, days before your wedding. Since
it's likely that your gown may need alterations, it's yet another
reason why you should purchase your gown well in advance. Remember to
take into account your body type, size as well as the time of year you
are getting married. If your wedding is in the fall or winter, long
sleeves makes sense, or if you are having a summer wedding, a short
sleeve or sleeveless would be more in fashion. Once you have determined
the style and type of wedding dress that you are interested in, start
price shopping. Begin with searching local bridal shops in your area,
as well as online. Most online bridal shops offer a money back
guarantee so that if you are not happy with the gown once received, you
will be able to return it (unaltered) for a quick refund, but be sure
to check through the terms of service and return policy prior to
ordering. You will also want to make sure that if you do order a gown
online that the distributor provides Fed Ex or overnight delivery, so
that you can easily track where your package is as well as confirm
receipt. The last thing you want is your gown to be lost in transit so
always request that a tracking number be provided upon purchase.<br>
<br>
If purchasing your dress from a local bridal shop, inquire as to the
cost of hiring an in-house seamstress, as it's often far more
affordable to hire an outside seamstress for your alterations. If
purchasing a gown isn't important to you, you could opt to rent your
dress as well as the tuxedos and bridesmaid dresses for your wedding
party.&nbsp;</big></p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Check your
department stores for tuxedo rentals and inquire as
to whether there are any special offers, such as the groom receiving
his tux rental for free if the groomsmen rent their tuxedos there. Tux
rentals often include cufflinks, vest, tie and sometimes even shoes so
be sure to ask. Otherwise, search through local thrift shops or outlets
for second hand tuxedos or suits that will save you a fortune while
ensuring your groom and his men look fantastic! Keep budget in mind
when selecting dresses for your bridesmaids as well.&nbsp;</big></p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>While a
bridesmaid
traditionally will purchase her own dress, keep in mind that weddings
can be expensive for bridesmaids and try to find inexpensive options
for them.&nbsp;</big></p>
<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Many internet
stores sell inexpensive bridesmaid dresses at
discounted rates, and these are a good option as long as they have an
acceptable return policy. If you are purchasing your bridesmaid
dresses, be sure to choose something that they can use later on,
enabling them to get far more use out of it.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Money Saving Tip: </span>If you have
your heart set on a designer gown,
consider hiring a local seamstress to create it for you. This can be an
easy way to have the wedding gown of your dreams without the hefty
price tag attached. Simply bring in a couple of photos of the gown you
like, and discuss options with a local (skilled) seamstress.<br>

When it comes to your veil, you can spice up a low priced veil with an
affordable jeweled or tulle tiara to give it a special look, all your
own without paying top dollar for a long beaded veil.&nbsp;</big></p>
