          style="font-weight: bold;">Planning The Honeymoon</span><br>
        <br>
        It seems that the only places people think of when you mention
        "honeymoon" are Niagara Falls and Hawaii! But there are so many
        beautiful and exotic locations that can be just as romantic. If
        you're
        not a fan of Niagara Falls, don't fret!<br>
        <br>
        If the two of you are big fans of the outdoors, why not plan a
        camping
        honeymoon? A quiet mountain cabin near a babbling brook, and
        evenings
        by a roaring campfire can be just as romantic as any beach!<br>
        <br>
        And if the two of you love beaches, remember that Hawaii isn't
        the only
        beautiful location for a romantic honeymoon. There are hundreds
        of
        gorgeous beaches in the United States alone, and many of them
        are much
        quieter and more romantic than Hawaii!<br>
        <br>
        If you love crowds, Hawaii might be a great choice, but many
        couples
        prefer a little more privacy and intimacy than a major tourist
        location. Look for out-of-the-way beaches that offer more
        privacy if
        you think the two of you would like more alone time.<br>
        <br>
        Europe is a popular destination for many couples. There are
        plenty of
        romantic tours of some of Europe's most romantic cities. You
        could
        spend a week seeing the sights of Paris, Rome, Venice, Madrid,
        and
        London.<br>
        <br>
        A cruise is another great idea. If the two of you are big fans
        of the
        sea, a cruise might be just what you are looking for! And don't
        expect
        to spend all of your time on a boat! Many cruises have several
        landfall
        destinations where you can go ashore and spend time shopping and
        sightseeing.<br>
        <br>
        The honeymoon is something the two of you should both enjoy. If
        you
        love the beach, but your fianc√© can't stand it, a tropical
        getaway
        might not be the best choice. You might be disappointed because
        you
        didn't get your dream honeymoon in Barbados, but the two of you
        will
        have a much more memorable honeymoon if you compromise and
        choose a
        mutually enjoyable location together!<br>

        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Conclusion:
          Final Thoughts</span><br>
        <br>
        Your wedding is one of the most special days of your life and
        both you
        and your partner should be able to celebrate your love without
        the
        stress that comes with excessive debt from taking out loans to
        pay for
        your wedding day. It's important to think beyond the wedding
        day, and
        to begin your married life in a way that enables you both to
        continue
        celebrating one another, rather than struggle for years to pay
        off a
        loan.<br>
        <br>
        Set your budget and use my tips and strategies to ensure that
        you stay
        within this price range when planning out your wedding. You can
        have a
        beautiful wedding without spending a fortune in the process, if
        you
        take your time, stay organized and on track. <br>
        <br>
        To your happily ever after!</big></p>
