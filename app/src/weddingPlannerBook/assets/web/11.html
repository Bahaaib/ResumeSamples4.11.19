          style="font-weight: bold;">The Wedding
          Music </span><br>
        <br>
        Depending on the type of wedding you are having, you may want to
        have
        music played during your wedding as well as the reception and
        dance.
        Choosing a DJ is always a far more affordable option than hiring
        a band
        unless you know someone who is experienced and willing to do
        this for
        you. If you are having your ceremony in a church or temple,
        check with
        them to see if music will be provided and what the fee is for
        the
        provided music. Some couples choose to have outside music
        played, for
        example a soloist or violinist, at their own expense.<br>
        <br>
        Hiring an outside musician to play music for your ceremony may
        cost
        quite a lot of money. If you want to have something special
        played at
        your ceremony but would like to save money, check in with your
        friends
        and family to see if anyone is an experienced musician and would
        be
        able to provide their services for you.<br>
        <br>
        If your ceremony is not being held in a church or temple, but at
        the
        same location as your reception, you may be able to have a DJ or
        band
        play music for both your ceremony and reception.<br>
        <br>
        A DJ will bring his or her own equipment and music, or you can
        provide
        music for them to play. A band can vary from a few people to a
        stage
        full depending on the type of band.<br>
        <br>
        In general, a DJ is less expensive than a band because you are
        only
        paying one person. If you do not have your heart set on live
        music, a
        DJ is a great option because they will provide emcee services
        along
        with any music you require.<br>
        <br>
        When contacting your musicians, ask them the following:<br>
        <br>
        * Do you charge a flat rate or an hourly rate?<br>
        <br>
        * How early before the ceremony/reception will you arrive to set
        up
        your equipment?<br>
        <br>
        * Do I need to provide any music?<br>
        <br>
        * Do you have the ability to play special songs that we wish to
        have?<br>
        <br>
        * During the reception will you have a set list, or will you
        take
        request?<br>
        <br>
        * May we provide you with a list of songs that we do not wish to
        be
        played?<br>
        <br>
        When you have selected the DJ or band that you wish to use, keep
        the
        contract with all of your wedding paperwork.</big></p>
