          style="font-weight: bold;">Planning The Reception</span></big></p>
    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>Of all the
        costs associated with your wedding, your reception can be one of
        the biggest costs of all, especially if you are renting space or
        using in house caterers. Discuss what your ideal reception venue
        would be and then research potential spots in your area, by
        phoning the venues and asking for prices, availability and
        included items. <br>
        <br>
        When using caterers that are provided by the venue, you can
        expect to pay 35% more than if you hire an outside caterer,
        however there are many venues that require you use their
        in-house vendors so be sure to ask about this when calling each
        location. One great way to begin your research is by using the
        Internet and scouring through different areas in your location.
        <br>
        <br>
        Quite often, reception halls will post details regarding
        caterers, availability and pricing and in the event this
        information isn't available, you can choose to contact the
        management by email prior to calling, to see if it's feasible
        for your wedding based on your allocated budget. <br>
        <br>
        Create a listing of potential reception spots paying attention
        to the following: <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Schedule And Availability</span><br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        Are these locations available for your wedding day?<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost: </span>Determine whether
        the price is a flat fee or on a per person basis (flat fees are
        usually cheaper depending on how many guests are included) <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Decorations &amp; Inclusions:</span>
        Determine whether decorations, including centerpieces, table
        clothes, flowers, candles and other decor are included in the
        price. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Capacity: </span>Ask how many
        guests the venue can accommodate, as well as the various seating
        arrangements that may be available. Certain venues can hold more
        guests depending on whether they include longer tables versus
        round. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Restrictions:</span> Find out
        whether there are any specific requirements or restrictions in
        order to reserve and use the hall. For example, certain venues
        will not allow candles due to fire hazards and insurance costs,
        while others will not allow certain seating arrangements for the
        same reasons. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Catering:</span> Determine
        whether you are able to bring your own catering service to the
        venue or if you are required to use their on-site staff. If so,
        determine the overall costs for your reception. If you must use
        their staff or recommended caterers, request a full list of
        available caterers and contact each one individually with your
        questions.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Parking:</span> Make sure that
        there is sufficient parking based on the number of guests
        attending your reception as well as ensuring that there is
        wheelchair access if required. <br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time Frame:</span> You will
        want to determine how long the venue is available for and more
        importantly, whether there is another wedding taking place on
        the same day. This can have a huge impact on how well your
        reception goes, especially if you are under a time crunch or the
        venue needs to prepare for an additional reception after yours.
        <br>
        <br>
        If another wedding is taking place on the same day, make sure
        that it ends or begins two hours after yours, to ensure that
        you, your partner and your guests have plenty of time to enjoy
        your event. If possible, try to choose a venue that hosts only
        one wedding a day. <br>
        <br>
        Once you have explored your options and have a list of potential
        venues, it's time to get in touch with each one directly. You
        can choose to do this yourself or delegate it to a close friend
        or family member.<br>
        <br>
        Write down the list of questions that you have and make sure you
        cover it all before agreeing to book your reception at any
        venue.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">The list should include:</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        1) How many staff members are allocated to your wedding? <br>
        <br>
        2) Does the venue provide all seating arrangements including
        tables and chairs or do you need to rent them? <br>
        <br>
        3) Does the venue contain a dance floor, bar and where will the
        DJ or band be located? <br>
        <br>
        4) Does the venue contain a bridal room or area where you can
        change from your wedding gown into your reception outfit after
        dinner? <br>
        <br>
        5) Is there a minimal hour restriction on your reception?
        Certain venues will require a 4-5 hour minimum where you pay per
        hour. Regardless of the type of venue that you choose make sure
        that you visit it in person before agreeing to book it! <br>
        <br>
        A venue can look significantly different in person than in
        photos and you really need to get a feel for the location,
        ensuring that it is spacious enough (or intimate enough based on
        the number of guests), as well as whether it looks clean, is
        well maintained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</big></p>
