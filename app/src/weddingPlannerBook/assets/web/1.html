        <br>
        Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! Planning a wedding
        should be the most memorable experience of your life. After all,
        you are about to begin a new adventure shared with the one you
        love. Unfortunately, when it comes to planning a wedding unless
        you have an unlimited budget, it can be a frustrating and
        overwhelming task. First, you have to determine your budget and
        then you need to do your best to stay within this amount, which
        often means cutting corners and eliminating some of the most
        important elements and features of your day. Weddings are
        incredibly expensive if you go the traditional route without
        knowing how to deal with vendors or negotiate on costs.<br>
        <br>
        With the "Wedding Planning Simplified" guide however, I reveal
        my personal strategies for saving money on all aspects of your
        wedding planning as well as how to ensure that your day goes
        smoothly with little stress involved.<br>
        <br>
        You deserve the ultimate wedding of your dreams, and with my
        money saving tips and techniques; I truly believe that you will
        be able to achieve this.<br>
        <br>
        Step One: Determine Your Budget<br>
        <br>
        To begin, you need to sit down with your partner and determine a
        reasonable budget. Evaluate your finances and how much you are
        both comfortable with spending on your wedding.<br>
        <br>
        This isn't the time to determine the costs of each element, it's
        just the taking the first step in your wedding planning and
        deciding, together, what your wedding fund will be. The
        Pre-Planning Phase is a critical step in ensuring that you are
        organized and on track.<br>
        <br>
        Many couples overlook this very important step, and start
        planning their wedding without a firm budget in mind. This will
        make things incredibly difficult when you find yourself out of
        money and out of time, without the wedding completely planned
        and ready for your big day. Sit down together and determine a
        fair budget. You can always adjust the budget later on down the
        road if needed, but for now, be open with each other, discuss
        possible numbers until you come to a reasonable budget without
        leaving you both struggling to pay off a massive debt once you
        begin your married life together. After all, your wedding is a
        celebration of your love and the last thing you want to do is
        venture into a marriage where you are tied down to a debt that
        will take years to pay off. Consider what your objectives are
        for the first year of your marriage. Do you want to put a down
        payment on a house? Upgrade a home? Take an extended vacation?
        You will need to thoroughly examine what your budget is going to
        be while allowing you both the ability to save for your future
        long after the wedding is over. It's easy to get excited about
        your wedding planning and take out huge loans or borrow from
        friends and family without considering how difficult it may be
        to pay it back over time. Consider your friends and family who
        may be interested in helping with certain aspects of your
        wedding. Perhaps you have a cousin who is a florist or an aunt
        who would be more than happy to play piano during your ceremony.<br>
        <br>
        You'd be surprised at just how many costly elements you can
        eliminate by considering friends and family for certain tasks.
        Best of all, they will be thrilled that you are involving them
        in your wedding day!<br>
        <br>
        When considering your budget, keep in mind that the majority of
        a wedding budget is traditionally spent on the reception. The
        food, drinks, rentals and venue that you choose will take up a
        large portion of your budget, depending on the type of food
        served, the number of guests and whether you are footing the
        entire bill or having friends and family cook, bake and help
        out. Your wedding apparel will take up an estimated 15% of your
        budget as well, and your photographer and videographer another
        10-15% by traditional pricing. You could opt to have a friend
        video tape the wedding for you, as well as a friend or family
        member that you trust, taking your photographs. This will save a
        lot of money on your wedding, however be careful in who you
        choose as you will never be able to capture your wedding again.
        If you find that your budget is far too small, start saving
        every week by deciding to put a specific amount away. You could
        open a bank account that is used exclusively for your wedding.</big></p>
