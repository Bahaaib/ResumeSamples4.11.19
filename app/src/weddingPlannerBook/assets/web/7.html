          style="font-weight: bold;">The Reception Dinner</span></big><br>
      <big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
        When you must use an in house caterer, there is not much you
        will be able to do to save money other than choosing less
        expensive food items. A buffet tends to be cheaper than a sit
        down dinner, and a soda only reception is cheaper than a
        reception with a full bar.<br>
        <br>
        Discuss your options with the venue's caterer prior to
        finalizing your menu details. Many caterers offer a wide variety
        of services, ranging from hot and cold appetizers, to buffet or
        served dinners, your choice of bars and some caterers will even
        include the cake.<br>
        <br>
        The actual food served can save you money as well. Cheaper
        dishes such as pasta or chicken can be just as lovely, but less
        expensive than pricey cuts of meat or expensive seafood dishes.<br>
        <br>
        If you want some of the expensive meat or seafood dishes, work
        with your caterer to see if they can do a seafood appetizer
        instead of the main course. Your guests will enjoy mini-crab
        cakes rather than having them as a meal and you will save money.<br>
        <br>
        Being able to hire an outside caterer will give you a lot of
        room to compare services and prices. Research caterers in your
        area; the reception venue should be able to recommend caterers
        that other brides have used, or you can search on the internet
        or specialized wedding websites.<br>
        <br>
        Word of mouth is also a great resource. Talk to people you know
        who are newly married, or who have attended weddings recently.
        Make a list of caterers that you are interested in, and ask them
        the following:<br>
        <br>
        * Price per Person - get an idea of their price per head for a
        buffet dinner, a served dinner, including/excluding appetizers,
        with/without a full bar, etc. You want to get a price quote for
        every scenario to really compare prices to other caterers. Many
        caterers will supply you with a printout listing of their
        prices.<br>
        <br>
        * Staff - find out how many staff will be in attendance on the
        wedding date. This is usually dependant upon if your dinner is
        seated or buffet, if you will need a bartender, and how many
        guests you are having.<br>
        <br>
        * Cake - find out if cake is included with the catering
        services. If cake is not included, find out if your caterer will
        charge a fee to cut and serve an outside cake.<br>
        <br>
        * Bar - find out if the caterer can provide a bar and alcohol
        (if desired) and if they will be providing their own
        bartender(s).<br>
        <br>
        * Linens - will the caterer provide table linens? Is there an
        extra cost for linens for a gift table, etc?<br>
        <br>
        * Centerpieces - sometimes a caterer will provide their own
        centerpieces at no extra charge<br>
        <br>
        * Alternative meals - instead of a buffet or seated dinner, are
        they willing to accommodate a cake and champagne brunch, or an
        appetizer only event?<br>
        <br>
        When researching your catering options, also take into account
        if you will be serving alcohol.<br>
        <br>
        Once you have narrowed down your choice of caterers, set up a
        time with each to see them at an event and to taste their food.
        Bring your fiance or another person close to you while tasting,
        and take notes while you are there.<br>
        <br>
        Choose the caterer that best fits your needs and
        budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</big></p>
