 style="font-weight: bold;">Planning Catering for Your Wedding</span><br>
<br>
Catering is certainly an important part of the wedding reception. You
will want to work closely with the caterer to choose a menu that will
work well for both the bride and groom.<br>
<br>
You will also need to keep in mind the tastes of any potential guests.
Traditionally there would be a couple of different main courses to
choose from, but these days you must also keep other dietary
requirements in mind. Although you can't be expected to provide for
every dietary need, you may need to provide vegetarian alternatives if
you know there will be vegetarians at the reception.<br>
<br>
Ideally you would want to know well in advance if anyone attending has
special dietary requirements. If possible, ask guests to alert you to
their needs when they RSVP your invitation.<br>
<br>
Discuss these needs with the caterer well in advance so they can make
arrangements. Sometimes they will need to make special accommodations,
so they need to know about this in plenty of time to set everything up
properly.<br>
<br>
People will special dietary needs are usually used to bringing their
own food to events or to going without, so don't panic if a vegetarian
shows up unannounced. It's not the end of the world! But it does help
to be prepared in case this happens. It's always a good idea to urge
your caterer to at least provide one vegan appetizer so any vegetarians
can have something to snack on at the very least.<br>
<br>
When choosing appetizers, it's best to pick finger foods that aren't
very messy. Guests will probably be wearing very expensive clothing,
and you don't want them to have any unnecessary cleaning bills! Foods
like barbecue and shrimp cocktail are almost certainly off the menu.
Cleaner foods like pate and finger sandwiches are good choices.<br>
<br>
The main course can generally be messier, but remember to have at least
two courses to choose from. You and your fianc&eacute;e may enjoy
steak, for
example, but you should have a chicken or fish dish for those who don't
eat red meat.<br>
<br>
Weddings should be focused on the bride and groom, but the other guests
should be made to feel as happy as possible. The happier the guests
are, the more joyous the day will be for everyone. And that will all be
preserved on film forever!</big></p>
