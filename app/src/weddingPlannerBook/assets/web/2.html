 style="font-weight: bold;">Step Two: Pre-Planning Phase</span><br>
<br>
In order to begin planning your wedding you will both need to discuss
what the most important features and aspects of your day will be.
Depending on religion or lifestyles, you both may have specific
elements that you feel must be included, and these can affect the
budget so it's critical that you write down the "no bargain" aspects of
your wedding that you feel you just can't do without.<br>
<br>
If you haven't yet set a wedding date, this is the time to do so.
Consider what time of year you should have your wedding (considering
the guests and their vacation time or ability to attend based on work),
as well as whether you are looking to have a wedding locally or away.
The most expensive months in which to get married are spring, summer
and early fall, as well as the Christmas and Valentine's Day holidays.
If you have a wedding that takes place in late fall or early winter you
will be able to dramatically trim down on costs. Also consider the day
of the week as this will also have an impact on your venue costs.
Weddings that take place during a weekday are usually far more
affordable than a weekend wedding, where venues are in demand and more
couples are trying to secure locations. Often times, vendors will
negotiate on costs if you book during an "off day" because they know
they are less likely to fill that spot otherwise. And finally, the time
of day also plays a factor in costs. Generally, weddings that take
place earlier in the day will cost less than late afternoon, early
evening wedding events. Try to be flexible with the date you choose
especially if it will help you stretch the budget even further,
enabling you to save money or spend it on other elements of your
wedding day that you might otherwise not be able to afford.<br>
<br>
Here are a few other questions you will need to discuss before moving
past the pre-planning phase:<br>
<br>
* How many guests would you like to attend? Write down all of the
friends and family members that are most important to you (Create your
"must attend" list first)<br>
<br>
* What type of venue would you like to be married in? Would you like an
indoor lavish reception, and outdoor garden reception, a smaller
intimate reception?<br>
<br>
* What aspect of your wedding day is most important to you both?<br>
<br>
* How many groomsmen, bridesmaids and other wedding party members are
you looking to have?<br>
<br>
* Will you have a DJ or a band at your reception? DJs are usually far
more affordable than a band<br>
<br>
* Should your wedding have a specific theme, and if so, what?<br>
<br>
* Will you have a buffet style reception or a sit down dinner?<br>
<br>
* Will you have an open bar, limited or none at all?<br>
<br>
* Where would you like to go on your honeymoon?<br>
<br>
These are just a few of the many questions that you will need to
discuss, and while the budget will be affected depending on your
choices, you can always trim down as you need to once you begin
planning. Book off a weekend where you and your partner can discuss
your wedding, away from noise and distraction. Jot down ideas, notes
and suggestions that you both have about your wedding preparations and
what you believe are most important elements.<br>
<br>
This is very necessary if you want to understand one another and ensure
that you include the features and aspects that will make your day extra
special. Remember, these are general questions regarding your wedding
planning that will give you a good idea as what you and your partner
envision as the .perfect wedding. Nothing is written in stone and as
you begin to plan your wedding day, you are likely going to end up
changing certain features, minimizing some of the unnecessary costs and
shaping your wedding day so that it encompasses all of the important
elements while weeding out the costly features that aren't as important.<br>
<br>
I have seen countless couples surprised at just how many ideas their
partner has for their wedding day. Ladies, don't discount your partner
and it's likely he has ideas on what he would like to see included just
as you do.<br>
<br>
It's important that you keep an open mind and listen to each other.
Does one want a lavish reception while the other prefers a simple
buffet style feast?<br>
<br>
Do your best to communicate now before you start planning your big day
so that there are few surprises or disappointments later on. Work out
any disagreements and compromise where needed. After all, this is a
very special day for you both and you should both be a big part in the
planning.&nbsp;
