          style="font-weight: bold;">Wedding Cake</span></big><br>
      <big> <br>
        The wedding cake is one of the most important aspects of the
        wedding reception. The cake will adorn the main table, and
        guests should marvel at its beauty. The cake will feature
        prominently in photos of the reception, and it will be the main
        attraction when the bride and groom cut the cake.<br>
        <br>
        The cake should not only be visually stunning, but it should
        taste great. Many bakeries focus so much on making beautiful
        wedding cakes that they seem to forget that the cake will be
        eaten! You should visit a number of different bakeries, not only
        to get quotes and look at samples, but also to taste some of
        their wares. Most bakeries will be willing to give you a taste
        testing if you call in advance.<br>
        <br>
        Be sure to choose a cake that will appeal to both the bride and
        groom, not only in appearance, but also flavour. The bride and
        groom should agree on the type of cake they would like to have,
        but the bride usually has the final say.<br>
        <br>
        In some cases, there is also a groom's cake. If there is to be
        both a bride's cake and a groom's cake, they can either choose
        both together, or they can each choose one separately.<br>
        <br>
        Remember, though, the cake that is usually cut together is the
        bride's cake, and it should be larger and fancier than the
        groom's cake.<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes you may be able to get a good deal on a cake by
        allowing the bakery to give you the cake they choose. Many
        bakers love to get especially creative, and they are sometimes
        willing to give you a discount if they can create a cake based
        on their own vision. These types of cakes are fantastic for
        their portfolio, and it's rare when they are given free rein to
        create whatever they want.<br>
        <br>
        Often, a cake that is simply decorated will be cheaper than a
        cake that requires many hours of work. In that same vein, cakes
        that are iced in butter cream frosting tend to be less expensive
        than cakes iced with fondant.<br>
        <br>
        Simple cakes with few fillings will be less labor intensive and
        therefore cheaper than cakes with special flavors and fillings.
        Call local bakeries in your area and get price estimates for the
        number of guests you are having.<br>
        <br>
        More couples are deciding to have smaller, simpler cakes these
        days. Some couples are letting their parents bake simple cakes
        for the wedding. It certainly saves money, but it can be
        disastrous if the cakes don't turn out well. If you're going to
        allow a relative to bake your cake, be certain they know what
        they are doing!<br>
        <br>
        A wedding cake can cost several hundred dollars, so it's
        important to try to save money when you can. Just remember that
        the cake is one part of the wedding that will be preserved on
        film, and you want it to be something you will be proud of for
        the rest of your lives.<br>
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Money Saving Tip:</span> Often,
        grocery store bakeries will also create wedding cakes at a far
        cheaper price than local bakeries.<br>
