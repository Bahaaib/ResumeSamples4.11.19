        <br>
        Flowers can be a very expensive part of a wedding. Many people
        spend
        hundreds, even thousands of dollars on the flowers for their
        wedding.
        But there are some tricks you can use to make sure you get
        beautiful
        flowers without spending too much money.<br>
        <br>
        First of all, don't choose roses or other expensive flowers
        unless you
        are really certain you want them. Many brides choose roses
        simply
        because they believe it is traditional or expected. But these
        days
        almost any type of flower is acceptable for a wedding. You can
        always
        opt to add cheaper flowers such as carnations into a bouquet
        with a few
        more expensive types. Or, you may choose one beautiful flower as
        an
        alternative to an entire bouquet.<br>
        <br>
        Be careful with color choice. Some colors of flowers are rare
        than
        others, and those colors will be more expensive. Discuss with
        your
        florist the prices of different colors, and choose one that is
        affordable, but also one that will make you happy.<br>
        <br>
        You do need to coordinate the flower colors with other colors in
        your
        wedding, so that it certainly a consideration. But the flowers
        don't
        have to match the color of the bridesmaid dresses or other
        elements, as
        long as they don't clash.<br>
        <br>
        You may be able to use fewer flowers than you think. Some brides
        go all
        out, and choose flower arrangements for every table at the
        reception,
        and they even have a bouquet for every bridesmaid. But this
        isn't
        necessary.<br>
        <br>
        You can talk to your fianc√© about the flower arrangements, as
        well as
        the maid of honor and the florist. Discuss which arrangements
        are
        vital, and which might be left out for the sake of economy.<br>
        <br>
        The most important thing to remember is to make sure you get the
        flowers you really want. Your wedding day is perhaps the most
        memorable
        day of your entire life, and hopefully you will only have one.
        It
        should be a day you will remember forever, and ultimately you
        need to
        be sure you're getting what makes you happiest.<br>
        <br>
        If you are providing your own centerpieces for your tables you
        have
        many options. You can create floral centerpieces out of fresh or
        silk
        flowers if you are creating the flowers for the rest of your
        wedding.
        If you wish not to have flowers, you can float petals in bowls
        of water
        or fill glass bowls with colored beads for a pretty look that is
        easy
        on the budget.<br>
        <br>
        Candle arrangements also make lovely centerpieces and can be
        inexpensive if you buy candles in bulk, on clearance, or using
        coupons.<br>
        <br>
        If you are not using a florist, you can arrange the flowers
        yourself.
        It may be easier to use silk flowers in this situation because
        they can
        be arranged far in advance, and they may be purchased at
        discount or
        using coupons.<br>
        <br>
        If you do choose to work with a florist, discuss with them the
        best
        flowers to use for the season of your wedding. Flowers in season
        will
        not only be cheaper, but they will hold up better.<br>

    <p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><big>When hiring
        a
        florist, never mention the fact the
        flowers are for your wedding until the price has been
        negotiated! The
        word "wedding" often will cause a hijack in price, so keep that
        in mind
        when considering the use of professional florists.</big></p>
