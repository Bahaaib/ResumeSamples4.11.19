 style="font-weight: bold;">Step Three: Get Organized</span><br>
<br>
The most affordable weddings are one that are well organized, well
planned and well thought out. If you start planning your wedding
without writing down everything that you need, you may overlook an
important element that you will need to squeeze into your budget later
on, so it's important to keep a detailed task list of everything that
you need to get organized. If you have Microsoft Excel, you will find
that it is exceptionally easy to create task lists as well as keep
accurate records of everything from contacts, vendors to your guest
list (including their phone numbers, addresses, who has responded to
your invitations, etc). You can also use Excel to keep an up to date
list of gifts received at your wedding so that you can send out thank
you notes later on. If you are not computer savvy, you can purchase a
wedding planner, which is a simple notepad that contains envelopes and
pockets for important notes and memos. You can find these at your local
stationary shop, or you can simply create one with a binder, paper,
tabs and separators.<br>
<br>
Whenever you talk to a vendor that you are interested in working with,
ask for a business card so that you can add it to your planner for
follow up. Make sure that you have phone numbers, and contact details
for everyone involved in the planning of your wedding including
florists, reception locations, caterers, DJ.s and photographers.<br>
<br>
This organizer will also be a great memory book later on, long after
your wedding is over! You could also add your wedding CD and
photographs to it, creating a scrapbook keepsake.<br>
<br>
When I created my wedding planner I added in a Diary which allowed me
to reflect back later on, and share my thoughts and feelings with my
friends and family. Later on when I had my daughter, I intended on
handing it over to her so that she could understand how every bride
goes through the nerves, the frustration and the secret fears when
planning our wedding.<br>
<br>
Refer to your planner frequently and stay up to date on the progress
you have made. If you are planning your wedding entirely on your own
without the help of a wedding planner, you will find your journal and
wedding planning notebook an incredible asset in ensuring that you've
covered all bases and that you have a handy list of contacts available
whenever you need it. As your wedding day approaches, you will want to
create what is referred to as a &iexcl;&deg;timeline of events. This
will contain
all of the things that you need to have done, in order, prior to your
big day.<br>
<br>
Make sure to confirm with vendors and hired help the time frame of each
element of your wedding (including reception shifting over into a dance
if you choose to have one), and go over the service requirements with
each vendor so that you both understand what is expected. Things To
Remember: Discuss with your videographer and photographer what time of
day is best for your photos as well as how long your video will be
including what elements you want recorded. Be VERY specific in
outlining every aspect that you wish to be captured to avoid
disappointment or miscommunication later on. Print a copy of your
requirements off and hand to each person prior to your wedding day.
Discuss with your DJ or band how long you wish for them to be present,
including any specific songs or music you want played and in what order.<br>
<br>
Print off a music sheet including all of your requirements and provide
to your DJ or band at least two weeks prior to your wedding to ensure
that they are able to play this music as well as give them time to ask
any questions they may have well before your wedding day. <br>
<br>
Talk to your caterer to get an idea of how long cocktail hour will be
(if you are including this) as well as what time your reception dinner
will begin and come to a close. Talk to those transporting you to your
wedding and reception to ensure that they are aware of when to expect
departure and arrival times, as well as if there are multiple wedding
parties being transported in the same vehicle at different times.<br>
<br>
Make sure you give yourself plenty of time in the event of an
unforeseen delay and remember that weddings and receptions often take
longer than expected. When creating your Wedding Timeline always add in
extra time just to be careful. There are many things that can happen
unexpectedly and by allocating a bit of extra time to each function,
you will always be able to maintain your schedule.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ceremony Location </span><br>
<br>
So, you've determined the month of your wedding and hopefully a handful
of potential dates. The next step is in scouting out locations and
seeing what is available as well as the costs. The first step is to
decide whether you intend on having the reception and wedding at the
same venue, typically if you do, it will cost far less, however
depending on the size of your wedding and the available venues, this
might not be feasible for you. <br>
<br>
If you do not have a particular church or wedding venue in mind,
consider renting a hall for both your wedding and reception to save
money. <br>
<br>
Open the phone book and write down the local venues that are available,
calling each first to determine availability and cost. Hosting your
wedding and reception at the same venue also saves time and money by
being able to eliminate transportation costs. <br>
<br>
Many couples also choose to hold their weddings outside in gardens,
beaches or local parks. This can cut down costs considerably, however
it's very important to contact your local town hall to determine any
restrictions that may be in place as well as any associated costs or
fees. Many couples choose to host their weddings at the homes of
relatives, in outdoor gazebos, vineyards and even where you first met. <br>
<br>
As long as your venue is a place that you both feel connected to and is
appropriate for you both, as well as your wedding party (size being a
factor), go for it! It doesn't matter where you have your wedding as
long as you are both happy with your decision and you can ensure that
it can accommodate your wedding guests. <br>
<br>
If your ceremony location is too small to include your entire guest
list, you can also opt for a private wedding with a fewer number of
guests present, and open up your reception site to your entire guest
list, so that they can celebrate your wedding with you while allowing
you and your partner to have your actual wedding at a site that you
both are pleased with.<br>
<br>
When it comes to your reception keep in mind that certain vendors will
charge you for un used space. This means that if your guest list is 150
and only 100 show up, you still may be required to pay for the
remaining 50 seats. Therefore, it's very important to have a closely
estimated number of guests and to discuss with your vendor, prior to
reserving the reception site, whether you will be charged for anyone
not attending your wedding without prior notice.<br>
<br>
The location of the wedding is often debated heavily between couples,
and sometimes their family. Often, the couple will want to have their
wedding in a non-traditional location while the family of one or both
insists that they have it in a church.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It's a tough decision.</span><br>
<br>
On one hand, you want to make your parents happy. But on the other
hand, it's your wedding. Ultimately it is your decision where to have
your wedding. A wedding held on the beach or by a waterfall is no less
valid than a wedding held in a church or synagogue.<br>
<br>
If you want to have an Elvis-inspired wedding in Las Vegas or a Star
Trek themed wedding on a mock Enterprise bridge, that's your choice!
And your wedding will still be just as valid as it would have been if
it were held right in front of the pearly gates!<br>
<br>
There are a couple of main considerations when choosing a wedding
location. First, you should choose a location that your friends and
family will be able to reach. If you live in Florida, asking your
friends and family to all fly to Las Vegas with you may be out of the
question. <br>
<br>
If you are willing to have a smaller wedding with fewer of your loved
ones, that's your choice. But it's something to keep in mind.<br>
<br>
Next, it should be relatively close to the location of the reception.
If you are holding your wedding on the beach, you might want to hold
the reception there, as well. You might rent a nice location near the
beach, or have the reception at a nearby hotel. But asking guests to
drive 10 miles away for the reception isn't going to make anyone very
happy.<br>
<br>
A wedding is already a long, tiring event. After the wedding, people
will probably be tired and hungry. They need to be put into a relaxing,
soothing atmosphere quickly and fed! So remember to locate the wedding
and the reception close together.<br>
<br>
A great idea for many couples is to have the wedding at the home of a
friend or relative. This makes for a homier wedding, and the reception
can be held right on the premises. This is certainly easier
logistically, but it can also be very romantic to have a wedding at the
home where the bride grew up, or the home where the groom's
grandparents said their vows!<br>
<br>
Wherever you choose, just be sure it suits you both. This is a day you
will never forget, and it should be held in a place that will make you
both happy. Don't worry about what anyone else says. Choose the place
that will make YOU happiest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</big></p>
