          Your wedding is supposed to be the most important day of your
          life, but if it gets too overwhelming, you may not enjoy it!
          Knowing the right moves when it comes to your big day can save
          you tons of stress and hassle. This article will give you the
          advice you need to help your wedding day go just right.<br>
          <br>
          An excellent way to save money on your wedding is not paying
          for a photographer. That doesn't mean you can't have video and
          still photos, it just means you need to be creative! Ask the
          best photographer in your family to do the photography for
          you, and then drop some hints that it would be great to get a
          photo album as a wedding gift. It worked for me!<br>
          <br>
          If you are planning a wedding on a budget, then choose the
          theme and colors for your wedding before anything else. This
          keeps you open to a wide variety of options, while also giving
          you and your helpers a good idea of what to look for when
          shopping for deals on wedding decorations. In the end, no
          matter what you pick and choose from, this also ensures that
          the look of your wedding is cohesive.<br>
          <br>
          Make sure that you choose an overall theme for your wedding. A
          wedding without a theme is okay, but if you want something
          memorable, a theme is going to remain in the minds of those
          who attend forever. The theme is easy to create and follow and
          can be anything that ties together your relationship with your
          new spouse.<br>
          <br>
          Keep your alcohol intake low during the festivities. You have
          to remember that you will be in many photographs and have
          quite a few important things to be involved in throughout the
          day. Keep your drinking down and celebrate after the fact with
          your new spouse. You will create happier memories if you do.<br>
          <br>
          If you're having an outdoor wedding and reception, make sure
          that your all of your decorations are windproof. Weather
          conditions can be unpredictable and are usually
          uncontrollable, so make sure to take all precautions to
          windproof everything you possibly can to avoid any decor
          mishaps halfway through your special day.<br>
          <br>
          Rather than break the bank for a towering wedding cake, opt
          for multiple tiers of decadent, sweet cupcakes or mini-tarts.
          These arrangements are beloved for their affordable price
          range, versatility, and convenience. Guests can simply pick up
          a cupcake or two as they leave, placing them in a
          takeout-inspired, embellished cardboard container.<br>
          <br>
          If you are getting married at a hotel, try and negotiate a
          better deal. Tell the hotel about the extra rooms that will be
          booked and the business that their eateries and gift shops
          will enjoy due to your friends and family flying in from out
          of town. You may even get a free suite for yourself.<br>
          <br>
          A wedding can be a difficult thing to deal with, even though
          it is supposed to be the most important day for you. Apply the
          advice given in this article to have your big day flow
          smoothly. This will allow you to enjoy it, just like you
          should.<br>
