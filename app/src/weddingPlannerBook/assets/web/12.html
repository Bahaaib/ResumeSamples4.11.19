          style="font-weight: bold;">Photography And Videography</span><br>
        <br>
        The photographs and video of your wedding day will be keepsakes
        that
        you will treasure forever.<br>
        <br>
        The quality of your media, either photographs or video, is
        dependant
        upon the person taking the photos or video as well as the
        quality of
        their equipment and developing equipment. Photographers and
        videographers can be very expensive, even for the cheapest
        packages
        they offer.<br>
        <br>
        Some photographers will provide video service, but in general if
        you
        wish to have both photo and video you will have to hire two
        different
        people.<br>
        <br>
        If you want to have professional photographs, perhaps you can
        have a
        friend or family member take video of your wedding. Some couples
        also
        choose not to have their wedding recorded on video.<br>
        <br>
        Think about your options and what will be best for your wants
        and
        budget.<br>
        <br>
        Research photographers carefully as you would everything else in
        your
        wedding. Scour the internet and phonebook, and ask your friends
        and
        family. Your reception venue and other vendors may also be able
        to
        recommend a good photographer.<br>
        <br>
        When you are contacting a photographer, ask what camera they use
        to
        take the pictures. Some photographers will only use digital,
        some will
        only use film, and then others will use a combination. Also find
        out if
        they have an assistant that will be with them.<br>
        <br>
        Photographers often offer package deals. These usually include
        some
        combination of printed pictures, digital pictures and CDs (if
        the
        photographer is using a digital camera), photo albums, and hours
        of
        service.<br>
        <br>
        Contact several photographers and obtain quotes from them, and
        then
        meet with a few of them to view their portfolios. Select a
        photographer
        who has a style similar to yours. Maybe you would prefer an
        artistic
        sort of album or a posed traditional type.<br>
        <br>
        A good way to save money with a professional photographer is to
        find
        someone who uses digital and purchase their cheapest package
        that
        includes all of the digital photos on a CD.<br>
        <br>
        If you have all of the photographs on CD without a copyright,
        you will
        be able to print them at a printer, online, or using your home
        computer, and only pay for what you need. Also be aware of the
        number
        of hours you will need a photographer.<br>
        <br>
        If you want professional photos of getting dressed in your gown,
        you
        may have to pay extra for their extra time and travel.<br>
        <br>
        You may save money if you have a friend or family member take
        photos
        throughout the day, and use the professional photographer only
        for the
        ceremony and reception.<br>
        <br>
        The same advice goes for a videographer. Research your choices
        well,
        choose someone with a style similar to your own, and pick the
        least
        expensive package that will provide you with what you need.<br>
        <br>
        If you are looking to save as much money as possible, you can
        investigate other sources to find a photographer and/or
        videographer.<br>
        <br>
        New companies that are start-ups will often photograph or video
        your
        wedding at a very cheap price, because they will be able to use
        your
        photos/video in a portfolio.<br>
        <br>
        You can also try to locate students at art schools, colleges,
        and local
        community colleges that have an interest in photography or
        videography.
        They will be willing to work at a cheaper pay because they are
        looking
        to gain experience and good references.</big></p>
