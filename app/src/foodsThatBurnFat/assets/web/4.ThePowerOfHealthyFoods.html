      Nutrition can be so very important to the human body. Babies won't
      fully develop when deprived of it and adults won't survive long
      without it either. The positive (and often hidden) effects that
      nutrition has on the human body can't be over-emphasized. This
      article can help you to understand more about nutrition and how to
      make sure that you are getting it.<br>
      <br>
      Pay attention to your sugar intake. It's a common misconception
      that drinking fruit juices are a healthy alternative for soda, but
      some juices have as much or more sugar than a soda and very little
      actual juice. Reducing sugar is important for good health so be
      sure to read labels on anything that enters your body.<br>
      <br>
      Even if you feel rushed in the morning or just do not feel like
      taking the time to eat breakfast, stop and sit down and eat
      something healthy. It will boost your metabolism and add some fuel
      to your body for the day. Studies show that those who have
      breakfast each day have more success in losing weight.<br>
      <br>
      If you need help with selecting healthy food choices and planning
      menus, you may want to consult a nutritionist. The services of a
      nutritionist can be of immeasurable value, especially if you are
      feeling overwhelmed with all the food choices out there. A
      nutritionist can help with planning custom menus suited to your
      body type and health status.<br>
      <br>
      Choose whole grain over white breads. White breads are made from
      flour that has been highly processed and has lost much of its
      original nutritional value. Instead, pick whole grain breads. Not
      only are they better for your health, they taste better and are
      more filling, meaning that you eat less.<br>
      <br>
      Give your bread recipes a nutritional upgrade by substituting
      whole wheat flour for half the flour the recipe calls for. This
      will give your bread a good nutritional boost without sacrificing
      lightness of texture. You can also increase the nutritional value
      of bread recipes by reducing the amount of sugar called for by
      half and substituting applesauce for shortening.<br>
      <br>
      When you go grocery shopping, be sure to make a list ahead of time
      and try setting a time limit for your shopping. If you have a
      list, you are less likely to purchase items that are unhealthy for
      you. When you set a time limit, this can prevent you from going
      into parts of the store that has processed food.<br>
      <br>
      Portion out your foods. Measuring the actual amount of food you
      are eating can help you prevent over-eating. One easy way to get
      the proper amount is to use a measuring cup as a serving spoon.
      Doing this makes you more aware of what you are actually scooping
      onto your plate.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of nutrition to human growth and development should
      be obvious. There is no way that it can be over-emphasized. By
      learning from this article, you can bring the benefits of good
      nutrition to your life, and be able to share it with those around
      you.<br>

          Healthy with Organic Foods</font></b><br>

      When you go to the grocery store or supermarket to buy fruits or
      vegetables, do you pick just any produce or are you particular
      about getting organic foods? There is a difference between the two
      and, after our discussion, you may decide that organic foods are
      the way to go. Let’s take a look at the benefits of buying organic
      produce.<br>
      <br>
      While both types of produce may look the same, organic foods must
      be able to meet specific standards of production, including
      specific growing and processing conditions that are unique to
      foods that can be labeled “organic”. For crop foods, the organic
      foods can’t be grown using any chemical pesticides, non-organic
      fertilizer, human waste fertilizer or sludge from sewage. They
      also cannot be processed using ionizing radiation—a process that
      kills bacteria but that some people believe is unsafe. Finally,
      the food can’t be genetically altered.<br>
      <br>
      At one point, organic foods were grown on small farms,
      particularly those that were family-owned and operated. In today’s
      time, however, organic foods are grown on larger farms and are
      more readily available in most supermarkets, co-ops and health
      food stores. In the US, parts of Europe and Japan, the production
      of organic foods is currently federally regulated and in other
      countries, specific organic certification is required before these
      foods can be sold.<br>
      <br>
      Organic foods can include fresh vegetables and fruits, which are
      not processed and come directly from the growers through farmer’s
      markets, supermarkets and roadside stands. Many of these products
      are only available during certain times of the year. One can also
      get organic eggs, dairy products and meat in their fresh and
      unprocessed forms.<br>
      <br>
      Organic eggs are generally provided by free-range chickens and not
      from those kept in cages in large, egg factories. Organic meats
      must not come from animals that have been treated with any growth
      hormones, steroids or antibiotics. Processed organic foods can be
      found in the organic food section of the supermarket but often are
      more expensive than their conventional food counterparts.
      Processed organic foods can include canned products, frozen
      produce, prepared items and even snack foods.<br>
      <br>
      In truth, processed organic foods need only contain a certain
      percentage of organic ingredients. In Australia, for example, a
      food can be labeled “organic” if it contains at least 95% organic
      ingredients. In other countries, however, the percentage can be
      less than that. Even so, those non-organic ingredients must be
      free of artificial food additives and no aspect of the food can be
      processed using chemical ripening techniques, genetic modification
      or irradiation. In some cases, the organic food must be made using
      energy-saving techniques and packaged in recyclable or
      biodegradable materials.<br>
      <br>
      It’s not always easy to identify whether or not your food is truly
      organic. Sometimes, you need to buy directly from an organic
      grower in order to be certain the food is organic. More recently,
      however, foods that are organic can be identified by governmental
      labeling, stating that the food is “certified organic”.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the safety and wholesomeness of organic foods, you may
      wish to do you and your family a favor by buying only organic
      products. The food tastes excellent and you can be assured you’re
      getting a product that won’t be harmful to you.<br>
