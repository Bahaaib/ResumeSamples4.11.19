      Enjoy Your Healthy Diet With These Nutrition Tips<br>
      <br>
      Exercising and trying to live a healthy life is not enough. To
      experience the full benefits of a healthy lifestyle, you must
      learn to integrate nutrition. Nutrition doesn't take a lot of
      effort or time and following the simple steps in the article below
      can bring you closer to a health oriented life.<br>
      <br>
      Make sure you eat foods containing vitamin C everyday. Humans are
      unable to produce or store vitamin C and deficiency can cause soft
      gums, skin hemorrhages, brittle teeth and nails, slow wound
      healing, anemia and eventually scurvy. Good sources of vitamin C
      are citrus fruits like limes, lemons and oranges.<br>
      <br>
      Remove most white foods from your diet. Aside from cauliflower,
      most white foods are starches and sugars, which are generally not
      too healthy for your body. Removing these from your diet can help
      you get ahead of the game in nutrition, because you will instead
      be focusing on healthier alternatives.<br>
      <br>
      Eat roasted beets when you have a sugar craving because it is
      healthier than eating a dessert and it can be just as sweet. Beets
      contain a lot of natural sugars, and they concentrate when they
      are cooked down. Your body will break this sugar down much faster
      than those you would have consumed from a dessert.<br>
      <br>
      Getting enough calcium is important. If you can't drink milk,
      there are other options. There is lactose-free milk or soymilk
      which are both healthy alternatives. Check the labels on these
      "milks" as they should have at least 300 mg of calcium per
      serving. Green leafy vegetables also contain calcium, but you
      would have to eat cups and cups to get the calcium you need.<br>
      <br>
      Simple substitutions can cut out empty calories without
      sacrificing taste. For example, using 2% milk in place of whole
      milk or half-n-half in your coffee can save you some calories
      without the feelings of deprivation. Try using artificial or
      natural sweeteners in cookies instead of sugar or sautÃ©
      vegetables in olive oil rather than butter.<br>
      <br>
      Be careful when packing perishable foods in your child's school
      lunchbox. Foods such as tuna, yogurt, or sandwiches made with
      mayonnaise should never be left out for more than 2 hours to avoid
      the growth of harmful bacteria. Send lunches in an insulated
      lunchbox, or opt for non-perishable foods just to be safe!<br>

      unpasteurized dairy products, many believe these risks are far
      outweighed by the many beneficial enzymes unpasteurized foods
      provide to your body.<br>
