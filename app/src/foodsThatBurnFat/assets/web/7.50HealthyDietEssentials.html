      According to the United States Department of Agriculture, a
      healthy diet as one that Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole
      grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products; includes
      lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, and nuts; and is low in
      saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added
      sugars. But just what minerals and nutrients are vital to our
      health and well-being? <br>
      <br>
      Consider these nutrient-dense foods when you're looking to improve
      your vitamin and mineral intake.<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin A is needed for good eyesight and optimal functioning of
      the immune system. Cod liver oil, dairy products, sweet potatoes
      and dark green leafy vegetables are all great natural food sources
      of vitamin A.<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin B1, also known as thiamin, is imperative to the body's
      ability to process carbohydrates. Whole grain breads, cereals and
      pastas have high amounts of thiamin.<br>
      <br>
      Riboflavin, or B2, can be found in fortified cereals, almonds,
      asparagus, eggs, and meat. It's used in many body processes,
      including converting food into energy and the production of red
      blood cells.<br>
      <br>
      Niacin, also known as B3, can be found in lean chicken, tuna,
      salmon, turkey, enriched flour, peanuts, and fortified cereals. It
      aids in digestion and also plays a key role in converting food
      into energy.<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin B6 can be found in fortified cereals, fortified soy-based
      meat substitutes, baked potatoes with skin, bananas, light-meat
      chicken and turkey, eggs, and spinach. It's vital for a healthy
      nervous system, and helps break down proteins and stored sugars.<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin B12 is needed for creating red blood cells, and can be
      found in beef, clams, mussels, crabs, salmon, poultry, and
      soybeans.<br>
      <br>
      Citrus fruits, red berries, tomatoes, potatoes, broccoli,
      cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, red and green bell peppers,
      cabbage, and spinach are all loaded with vitamin C, which is vital
      to promoting a healthy immune system, and making chemical
      messengers in the brain.<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin D can be found in fortified milk, cheese, and cereals; egg
      yolks; salmon; but can also be made by the body from sunlight
      exposure. It's needed to process calcium and maintain the health
      of bones and teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Vitamin E functions as an antioxidant and is essential to your
      skin's good health. Eat plenty of leafy green vegetables, almonds,
      hazelnuts, and vegetable oils like sunflower, canola, and soybean
      to get this vital nutrient.<br>
      <br>
      Folic acid can be found in fortified cereals and grain products;
      lima, lentil, and garbanzo beans; and dark leafy vegetables. It's
      vital for cell development, prevents birth defects, promotes heart
      health, and helps red blood cells form. Pregnant women need to
      take special care to ensure they are getting enough of this for
      themselves and their developing baby.<br>
      Dairy products, broccoli, dark leafy greens like spinach and
      rhubarb, and fortified products, such as orange juice, soy milk,
      and tofu are all loaded with calcium. Like vitamin D, it's very
      important in helping to build and maintain strong bones and teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Organ meats, oysters, clams, crabs, cashews, sunflower seeds,
      wheat bran cereals, whole-grain products, and cocoa products are
      all high in copper, which aids in metabolism of iron and red cell
      formation. It also assists in the production of energy for cells.<br>
      <br>
      Iron can be found in leafy green vegetables, beans, shellfish, red
      meat, poultry, soy foods, and some fortified foods. It's needed to
      transport oxygen to all parts of the body via the red blood cells.<br>
      <br>
      Potassium can be found in foods like Broccoli, potatoes (with the
      skins on), prune juice, orange juice, leafy green vegetables,
      bananas, raisins, and tomatoes. It aids in nervous system and
      muscle function and also helps maintain a healthy balance of water
      in the blood and body tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Red meat, fortified cereals, oysters, almonds, peanuts, chickpeas,
      soy foods, and dairy products are great dietary sources of zinc.
      Zinc supports the body's immune function, reproduction
      capabilities, and the nervous systems.<br>
      <br>
      Protein is the main component of muscles, organs, and glands.
      Every living cell and all body fluids, except bile and urine,
      contain protein. The cells of muscles, tendons, and ligaments are
      maintained with protein. Children and adolescents require protein
      for growth and development, and adults need it to maintain cell
      integrity. It can be found in foods like beans, milk and meat.<br>
      <br>
      The primary function of carbohydrates is to provide energy for the
      body, especially the brain and the nervous system. Complex
      carbohydrates are the best choice for a stable blood sugar level.
      Whole grain breads and cereals, legumes, and starchy vegetables
      are all good complex carbohydrate sources.<br>
      <br>
      Essential fatty acids play a part in many metabolic processes, and
      there is evidence to suggest that low levels of essential fatty
      acids, or the wrong balance of types among the essential fatty
      acids, may be a factor in a number of illnesses. Good sources are
      fish and shellfish, flaxseed, canola oil, pumpkin seeds, sunflower
      seeds, leafy vegetables, and walnuts.<br>
      <br>
      Though this list is far from complete, it gives a good base of
      knowledge on which to build a healthy, well-balanced diet.<br>
