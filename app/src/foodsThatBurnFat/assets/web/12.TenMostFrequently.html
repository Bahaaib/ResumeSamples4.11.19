      <p>1. <b>How do I know if I'm overweight and really need
          to lose weight?</b></p>
      <p>People used to believe there was an <i>"ideal"</i>
        weight for every height. If you were 5'4", you were supposed to
        weigh
        X. If you were 5'0", you were supposed to weigh Y. Now we know
        better. <b><u>The
            numbers on the bathroom scale don't tell you whether you are
            overweight.</u></b>
        And there is no set number that says you are too thin, too
        heavy, or
        just right. Scales may be handy, but a better way to tell if
        your
        weight is healthy is to measure the proportion of fat in your
        body to
        lean body mass. Health professionals look at your body
        composition-including your muscles, bone, and body fat-for
        someone your
        age, sex, and height. Some people use a tool called the <b>body
          mass index, or BMI,</b> to help decide whether they are
        overweight. For example, if you are a woman and your BMI is 27
        to 28 or
        higher, you are considered overweight.</p>
      <p>Body mass index is a key index for relating a person's body
        weight to their height. The body mass index is a person's weight
        in
        kilograms (kg) divided by their height in meters (m) squared.
        <br>
        Overweight is defined as a BMI of 27.3 % or more for women and
        27.8 %
        or more for men. Obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 and above. (A
        BMI of
        30 is about 30 pounds overweight.) Note, however, that some very
        muscular people may have a high BMI without undue health risks.
        <br>
        Another way to determine your fat-to-lean muscle mass ratio is
        through
        the use of a <i>caliper.</i> A caliper is an instrument
        consisting essentially of two curved hinged legs, used to
        measure
        thickness and distances. It is used to pinch a part of your arm
        to see
        how much fat and lean muscle you have.</p>
      <p>2. <b>What steps should I take to lose weight?</b></p>
      <p>Aside from regimented diet and exercise, a few adjustments in
        how you live your life can create a great impact on your weight
        loss
        efforts. Try the following:</p>

        and
        office.
        <br>
        Walk briskly in the mall.
        <br>
        Choose activities you enjoy &amp; you'll be more likely to stick
        with them.
        <br>
        Take the long way to the water cooler.
        <br>
        Vary your activities, for interest and to broaden the range of
        benefits.
        <br>
        Choose fruit for dessert.
        <br>
        Consume alcoholic beverages in moderation, if at all.
        <br>
        Take stairs instead of the escalator.
        <br>

        <br>
        Top your favorite cereal with apples or bananas.
        <br>
        Try brown rice or whole-wheat pasta.
        <br>
        Include several servings of whole grain food daily.
        <br>
        If main dishes are too big, choose an appetizer or a side dish
        instead.
        <br>
        Park farther from destination and walk.</p>
      <p><b>3. How much exercise should I do?</b></p>
      <p>Provided you're not consuming too many calories, any amount of
        exercise may help. About five hours of weekly exercise may bring
        the
        biggest weight loss for obese adults who are also watching their
        intake
        of fat and calories.</p>
      <p>To maximize weight loss and minimize weight regain, it appears
        that overweight individuals should supplement dietary changes
        with
        approximately 300 minutes of exercise each week, which is twice
        the
        amount recommended for health for the general public.</p>
      <p><b>Remember that we lose weight if we burn more calories
          than we take in.</b> Normal maintenance activities like muscle
        repair and regular physiology and simple walking uses about 15
        calories
        per pound. Someone who does not move around much all day might
        only
        needs about 13 calories per pound and someone who moves all day
        might
        use 17 or more calories per pound.</p>
      <p><b>Every mile walked or run burns 100 calories more or
          less.</b> Another way to look at it is every half hour of
        brisk
        activity burns about 300 or so calories, depending on how much
        you
        weigh now and how vigorous the activity is.</p>
      <p>If you increase your activity by 500 calories a day and do not
        increase your eating, you will lose 3500 calories a week, the
        equivalent of 1 pound. Alternatively, if you reduce your eating
        by 250
        calories per day and increase your activity by 250 calories,
        it's still
        a net loss of 500 calories per day or 1 pound per week.</p>
      <p><b><u>The gym is not always the answer to exercise.</u></b>
        You can do a lot of calorie-burning activities inside your
        house, like
        dancing, cleaning, or even gardening. But if you want to make
        sure that
        you burn this amount of energy in a specific amount of time, a
        gym
        membership would definitely help. You may also check out calorie
        counter sites to know how much energy a particular activity
        spends.</p>
      <p><b>4. How do I spot a fad diet?</b></p>
      <p><b>Fad such as grapefruit.</b> These diets lack
        major nutrients such as dietary fiber and carbohydrates, as well
        as
        selected vitamins, minerals, and protective phytochemicals, such
        as
        antioxidants (substances found in vegetables, which are
        protective
        against disease). Over the long term, by not receiving the
        proper
        amounts of these nutrients, you may develop serious health
        problems
        later in life.</p>
      <p>Also, by not being allowed to eat foods from food groups that
        are "banned," your body will tend to crave for them and cause
        you to
        lose control and start an overeating frenzy, which is worse than
        the
        diets take form in many ways: low-fat, low-carb, high-protein,
        or
        focusing on one food item case that you have begun with. <b>Remember
that
          a balanced diet is still key to full nourishment whether you
          need
          to lose weight or not.</b></p>
      <p><b>Other tell-tale signs include:</b></p>
      <p>Recommendations that promise a quick fix. Beware of
        advertisements that say "eat all you want and still lose
        weight!"</p>
      <p>Dire warnings of dangers from a single product or regimen. Yu
        have to read the fine print on labels and booklets.</p>
      <p>Claims that sound too good to be true. Like "lose 25 pounds in
        two weeks."</p>
      <p>Simplistic conclusions drawn from a complex study.</p>
      <p>Recommendations based on a single study or testimonials. Home
        TV shopping networks are full of these. Remember that these
        people are
        paid to appear in these infomercials.</p>
      <p>Dramatic statements that are refuted by reputable scientific
        organizations.</p>
      <p>Lists of 'good' and 'bad' foods.</p>
      <p>Recommendations made to help sell a product. If the study is
        made by the weight loss program creator or product manufacturer,
        take
        it with a grain of salt.</p>
      <p>Recommendations based on studies published without review by
        other researchers.</p>
      <p>Recommendations from studies that ignore differences among
        individuals or groups.</p>
      <p>Eliminating one or more of the basic food groups.</p>
      <p><b>5. How can I prevent regaining lost weight?</b></p>
      <p>For most dieters, a regaining of lost weight is an all too
        common experience. Indeed, virtually all interventions for
        weight loss
        show limited or even poor long-term effectiveness. Some lose as
        much as
        10 percent of their weight only to gain back 15 percent by the
        time
        they've given up on dieting.</p>
      <p>If you've just lost weight and are trying to keep it off,
        don't rely on diet alone to keep those unwanted pounds at bay.
        It may
        not be enough, no matter what kind of <i>"maintenance"</i>
        diet you follow.</p>
      <p>To avoid regaining weight, the best plan is to stick to a diet
        that works for you -- in combination with exercise.</p>
      <p>Do not underestimate the power of eating breakfast as well.
        Researchers from Queens College of the City University of New
        York and
        other facilities collected data from the <b>U.S. National
          Health
          and Nutrition Examination Surveys</b>, including more than
        12,000
        men and women. Their study was partially supported by the <b>Breakfast
Research
          Institute</b>, sponsored by Quaker and Tropicana, which
        make breakfast foods. Those who ate breakfast tended to eat
        healthier
        foods during the rest of the day. Women-but not men-who ate
        breakfast
        had a lower body mass index than women who skipped breakfast.</p>
      <p>Those findings may be especially good news for women. <i>"Simply
eating
          breakfast may help them control body weight and appetite
          throughout the day,"</i> the research concludes.</p>
      <p>You can lose weight and keep it off long term, but to achieve
        that you must persistently have a low-fat, high-fiber diet,
        exercise a
        lot, eat breakfast, and monitor progress regularly and be
        prepared to
        tighten the reins if straying off the rails. Success is
        achievable
        without having an overly restrained lifestyle and improved
        quality of
        life is guaranteed. People who succeed will tell you how a great
        deal
        of effort is required but that at the end of the day it is all
        worth it.</p>
      <p><b>6. Are over-the-counter weight loss supplements
          helpful?</b></p>
      <p>Weight loss supplements can be prescribed by a doctor or
        bought over the counter in many stores. Prescription weight loss
        drugs
        are used to treat obesity, while over-the-counter supplements
        are
        generally used for cosmetic weight loss. Non-prescription weight
        loss
        supplements include herbal weight loss pills, fat-burning pills,
        and
        many other diet and sports supplements.</p>
      <p>Most clinical tests for weight loss supplements only last for
        a few weeks. For this reason, long-term benefits and side
        effects are
        often unknown until consumers get hold of a product and begin to
        use it
        for months at a time. The human body adjusts quickly to the
        effects of
        many weight loss pills, which is why many consumers may notice
        that a
        weight loss supplement may only work well for them for a few
        weeks.</p>
      <p>Because weight loss supplements are often used to reap
        benefits quickly and with little effort, many consumers do
        little to
        change their lifestyle while using weight loss supplements. For
        this
        reason, even those who see somewhat dramatic weight loss results
        might
        find that they gain the weight back over time. This is because
        achieving long-lasting weight loss requires that a person change
        their
        entire lifestyle. Crash-dieting for a few weeks may help you
        achieve
        your goal weight at first, but clinical tests show that in the
        long run
        the only way to maintain a healthy weight is to have a healthy
        lifestyle. This means eating properly and exercising regularly.
        Walking, hiking, dancing, and swimming are just a few of the
        activities
        that can help you lose weight and maintain weight loss.</p>
      <p>A genuine candidate for weight loss supplements is a person
        who is seriously obese to the extent that it affects their
        health and
        their daily life. In these situations, the risks of obesity
        often
        outweigh the risks of using a weight loss supplement. This
        should be a
        person who is ready to commit to a lifestyle of healthy eating
        habits
        and regular exercise.</p>
      <p>It is important to always talk to your doctor before using a
        weight loss supplement. Your doctor should know your medical
        history
        and perform a medical exam to determine your current health
        needs.</p>
      <p><b>7. Does quitting smoking lead to weight gain?</b></p>
      <p>Yes and no. Not everyone gains weight when they stop smoking.
        Among people who do, the average weight gain is between 6 and 8
        pounds.
        Roughly 10 percent of people who stop smoking gain a large
        amount of
        weight-30 pounds or more.</p>
      <p>When smokers quit, they may gain weight for a number of
        reasons. These include:</p>
      <p><b>Feeling hungry.</b> Quitting smoking may make a
        person feel hungrier and eat more than usual, but this feeling
        usually
        goes away after several weeks.</p>
      <p><b>Having more snacks and alcoholic drinks.</b>
        Some people eat more high-fat, high-sugar snacks and drink more
        alcoholic beverages after they quit smoking. Some feel the need
        to
        snack absent-mindedly to keep their mouths busy on times that it
        is
        supposed to be pursed over a cigarette stick.</p>
      <p>Burning calories at a normal rate again. Every cigarette you
        smoke makes your body burn calories faster, but is also harmful
        to your
        heart. Once you quit, you are no longer getting this temporary
        effect.
        Instead, you are burning slightly fewer calories on a daily
        basis.</p>
      <p>Physical activity and a healthy eating plan may help you
        control your weight. In addition, being physically active may
        ease
        withdrawal symptoms during smoking cessation and help reduce the
        chances of relapsing after quitting.</p>
      <p>While it is a good idea to be physically active and eat
        healthy foods as you quit smoking, try not to worry about your
        weight.
        It may be easier to quit first and focus on controlling your
        weight
        when you are smoke-free.</p>
      <p><b>To lower your chances of gaining weight when you stop
          smoking:</b></p>
      <p>Accept yourself.
        <br>
        Get regular, moderate-intensity physical activity.
        <br>
        Limit snacking and alcohol.
        <br>
        Consider using medication to help you quit if you feel you are
        about to
        get derailed from your plan.
        <br>
        Consider getting professional advice about weight control if the
        weight
        gain caused by quitting smoking will send you over the
        overweight
        standards.</p>
      <p><b>8. How many pounds overweight should I be to be
          considered for a surgical weight loss program?</b></p>
      <p>Weight loss surgeries-also called bariatric surgeries-can help
        treat obesity. You should only consider surgical treatment for
        weight
        loss if you: have a BMI of 40 or higher, have a BMI of 35 or
        higher and
        weight-related health problems, or you have not had success with
        other
        weight-loss methods.</p>
      <p><b>Body mass index is a key index for relating a
          person's body weight to their height.</b> The body mass index
        is
        a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by their height in
        meters
        (m) squared.</p>
      <p>Common types of weight loss surgeries are:
        <br>
        <b>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.</b> The surgeon uses surgical
        staples to create a small stomach pouch. This limits the amount
        of food
        you can eat. The pouch is attached to the middle part of the
        small
        intestine. Food bypasses the upper part of the small intestine
        and
        stomach, reducing the amount of calories and nutrients your body
        absorbs.</p>
      <p><b>Laparoscopic gastric banding.</b> A band is
        placed around the upper stomach to create a small pouch and
        narrow
        passage into the rest of the stomach. This limits the amount of
        food
        you can eat. The size of the band can be adjusted. A surgeon can
        remove
        the band if needed.</p>
      <p><b>Biliopancreatic diversion (BPD) or BPD with duodenal
          switch (BPD/DS). </b> In BPD, a large part of the stomach is
        removed, leaving a small pouch. The pouch is connected to the
        last part
        of the small intestine, bypassing other parts of the small
        intestine.
        In BPD/DS, less of the stomach and small intestine are removed.
        This
        surgery reduces the amount of food you can eat and the amount of
        calories and nutrients your body absorbs from food. This surgery
        is
        used less often than other types of surgery because of the high
        risk of
        malnutrition.</p>
      <p>If you are thinking about weight-loss surgery, talk with your
        doctor about changes you will need to make after the surgery.
        You will
        need to: follow your doctor's directions as you heal, make
        lasting
        changes in the way you eat, follow a healthy eating plan and be
        physically active, and take vitamins and minerals if needed.</p>
      <p>You should also talk to your doctor about risks and side
        effects of weight loss surgery. Side effects may include:
        infection,
        leaking from staples, hernia, blood clots in the leg veins that
        travel
        to your lungs (pulmonary embolism), dumping syndrome, in which
        food
        moves from your stomach to your intestines too quickly, and not
        getting
        enough vitamins and minerals from food.</p>
      <p><b>9. Is it harder to lose weight as I get older?</b></p>
      <p>Most people round out a little as they get older, as a result
        of a decreased metabolism and less movement. Menopause can cause
        women
        to suddenly gain weight, and both men and women find that they
        can't
        eat as much as they did a few years back without gaining a few
        pounds!
        This makes it hard to lose weight.</p>
      <p>Another reason for difficulty in losing weight as you age is
        your set point and metabolism. The set point of your weight is
        predetermined, which means that your body stubbornly clings to a
        certain amount of weight. For instance, some people's set point
        dictates that they won't gain an ounce no matter what or how
        much they
        eat. Other's set points, on the other hand, is set a little
        higher,
        causing them to gain pounds when they catch a whiff of French
        fries and
        bacon cheeseburgers.</p>
      <p>Physiological forces can prevent weight loss. It's possible to
        be thinner than when you were in your 20s now because once upon
        a time
        you weighed less - but it can be a real struggle staying at that
        lowest
        weight. Perhaps that's the secret behind set points: it's still
        possible to lose weight, but just a little more difficult.</p>
      <p>Genetics also have a lot to do with stubborn pounds. Your body
        shape, weight, and size is affected by your genes, making it
        hard to
        lose weight. You see examples all around you, every day, of
        people
        looking exactly like their parents or grandparents - for better
        or for
        worse. You may have your mom's curves and tendency towards the
        bulge;
        your half-sisters have their mother's lean silhouette and long,
        slim
        limbs.</p>
      <p>Watching what you eat, exercising, and keeping informed of
        health tips and low-fat recipes are still extremely important in
        losing
        weight and keeping it off. Remember to strike a balance between
        accepting and loving your body the way it is, and striving for
        health
        and wellness.</p>
      <p><b>10. How do I lose my post-baby weight faster?</b></p>
      <p>Lots of new moms regain their pre-pregnancy figure within 8 to
        12 months. True, it takes time for your body to get back to
        normal, but
        don't despair. Eat properly, get active and let nature do the
        rest.</p>
      <p>If you are not breast-feeding, then don't rush out and start
        dieting. Instead, for the first three months or so after the
        birth,
        concentrate on healthy eating, and develop your own exercise
        plan.
        Then, when your body has begun to recover and when your period
        has
        returned to normal, start following a healthy, low fat
        weight-loss plan
        and you will lose weight just as easily as the next person.</p>
      <p>If your weight gain during pregnancy was no more than the
        recommended 22 to 30 pounds, you should be able to return to
        your
        pre-pregnancy weight within about 8 months. This may sound slow,
        but
        you really can't lose weight much faster and stay healthy at the
        same
        time.</p>
      <p>Breastfeeding may assist you to lose weight, at least during
        the 12 months after giving birth. The process of breastfeeding
        releases
        a number of hormones into your body which helps your uterus to
        return
        to its pre-pregnancy size and shape. However, don't count on
        breast-feeding to improve your weight loss during the immediate
        postpartum period. Very often, it is only when the
        breast-feeding stops
        that the weight starts to come off.</p>
      <p>In addition, don't depend on breast-feeding for your weight
        loss. Otherwise you may get careless about your diet and instead
        of
        losing weight, you may actually gain weight. So be sure to eat
        sensibly, take exercise and allow nature to do the rest.</p>
      <p>If you are breast-feeding there is no reason why you should
        not go on a healthy, low-fat weight loss diet, but you should
        not drop
        below about 1800 calories per day, while feeding.</p>
      <p>The fastest, most effective way to lose weight and regain your
        figure is to make it part of an overall program, involving diet,
        exercise and general lifestyle changes.</p>
