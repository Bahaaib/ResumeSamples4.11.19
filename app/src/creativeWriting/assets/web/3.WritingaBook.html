<span style="font-weight: bold;">Writing a Book</span><br>
<br>
When you start writing a novel you may find doing so somewhat more
difficult than you expected. You are not alone when you make this
discovery, as many novice writers and even published authors find
themselves in the very same predicament. <br>
<br>
Perhaps one of the most difficult things may be trying to discover who,
what, where, when, why and how you are going to develop the next
"Pulitzer Prize Winning" fiction book. This article will provide you
with a number of thoughts and ideas which should make your task not
quite so difficult and much more enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Your mental attitude, about why you are writing the book of your
dreams, may well be the governing factor in the success or failure of
your book. A good attitude would be looking at your book as something
you have always wanted to do, not necessarily as the one thing which
will propel you from rags to riches.<br>
<br>
To help you get in the right frame of mind about this, perhaps you
should check out some of the statistics about having a book published
in the United States. You should know that approximately 162,000 books
are published a year. Please don't let the statistics deter you from
your writing. On the contrary, if 162,000 books will be "born", yours
can be too.&nbsp; In other words, you may well be the next "Best
Selling Author" just be realistic about the reasons you are writing and
the expectations you have for your writing. Doing anything because you
love to do it will always make it easier to complete.<br>
<br>
You now have the right mental attitude now let's move on to what you
are going to write about.<br>
<br>
Obviously, you already have an idea or thoughts on what you want to
write about. If you are a first time novelist, it is important for you
to consider writing on something which you are passionate and have
knowledge of. By doing so you will reduce the chances of you becoming
bored and you can rest assured that if you become bored with the topic,
it will increase the difficulty of writing your book.<br>
<br>
One of the things that ties directly in with the subject of your book,
will be the style of writing you elect to use. Let's presume you are a
police officer and have decided you are extremely knowledgeable and
passionate about solving murder mysteries. Take a trip to your library
and check out as many books, by different authors, about murder mystery
as you can. Read every book and while reading take notes about the
style of the authors writing. You will soon begin to recognize the
style that fits you the best.<br>
<br>
As you are well aware there are many other aspects to writing, which
can make writing a book difficult, they are beyond the scope of this
article at this time. However, by having the right mental attitude,
writing about something you know or very passionate about, taking the
time to develop your own style, you should be able to start writing a
novel which could become the next "best seller" - especially with some
solid guidance.<br>
