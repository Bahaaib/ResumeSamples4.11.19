<br>
Is your book manuscript as professional and compelling as it could be?
Tell the truth; could it use some work to make it crisp and compelling?
Yes. Keep reading if you need some tips to make your book writing pull
readers in by the collar. Also, you'll discover how to write a book
that keeps them reading to the end.<br>
<br>
Use the tips below to help you write your book like a pro and finish
stronger to sell longer:<br>
<br>
1. Write your book title to capture your reader's attention.<br>
<br>
Professional writers know the power wielded through a hot title. They
realize a dud title versus a sizzler title can cause their book to
plummet or soar in sales. Knowing this, you owe it to yourself and
book's success to develop your best title. After all, the better your
title the more people will reach out and grab your book to read.
Develop your book title to have top seller status.<br>
<br>
2. Develop your opening paragraph with a hook.<br>
<br>
Many unseasoned writers don't realize the importance of starting with a
hook (something to capture your reader's attention and entice them to
read further.) Create a sizzling start. Hook your readers through
emotion. Slant your book or introduction with a title or an amazing
statistic. Share the top benefits of your book early. Target the 'You'
in every reader.<br>
<br>
3. Write a 1-2 sentence thesis for your book.<br>
<br>
Following your short introduction including your hook (opening
statement), write your thesis. Make it simple; let your readers know
what benefits await them if they keep reading. For example, one author
friend uses sizzling bullet points to entice the reader into the
chapter.<br>
<br>
4. Write each chapter to support your thesis.<br>
<br>
Experts know a book centered around one central become top sellers.
Write a thesis for your book as a whole and each chapter. Book writing
with a thesis will help you create a more compelling, organized and
easy to read book.<br>
<br>
5. Write your book with the self-editor off.<br>
<br>
Don't try to write your book and self-edit as you go. It slows you down
and may even make you lose momentum. Get it out on paper then self-edit
for re-writing. Get feedback from your friends and associates. A
writer's group is a good place to get feedback. Then invest in a
professional editor.<br>
<br>
6. Shorten your book introduction.<br>
<br>
Entice your reader with the main benefit (main central thought) early
to keep them reading. Write the rest of your piece to support your main
central thought. Sprinkle the rest of the benefits throughout your copy
in descending priority.<br>
<br>
7. Slash passive structures.<br>
<br>
Use emotional, power verbs to show instead of tell. Passive sentences
slow and dull your writing. Get rid of the passive voice sentences.
Give your sentences a clear subject and a verb to avoid the passive
voice. "The writer found fame and fortune through marketing her books
online." instead of "The writer's books were instrumental in leading
her to fame and fortune." Avoid connecting verbs like 'was', 'is',
'had', and 'seemed'.<br>
<br>
If you don't put these How to Write a Book tips into practice you could
end up this time next year still writing dull, boring copy for your
book. Instead, you could take my advice and attract a host of ezine
publishers, other web sites and book readers searching for more of your
material?<br>
<br>
The best part is they'll come prepared to pull out their card and buy
because your writing caught their attention and kept it. Now go; write
your book like a pro to finish stronger and sell longer.<br>
