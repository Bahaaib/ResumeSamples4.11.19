<span style="font-weight: bold;">Applying Neuro - Linguistic Method in
Creative Writing</span><br>
<br>
A lot of Linguists and other scientists tried to establish a lot of
methods to improve human memory and make the chain of thoughts and
ideas more fluent and coherent. Robert Dilts was one of the scientists
that established Neuro-Linguistic Programming as a way to improve
writing skills and make then overall view of possibilities clearer. The
scientist worked along with his colleagues and observed the work of
professional writers to see the main difference. The presentation of it
showed that it really helps to improve writing skills. This method can
be used by individuals regardless their age.<br>
<br>
The main aim of the Programming is: To determine the most active sense
and concentrate on tailoring other four to it; To learn to concentrate
on the topic and switch on imagination when necessary; Lexical
interchanges make your vocabulary richer and nobler. <br>
<br>
The most important thing about writing is the topic examination. Thing
about it as of the thesis statement of your paper and focus on possible
styles you may use to depict all you have in mind: it may be a
narration, a description, a memo or fiction. Do not forget about the
reader&rsquo;s preferences and desires. It may be a good idea to make a
sketch of what are you going to present in a chronological or
functional order and work in the direction you outlined yourself. The
preliminary stage concerning your composition is ready. Now it is all
about arrangement there are also several methods that can suit you.<br>
<br>
1. If it is hard for you to formulate a bridge between the sentences,
put a connection word you like at the end of each sentence in your mind
to make it easier for you to comprehend the idea of previous sentence.
This is a way to systematize your thoughts. <br>
<br>
2.&nbsp; English is a poly-semantic language rich in synonyms that may
be used in different meanings according to the text. Use the
interchangeable variants to make it easier to orient within the text.
This gives your language fluency you never had in your oral speech. <br>
<br>
3. Instead of interchanging words you can alter them. The more lexical
units that qualify the subject you use (adjectives, adverbs,
participle, gerund etc.), the better. Be sure to apply this into the
right style (your text may contain direct speech). A cue you&rsquo;ve
established has to be composed of narrator&rsquo;s position, connection
and sensory verb. <br>
<br>
The narrator&rsquo;s position and sensory verb are to stand at the
beginning of the paragraph. The connection can be placed anywhere in
the text that follows. This is what helps you to develop a unique and
outlandish style that is going to become a sample for your course
mates. <br>
<br>
4. Having mastered several methods, you can successfully use them and
mix to your own liking and your abilities will improve with every
written assignment. Linguistic research shows that this method is
helpful in 92% of cases and the easy application of it makes the
studying process enjoyable.<br>
