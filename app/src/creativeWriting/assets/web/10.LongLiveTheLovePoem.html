<span style="font-weight: bold;">Long Live The Love Poem</span><br>
<br>
Long live love poems: There's no chance the love poem is dead, the
reason? Because the one you write is for the one you cherish the most
and it will be a part of you both forever. Writing a poem is all about
observing the world within you or around you and leaving all
expectations behind.<br>
<br>
For the cash-strapped, or romantically inclined, writing a sincere,
well thought out love poem may be just the ticket to your loved one's
heart. Love poems, friendship poems, sad poems, romantic poems, or any
poem that you can think of may mean more to someone then any gift ever
could. If you are writing challenged, poems-online.com can show you how
to write the perfect poem to get the one you're after.<br>
<br>
For example, romantic love poems exhibit an intense sense of love felt
by a lover but must also poses the elements of a poem: elegant
structure, classic rhyme scheme, and beautiful imagery.<br>
How?&nbsp; Well poetry's use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other
stylistic elements of diction often leave a poem open to multiple
interpretations.&nbsp; As we've often discussed, poetry can be about
anything.<br>
<br>
You should view poetry in an entirely new and innovative way. For
example, Edgar Allan Poe, although probably best known for his macabre
stories, also wrote poetry and loved to experiment with the sounds of
words.<br>
<br>
While some may find poetry intimidating or irrelevant, there are people
who poetry as Hope. I've been writing poetry since I was about 11 years
old and wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do without it.<br>

<br>
There are many different techniques and forms you can use when writing
a poem, but we won't go into them here because, honestly, they aren't
that important. Writing a poem is all about observing the world within
you or around you. Try writing out an answer to the title, "What is
this poem about.<br>
<br>
It's true that many of us tend to be jaded when it comes to romantic
writing as it seems old fashioned. When I'm writing a poem, I hardly
consider its contemporary context. Writing a poem is a voyage of
discovery. Besides, a poem can be about anything -- pets, family,
friends, things you like to do. Your poem is not an editorial. Your
poem is very good and beautiful. Read it out loud, slowly!<br>
<br>
As is true of most of us, the poet's understanding of an experience is
a gradual realization, and the poem is a reflection of that epiphany.
So nobody truly knows where the poem is, nor should they. As soon as a
poem is finished to your satisfaction, mail a copy to a trusted friend
and ask him or her to keep it along with the cancelled envelope. For
time, waits for no man.<br>
