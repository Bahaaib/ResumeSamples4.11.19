<span style="font-weight: bold;">Content Or Passion: Balance In The
Writing Journey</span><br>
<br>
Is it better to participate in content writing or write for magazine
publication?<br>
<br>
The above title is actually multifaceted and can help you determine
the overall thrust of your freelance writing career.<br>
<br>
It has been estimated that a writer will need to pen a million words
before a publisher is likely to accept their first work. That means a
lot of rejection slips.<br>
<br>
So, does that imply that content writing is preferred to the crafting
of a book or magazine article?<br>
<br>
Well not exactly. Content writing is a means of addressing a short-term
need. If the immediate need is cash, then content writing might provide
the answer. However, if you are looking for a means of affecting
long-term royalty payments or a greater flexibility in the ownership of
your material you may look at other publishing options.<br>
<br>
When you agree to write content for a client you are essentially
providing a service for hire. Once you release the article or story to
the client and they reciprocate with a payment you have no further
interest in the article. You can't use it again and you will gain no
further payment for its ongoing use.<br>
<br>
When you write a story for potential use in a book anthology, or a full
manuscript for publication, you may have a variety of rights to
consider.<br>
<br>
If you are the author of a story, you can negotiate with a publisher
for the rights you are willing to provide. You could provide First
North American Rights, which would allow you to resell the story in the
future as a second right, but you would also have the capability of
selling first rights to someone else on an international basis.
Nonexclusive rights allow you to continue selling the material with the
same rights to as many publishers as are interested.<br>
<br>
As we venture back to the original title it is important to
understand that freelanced writing can and should be a balanced
approach to writing. If it takes you a million words before you find
publishing success why not make some of those words available to a
paying content market to provide some skills-based writing while you
work on other projects that are more personal and may have the
potential to provide long-term residual payments.<br>
<br>
A writer should always find time to write about the things they are
passionate about, however the service of content writing provides a
means of gaining some writing income while learning new skills and
writing techniques while you are waiting for a publisher's acceptance
letter.<br>
